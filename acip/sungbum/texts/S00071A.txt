Eight Verses for Developing the Good Heart,
written by the Kadampa Geshe named Diamond Lion,
from the Plains of Langri


(1)

May I think of every living being
As more precious than a wish-giving gem
For reaching the ultimate goal,
And so always hold them dear.

(2)

When I'm with another, wherever we are,
May I see myself as the lowest.
May I hold the other as highest,
From the bottom of my heart. 

(3)
As I go through the day may I watch my mind,
To see if a negative thought has come;
If it does may I stop it right there, with force,
Since it hurts myself and others.

(4)

At times I will meet bad people,
Tormented by strong bad deeds and pain.
They are hard to find, like a mine of gold;
And so may I hold them dear.

(5)

Some jealous person might do me wrong,
Insult me, or something of the like;
May I learn to take the loss myself,
And offer them all the gain.

(6)

There may be times when I turn to someone
With every hope they'll help me,
And instead they do me great wrong;
May I see them as my holy guide.

(7)

In brief may I give all help and joy
To my mothers, directly or some other way;
May I take all the hurt and pain of my mothers
In secret upon myself.

(8)

May none of this ever be made impure
By the eight ideas of things;
May I see all things are illusion, and free
Myself from the chains of attachment.
