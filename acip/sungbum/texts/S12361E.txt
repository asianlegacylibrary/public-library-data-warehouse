@347 INTRODUCTION

In the great land of Mongolia, there have been three propagations of the Dharma: Earlier, Middle and Later. The Middle and Later propagations have been through Tibet, the Land of Snows, and the Earlier one through Li-yull, when Sogdian2 savants came to Mongolia, With the Uigurs3 as their teachers (bakshi),

Li-Yul is usually interpreted as Khotan. According to Prof. Dr Rinchen it can also refer to Sogdiana and the Tokharian Kingdom. The Tokharians are frequently referred to in the heroic folksongs of Mongolia, Which have been collected by Prof. Rinchen.

The three propagations of the Dharma are concisely dealt with in Byan- phyogs Hor gyi yul-du dam-pahi chos rin-po-che hbyun tshul-gyi gtam-rgyal bkra-sis chos dun bzhad-pa sgra-dbyans zhes-bya-ba written by Sudhih Asvaghosa (folio 16a line 5), Which is the Sanskrit name of Blo-bzan-rta-dbyans alias Rtsa-ba-bla-ma alias Blo-bzan-rta-mgrin (for his biography see & 59 of this work). The Earlier propagation is dealt with in sarga 2 (folios 5a5-8a2) entitled Bstan-pa sna-dar hbyan tshul-gyi sa-rga ste gnis-paho #, the Middle propation in sarga 3 (folios 8a2-10b2) Bstan-pa bar-dar hbyun tshul-gyi sarga ste gsum-paho #, and the Last propagation in sarga 4 (folios 10b2-12b3) Bstan phyi-dar hbyun tshul-gyi sarga ste bzhi-paho #

2 Sog-thag zhes-pahi Hor-mi, Yu-gur mon-gol: the generalisation of the Sogdians and Uigurs as Mongols is due to the influence of the Tibetan tradition. Sometimes the eastern Mongols are differentiated as Hor, and the western as Sog (Prof. Rechen), but this differentiation is not strict.

3 According to Mongolia's oral tradition there were Mongolian translations from Sogdian and Uigur which were ultimately from Sanskrit. Before the communist revolution teachers (bakshi) taught these orally, and they had been thus handed down from generation to generation. Now they are lost to secience. 
@348 they spread the Dharma as it had come from India. It those days the Mongols uttered the formula of refuge (skyabs-hgro) and other religious recitations (chos-hdon) in the language of India i.e. Sankrit. Therefore in ecclesiastical Mongolian (Hor-gyi chos-skad) there are many Sanskrit words. Further in the reign of the first Sui emperor Wen-ti1 [58(590)-604] of China, North Indian Pandita Sakyahi-rigs (= Sakyavamsa), Narendrayasa, and many other teachers came to Mongolia for the well-being of the people. Mongolian scholars also went to India, became proficient mahapanditas in the Five Sciences (rig-pahi-gnas lna). But it is the Later Propagation of the Dharma from Tibet which fourn expression in the literary oeuvre of the Mongolian saint-scholars. To this renaissance we owe all the sumbums written by Mongols in the Tibetan language which became the medium of their cultural refinement. Gombojab2, rightly points out that mongolists have not taken in the Mongolian language but in Tibetan and that these works have been accaimed even in Tibet. Gombojab gives a list of such 208 xyligraphed and hadwritten Mongolian sumbums. A number of them are included in the present volume, which is devoted to the works of Lamas who upheld, preserved, and increased the Dharma by their compositions.

40. Nag-dban-(blo-bzan-)mkhas-grub of the Kyai-rdor-gyi mkhan-po was the Grand Patriarch (mkhan chen) of Urga. He was born in a place called Mandala on the northern side of the Tuyula River near the mountain Boyda qan ayula (the present-day Choibalsan 01), in 1779 A.D. He went to Urga in his childhood and in the presence of Nag-dban-hphrin-las he became a pravrajita and took the vows of a sramanera and got the name Nag-dban-mkhas-grub. He got admitted into the great College of Bkra-sis-chos-hphebs and studied the Pramana-vartika. Then he went to Tibet and entered dpal-ldan Bkra-sis-sgo-man datsan. There he came into contact with several leading scholars. He studied the Sutras and Tantras assiduously and became a well-versed scholar. He got his upasampada in the presence of the Dalai Lama Hjam-dpal-rgya-mtsho. Having gone through all the five yig-chas, he got the degree of Rab-hbyams- pa3. Then on the way back to his country, in the college of Kumbum Byams-pa-glin he conducted a religious disputation (dam-bcah). On reaching his country, he devoted himself to pious deeds. In succession he became the Chos-rje, Deputy Khampo (ded mkhan-po) and the

48. Mkhan-chen Chos-rgyal5 wrote short opuscules: some of them only a few slokas in extent. A copy of his sumbum exists at the State Library of Ulan-bator (KA-NA). We have reproduced the titles from its index-cards, which do not indicate the number of folios. The first volume (KA) begins with a guruyoga adhyesana written ex tempore in the presence of Dge-slon Nor-rgyan-pa (6763), stotras to various lamas (6764-6773), different types of deigraphic works (6780 seq.), slokas written before the very presence of eminent lamas (6792, etc.), pranidhanas, gathas (6807, etc.), sthirana (6820), balividhis (6824, etc.), sadhanas (6883 seq.), ------------------------------------------------------------- 1 It means fundamental, independent interpretation of the Prajnaparamita. According to earlier Tibetan authors there are four such classes of works, but according to the school of Tson-kha-pa there are only two. For a detailed discussion see E.

The fourth and final volume (NA) treats medicine (6948-6954) and astrology (6955-6959). In the first volume polymath's capa-bilities as an asukavi are emphasised frequently.

49. Dge-hdun-hjam-dpal-grub-pahi-rdo-rje alias Nag-dban-dge-hdun-rgya-mtsho, the Rgya-mkhar rin-po-che wrote an avadana of Ses-rab-rgya-mtsho (6966 in 20 f.), avadana of rajaputra Chos-kyi-dgah-ba (6971 in 21 f.), an epitome of the Grub-mthah chen-mo of Hjam-dbyans-bzhad-pa (6972 in 24 f.), Kalacakra (6976 in 32 f.), synopsis of a Vimalaprabha commentary by the glin-bsres1 lama of 1887 (6978 in 190 f.), a collection of stotras (6981 in 40 f.).

Hereafter the folios of the karchag are not available to us, so it is difficult even to say how many volumes the polygraphist wrote.

50. Four authors by the name Bstan-dar are known. They are distinguished by a prename, their academic degree as well as their town:

(i) Mkhas-grub-bstan-dar3 of Sera

(ii) Nag-dban- bstan-dar lha-rams-pa4 of Alagsha

(iii) Bstan-dar sman-rams-pa5 of Dalai Wang

5 Sman-rams-pa of Dalai Wang in Sayin Nayan Qan. He belongs to the 20th century. He wrote two volumes, which include inter alia a commentary on the medical classic Rgyud-bzhi. The sumbum was xylographed in Urga (Gombojab, Tobed, no. 84).

6 He is to be distinguished from Bsad-sgrub or more fully Grags-pa-bsad-sgrub of Chone in Amdo (Vostrikov p. 56). There are two copies of his 11-volume sumbum in the Institut Vostokovedeniya (Schimdt-Bohtlingk, Verzeichnis, nos. 312-322 and 446-456).

@359 snags-rams-pa or Doctor of Esoterics from Qandu (?) Cing Wang in the Tusiyetii Qan qosiyun. His sumbum was xylographed in the same qosiyun2. We have reproduced the karchag from the xylographed original in the Gandang Monastery. It begins with the opuscules of other polymaths in the first section of volume KA which is split up into two sections (dan-po, gnis-pa). In the first part there is a biography of jibcundampa V (7020 in 31 f.). In the second section there is the polymath's own synopsis of the medical princeps Rgyud-bzhi (7030 in 34 f.), and a detailed memorandum on the Madhyamakaloka3 of Kamalasila (7031 in 203 f.), In the second volume (KHA) there is a study on the Rtags-rigs (7033 in 71 f.), exposition of Tson-kha-pa's commentary on the Abhisamayalankara entitled Gser-phren4 (7034 in 28 f.), clarification of the madhyamaka in the Kasyapapari-varta (7037 in 28 f.), and an explanation of vinaya time-computation5 (7039 in 156 f.). In the third volume (GA) is a biographic (?) work (7050 in 164 f.), rites pertaining to Amoghapasa (7053 in 22 f., 7054 in 42 f.), mandalavidnis of Ekadasamukha Mahakarunika (7055 in 27 f.) and of 37 atmika Vajrayogini (7059 in 22 f.), and corrigenda to a Mdo-man.

51. Bstan-dar lha-rams-pa of the Alashan6-Olots is variously referred to as Smon-lam rab-hbyams-pa Nag-dban-bstan-dar7, Smon-lam bla-ma8, Alasa lha-rams-pa Nag-dban-bstan-dar9, A-lag-sa Bstan-dar lha-rams-pa10 and Nag-dban-bstan-dar lha-rams- pa11. He was eighty years of age when he published his Tibetan-Mongolian Dictionary in 1838 A.D. So his date of birth can be reckoned to 1758 A.D.12 In 1839 A.D., at the age of 81 he wrote a work on Blo-sbyon (7089) which confirms this date. His sumbum13 was xylographed at Kumbum11.

His contribution to rhetorics is evidenced by illustrations of Kavyadarsa10 (7095 in 34 f.), and other works (7096, 7097). The collection of his letters11 (7098 in 42 f.), and his unfinished work (rtsom hphro) on the Pramanavartika12 may also be mentioned.

53. Mthu-stobs-ni-ma is known for his compilation of a biglot Tibetan- Mongolian ritual guide Arban jiryuyan dusul-un jang iiile-diir ecige-yin nom-aca nemejii kereglekii cindamani-yin erike, kobegun oberiin iindiisiin-i duradqaysan ba. jorin iriigejii oljei iigiilekii selte orusiba at the instance of Efu Burnabala (skt. Punyapala, Tib. He-bu Bsod-nams-skyon). Its Mongolian ductus corresponds to the Peking prints of the period of Rol-pahi-rdo-rje2. His Tibetan works were also printed at Peking3. The present karchag is based on the title covers of the copy at the National Library of Peking, and so the folio numbers could not be indicated. The writings pertain to the ten akusala (7187), commentary on Lean-skya I Blo-bzin-chos-ldan's alambanakrama of the Lam-rim (7189), three samvaras (7191), the twelvefold pratityasamutpada4 (7192), and adhyesanas to Klon-rdol bla-ma (born in 1729 A.D.)5 and Thukvan (probably the second incarnation: 1679-1735 A.D.). From these it appears that he was a contemporary of Lean-skya II Rol-pahi-rdo-rje.

54. Dam-tshig-rdo-rje, the siddhesvara Brag-ri yons- hdzin was born in 1781 in the Left Wing of the Khalkhas in the Tusiy-e gung-un qosiyun. He took the vows of a sramanera after becoming a pravrajita in the presence of Noyan qutuy-tu Ye-ses-don-gnis-lbun-grub. At Urga he was admitted in the Bkra-sis-chos-hphel datsan where he studied with zeal. At the age of 21 he got the full ordination of a bhiksu from Stag-lun-pa Nag-dban-hphrin-las. Next year he went to Bla-bran-bkra-sis-hkhyil and got admission into the college. For two years he heared in details the discourses of Gun-than Bstan-pahi-sgron-me and others. At the age of 24 he pro-ceeded to Tibet and entered the great college of Sera. For sixteen years he heard the Sutras and Tantras from several acaryas at great length and became a perfect scholar He became the guru of Panchen Lama Phyogas-las-rnam-rgyal, Gu-ge, Bstan-hdzin-rgyal-mtshan and several other leading personalities of Tibet.

The xylographed karchag2 was available to us only upto the near-end of the first volume. The titles of the second volume (KHA) have been supplied from the index cards of the State Library of Ulanbator which are unfortunately reduces to the indicative minimum. For instance the first title of the sumbum is Rje sku-phren brgyad-palu bla-mahi-rnal-hbyor in the cards which purely descriptive and cannot lead us to the title which runs Rje-bstun Nag-dban-blo-bzan-chos-kyi-ni-ma-bstan-hdzin-dban-phyug dpal-bzan-po-la bsten-pahi-bla-mahi-rnal-hbyor byin-rlabs myur hjug in the xylographic karchag.

@369 from his sumbum refer to him as Rtsa-ba Rta-mgrin, because of his appellation rtsa-ba bla-ma1 `the guru who [knows all] the originals'. Gombojab speaks of him just as Rta-mgrin2. This famed dkah=eeu of Urga was born in 1867 in Uijung gung in Gobi. At the age of 4 he learnt the aphabet from Acarya Sans-rgyas. Then from aqu Lama he studied the monastic recitations and the art of translating into the classical language. At the age of 17 he went to Urga and entered the Kun-gdan-chos-glin monas tery. Sitting at the feet of several scholar-saints like mkhas- dban Hjigs-byed, he worked diligently on the sutras and Tantras and became an eminent scholar. He had already become an upasaka and pravrajita in the presence of acarya Sans-rgyas who had gone to aryadesa (i.e. India). Later he became fully ordained in the presence of the Khampa (mkhan-chen) of Urga Dpal-ldan_chos -hphel. At the age of 40, in 1906, he got the degree of Dkah-bcu Then he went to Wu-t'ai-shan (Ri-bo-rtse-lina_ and from an inner most apartment of the ser-phyin-lha-chan he brought out two miraculous stupas inscribed with magic letter (hphrul-yig).Trying to find out the remains (? dmar-gdun)of Pandita sri Ashraka, which no one had been able to find earlier, while he himself was digging out the thick mud of the boundary-wall he found a quadrilingual inscription on a white stone slab. In 1922 he built a Tantra College in his monatery, in 1926 the choister Bhah-gdams -chos-sdins, and the college of Sgo-man yig-cha. In 1935, at a place called Kotul he established the college of the Blo-gsal-glin yig_cha. Thus he gave great inpetus to studies in several monasteries. In 1937 he attained nirvana at the age of 713.

His 12-volume sumbum open with an adhyesana to his guru mkhan-chen Sans-ryas (8282 in 7f.), and after a few works there in a Tibetan translation of fa-hsien's travels to India (8295 in 50 f.) with annotations4, a summary --------------------------------------------------------------

1 Lokesh Chandra, Eminent, text p.63 2 Tobel, no 98. 3 Lkesh Chandres, Eminent, resume pp.26-27. 4 `` One of the greatest representatives of Mongolian scholar-lamas who wrote his books in Tibetan language and translated from Mongolian into Tibetan was Zava Damdin (1867-1937). Damdin is the autor of many works which are compiled in twelve volumes. Historical works occupy a very prominent place in his writings. There are about ten of then. Of these. the most outstanding one, golden Devter, deals with the history of ancient Mongolia. It is one of the best books of lod Mongolian historiography. Damdin yas a member of the Mongolean Scentific Committee. At that time it was called ``Sudar Bichgin Khuregelen''. damdin highly valued such outstanding orentalists as Academi-cian Sherbatshi and T.Aantsarano with whom he has chose scientific contact. damdin travelled a log and nor only in his own country bur twice he visited China (Peking, Wu-tai shan and Gumbum). These journeys had exceptionally great significance for his scientific activities as

@370 well as for his acquaintance with acient Chinese culture. along with the historical works of damdin, his Tibetan translation of the travels of Fa-hsien also has great scentific value, It is quite prbable that the traslation of damdin is the first and the only tibetan traslation of this most valuable source of history of Central Asia from 4th to 5th century A.D damdin's Tibetan transaltion of Fa-hsien signifies not only the great success of the translator himself but also one of the most valued works of Mongolian historical literature.. The Tibetan traslation of Fa-hsien as rendered by damdin is known as `History of Wanderings of Fa-hsien, monk of the great khan State in India, so-called magic prism, enlight-ening the whole history of teachings of the Victor [Jina]'. ...

In the intorduction, the translator writes in short about the early history of penetration of Buddhism in China and about the early India-china religious relations which were kept up by individual Buddish monk pilgrims. It is also mentioned here that the chinese original copy was found out and translated by Za-ser-pe-lins from which a Mongolian translation was rendered by a Buriat Lma translator. And damdin made his Tibetan rendering from this Mongolean translation. About his own translation he remarked that it was necessary to correct all the names and titles by comparing them with the original, as his translation was done from another translation and not from the original.

In the conclusion, given at the end of his translation, it is stated that he translated Fa- hsien's works in 1928 at Da-Khure. At the end of his translation, Damdin has proposed to the scholars to find out and translate in Tibetan language the travel notes of other well-known Chinese pilgrims like Yang-chen, Hsuan-tsang and Yi-cheng.

comparing the translation of Damdin with the manuscript copy of the Mongolian translation of Fa-hsien which is preserved at the State Library of Ulanbator, we come to the conclusion that his Tibetan translation has been rendered from this very Mongolian translation.

In this connection, we would utter a few words about the Mongolian translation, It is feel known in the scientific world, that when Dorjee Banzarov was still a student of the Kazan University, he translated from French into Mongolian, Wanderings of the 1th Century Chinese Buddhist monk by the name Ga-hsien.

In the above-mentioned manuscritpt copy of the Mongolian translation of Ga-hsien, there is no mention of the name of the transator. it has been mentioned only that it was re-written by Tsevegzav Sampil on 8 March, 1844, from the copy of Galsan Nikita lama, who leved of seven years in the University of Khiaeseki (prbably here the word `Kazanski' has been deformed. Mongolian translation of Fa-hsien, p 45 manuscript).

Here, as we have been able to make it clear with the help of Mr. Perle, the talk is about the well known Buriat schoar-Galsan Gaomboey (1822-63). It is quite probable that Damdin had Galsan Gomboev in mind when he mentioned about a Buriat-lam tranlator, who did the Mongolean rendering of Ga-jsen. but from the above statement, it is difficult to conclude that G.Gomboev is the translator of Fa-hsien. Therefore we are inclined to consider that this Mongolian translation of Ga-hsien was rendered by Dorjee Banzarov. The manuscript was re-

@371 written in 1844 and Dorjee Banzarov studied in the Jazan University from1842 to 1846. Thus the given translatin from the point of view of time factor can be fully associated with the period of student days of D.Banzarov. Probably on the the copies of D. Banzarov's translation was with G.Gomboev, which was taken from him by our copyist.

Comparing the Tibetan translation of Fa-hsien with the Mongolian translation, it is not difficult to find out that by closely following the text fo the Mongolian translation, Damdin expressed the meaning of the text very accuratly in the tibetan translation. Though the Mongolian translation is not rendered from the original text, still it is a quite accurate and good redering. And that is why Damdin's translation has turned out to be a correct and full=fledged rendering. While comparing these two reanslations with the above-mentioned English Translation by the Chinese tranlator Li Yun-hsi, we did not discover any special deflectin from the point of view of meaning, nor found any major inaccuracies, though certainly there are places where division of the text into different chapters or titles go not always coincide with the English translation. One should not forger about the above-mentioned warning sounded by Damdin himself about inaccauracies of titles and names. Actually, in a comparative study of these three translation, first of all, discrepancies in the geographical denominations or personal names hits the eye. Tibetan translatin of Damdin, as well as the Mongolian translation, have 40 chapters with corresponding titles.

In the translation of Damdin, annotations inserted between the lines of the main text rouse great interest. According to our calulation there ate about 60 such annotations in Damdin's translation. These annotations give a complete scientific character to the translation and give evidence of the wide out lood of the translator-historean, The aim of Damdin's ammotatins is mainly to specify, expain and, in some cases, to supplement the travel notes of Fa-hsien.

For the purpose of writting annotations Damdin mainly used traval nottes of the great Chinese traveller, Hsuan-tsang, sutras of prophec of Goshringa, Prophecy about the country Li (Khotan), History of Buddhism in China by Gun Gomboev and extensive narration of Zambulin (world), and essays of Mindal Nominkhan.

Main place in the annotations of Damdin has been occupied by such annotations where data of Hsuan-tsang as are contained in the History of Buddhism in China by GunGombev are compared with some data given by Fa-hsien.

In certain places, whole passages from the travel notes of Hsuan-tsang have been quoted between the lines of the translation. Let us see some of these notes of Damdin, about those that probaly these countries constituted part of GaoChan state. In this matter Damdin based his statement on the notes of Gun Gomvev about Gao-Chan. .

Most of the annotations of Damdin made on he cases of data of Hsuan-tsang, constitute comparison of travel routes of Fahsien and Hsuantsang to India.For this, Damdin very attentively followed the coincidence of the travel routes of both the travellers to India and back ot their motherland, of ten supplementing Fa-hsien form the ravel notes of Hsuan-tsangs. Eqally interesting are those annotations of Damdin based on the sutras Prophec of Goshringa and

All the annotations of Damdin relatin to the countries and cities of Eastern Turkestan are based on theres two sutras, which ate an important source of history of this patr of China and specially of the history of ancient Khotan. ... ...

From all what has been stated , it is clear that Damdi's translation, containing a large number of annotations based on releable sources, is a valuable secentific work which acquaints the readers nt only with the reabel notes of Fa-hsien but also with other writtten documents of the historry of Central Asia in general and the history of ancient India in particular.

The karchag in this vloume is from index-cards over there. As the folio-extent of the works is not available we shall take at random a few titles from every volume.

This leads to the conclusion that KA to CHA should more appropriately be termed sections of a single volume, but as they have been designated pothis we have also called them volumes, in the absence of the sumbum itself.

67.Siregetu (Tib.khri-pa) chos-rje Blo-bzan-zhi-ba was born in the Sayid cin wang-un qosiyun. Having become a pravrajita from his very childhood he got in-struction into the holy Dharma. He went to Tibet for his studies where he got admitted into the Ser-byes datsan. There he sat at the feet of many scholars like the Khalkha Jayapandita Blo-bzan-hphrin-las, heard the Dharma at length and completed his studies. Returning to his country he established a big monastery and thus furthered the stream of Dharma. Going to Urga, he heard the discourses of Jibcundampa I and of others. Returning to his monastery while he was busy in holy deeds, there came the attack of the Oirats who destroyed monastery and carried away several people including he himself. He became a servant of the Qaliyun jayisang, [chief] of the Oirts and looked after his animals. The Chief Lama told the jayisang that the old teacher had the auspicious signs of a great saint. When Blo-bzan-zhi-ba was sleeping outside the house, the jayisang saw a radiant aureole over his head. When he want to the great monastery of the Oirats the Khampo there was one of his disciples. The Khampo recognised his guru and made obeisances several times. He took the guru to his residence and while honouring him tears flowed down his eyes. Then the Khampo, kalyana-mitras, offcials and dignitaries requested an initiation into the mandala of Vajravali. Blo-bzan-zhi-ba completed the initiation from memory in the prescri-bed tradition and with perfect accuracy. The lamas and dignitaries offered him with due honour, gold and silver in daksina. Without keeping anything for himself, he distributed it to the monk-students. When the devotes enquired the reason for his not accepting anything, he said ``I am old. If all the mountains of this country were to turn into gold and the waters into butter I have no use for them. But owing to the enmity of the Jhalkhas and the Oirats, father and mother, son and daughter have been parted, causing untold miseries. How happy it would be if they could come together." Then they escorted all the people who had been brought from Khalkha along with the guru Blo-bzan-ba and their mounts, up to the boundaries of the Khalkha country. Thus the war came to an end. Returning to his country be busied himself for the Dharma and the people. Em-peror Ch'ien-lung (Tib.Lha-skyon) invited him and made him the Ta-lama of Yung-ho-kung.

By oversight R.A. Stein attributes three rituals to him when just a few lines later he himself speaks of ``2vol., 70 ouvrages dont 63 de lui-me^me''.

73. Sum-pa mkhan-po4 Ye-ses-dpal-hbyor "was born in 1704 near Dgon-lun and in his young age was known by the title of Sum-pa zabs-drun. In 1712 he was admitted as a novice in Dgon-lun, where he went through the usual curriculum of studies under the guidance of the Lcan-skya qutuytu Nag-dban-chos-ldan (1642-1714) and of the T'u-kuan qutuytu Nag-dban-chos-kyi-rgya-mtsho (1680-1714). He took his monastic vows with the former. When he was nearing the completion of his studies, disaster befell his monastery. Its community (mostly Mongols and Monguors) supported, or was implicated in, the rebellion of the qosot prince Lopsang Danjin (1723); they were dispersed and Dgon-lun yas burnt to the ground by the imperial army under Nien Keng-yao and Yueh Chung-ch'i. In the same year Sum-pa left his home country for Central Tibet, we do not know wherther before or after the destruction of Dgon-lun. He was admitted to the great monastery and center of learning of Hbras-spuns near Lhasa. In 1725 he made a journey to Bkra-sis-lhun-pa, where he pronounced his final vowa in the ______________________________________________________________ 1 Compare Obermiller, p.3n.3. 2 One of the two great colleges of the sera Monastery, the second one being ser-smad. 3 Lokesh Chandra, Eminent, resume pp.25,26; Gombojab, Tobed, no.202. 4 Gombojab, Tobed, no.21 calls him Erdeni pandita sum-pa mkhan-po.

After the ceremony he left on a pilgrimage to Lho-kha (towards the Bhutanese border) and on his way he visited the ancient royal temple of Bsam-ye-ses-grags-pa (1696-1740), who prophesied that he would one day return to his home country Amdo, as his work in favour of the religion was cut out there. In 1726, at the early age of 23, he was appointed abbot of Sgo-man, one of the four colleges into which Hbras-spuns is divided, In this position he sternly forbade his monks to take part in the civil war thar broke out after the murder of the Prime Minister khan-chen-nas on August 5th, 1727, and ended on July 3rd, 1728, with the complete victory of the Gtsan and Western Tibetan forces led by Pho-lha-nas Bsod-nams-stobs-rgyas. On this occasion Sum-pa followed rigidly the Buddhist precept againit the taking of life, which was widely disergarded by the Lamas during those troubled times. We do not know how he fared with the victor, who ruled Tibet from 1728 to 1747 with the approval and support of the Chinese. But Pho-lha nas was too clever and smooth a politician to seek useless trouble with the Church because of an action thar could not be construed as open hostility. After five years in office, in 1731 Sum-pa returned to Amdo. There he found thar Dgon-lun and the other monasteries of the region were being rebuilt, as the T'ukuan qutuytu had obtained in 1729 the imperial permission to do so, as well as considerable fnancial support; but their privileges and economic position were substantially curtailed. In 1733, along with 80 other monks, je founded the Bsad-sgrub-glin monastery, with a branch institution at the hermitage of Bsam-gtan-glin (comtaning 15 monks). In 1737, being summoned by the Ch'ien-lung emperor (1735-1796). he travelled to Peking in the compay of the Lcan-skya qutuytu Rol-pahi-rdo-rje (1717-1786). He was granted titles and favours by the emperor, but refused (at least on that occasion) the rank of an incarnated lama (Tib.sprul-sku, Mong.qutuytu). He stayed five years in Peking as a sort of assistant to the young Lcan-skya qutuytu, who was a real favourite of the emperor. By his order he revised the Tibetan books printed in China, which are among the best Tibetan editons ever published. At the end of this period he was granted the title of Erdeni Pandita. In 1743 he retired to the sacred mountain of Wu-t'-shan in Shensi, where he stayed for three years. In 1746 he finally returned to Amdo, being appointed to the abbatial see of Dgon-lun. It was the crowing of his ecclesiastical career, and henceforward he dedicated himself completely to his duties and to his multifarious writting acticites. The Dpag-bsam-ljon-bzan was compiled in 1748 and his biography gives a rather vague list of works on astrology, medicine, iconometry, history,

After a long introduction the karchag gives an explanatory list of all the titles, which affords an idea abour the contents of every work. The volumes are indicated by ordinal numbers (dan-po,..,brgyad-pa). This part of the karchag may be termed in the author himself, tho-yig (folil 5a line 6 : Btsal sla-ched-du tho-yig hgod-paho). On folio 8a line 4 begins a synoptic list which the author has termed ka-tho (gnis-pa btsal slahi-ched-du ka-tho bkod-pa ni). In contradistinction to the former list, it indicates the volumes by the well-known method of KA, KHA, etc. surperposed with the usual ornamental Tibetan braces. This accounts for its being designated as ka-tho. There are two supplememtary volumes which have slips with the designation bskyed-rim and lhan-thabs. Both of them seem to be later additons. They are not included in the karchag, in which the ka-tho clearly says on folio 9a that there are eight volumes : kar-chag bcas- pa-ste brgyad-do. Moreover, both have a chinese marginal signature which is not regularly. so also the right-hand side has irregulat page-numbers in chinese. In the first eight volumes there is no chinese charcter, neither as a marginal title nor as a page-number. The ninth volume (bskyed-rim) is an utpattikrama of Mahavajrabhairava (10345 in 125f.) aud the tenth (lhan-thabs 'supplement') is a commentary on the various chapters of the fundamental medical classic Rgyud-bzhi, submarked ka-tsa (10346-373), followed by a shor examination of houses according to the Indian method (10374 in 5 f.).

78. Ilayuysan qutuytu Arthasidha2 is the popular name of Blo-bzan-bsam-grub. He is more fully called Arthasidhavajra in the title of his biography (10024) and by Gombojab3. The duality of names has led to the repetition of the karchag of the first volume of his sumbum is this section from the cards of the State Library of Ulanbator. His complete writtings and biographic sketch are detailed above in 70. It is instructive to compare the two to see how the index cards of the State Labrary at Ulanbator have shortened the title to an indicative minimum.

I hope that this karchag of Mongolian sumbums will provide a valuable tool for comprehending the literary heritage of the Mongolian peoples and impart an interdisciplinary breadth to Mongolistics. It was inspired by my father Prof.Dr.Raghu Vira who is no more amidst us today. He would have loved to read it through. Alas! that privilege of mine was never to be. His affection inspires me to carry to completion his immense cultural project of the satapitaka and there in lies my consolution and fortitude. LOKESH CHANDRA
