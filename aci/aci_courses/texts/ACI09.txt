The Asian Classics Institute
Course IX: The Ethical Life
Reading One: Je Tsongkapa's Epistle on Ethics
The reading for this class consists of the entire text of Je Tsongkapa's Epistle to
Ngawang Drakpa on the Occasion of the Ordination of the First Monks of Gyalrong.
Master Ngawang Drakpa, also known as Tsako Wonpo ("the friar of the lineage
of the Kings of Tsako"), was one of Je Tsongkapa's closest disciples. After he
had trained him in the Dharma, Je Tsongkapa sent Ngawang Drakpa to a
distant region in east Tibet, entrusted with the mission of establishing a
number of monasteries and training Buddhist monks.
The ensuing correspondence between the teacher and his faraway disciple has
provided us with several true classics of Buddhist thought, including the
following demonstration of the role of an ethical life in developing one's ability
to meditate and perceive emptiness. Another letter from Je Tsongkapa to
Ngawang Drakpa during this period contains the famous Three Principal Paths,
which along with the commentary of Pabongka Rinpoche has been translated
in the book The Principal Teachings of Buddhism. The introduction to this book
also contains more detail on Master Ngawang Drakpa's life, and his close
relationship to Je Tsongkapa.
Please note that the version of the letter available for translation contained a
number of printing errors that have been corrected to the best of our ability;
we hope to obtain another edition later for comparison.

The entire teachings of the Victors reside
in the three collections of scripture;
Thus the essence of what they have taught
can be found within the three trainings.
The very first one of all these three
is training in an ethical life,
And its home the Buddhas have spoken to be
the teachings on discipline.

This too is why so much of the Dharma,

Has by the Buddhas been devoted
to the way of discipline.
It explains as well why all those masters
who understand the order
Of subjects to learn all take delight
in the teachings on discipline.

The training on perfect concentration,
quietude, must come
Before one can ever the develop the one

on wisdom, the ultimate vision.
Only a trace of this truth can be heard
anymore, and not a peep
On the fact that good concentration can't come
without first training in ethics.

Some people find only the courage to pledge
themselves in word to this training,
Then later discard their commitments like trash;
they are lowest in a world of low.
The way of the holy is different; they make
every conceivable effort
In keeping whatever ethical rules
they may have committed to.

Once you have realized this fact
you must rely on watchfulness
And awareness; constantly checking all three
of the gateways for any wrong deeds,
Depending as well on a sense of care
and propriety to control
With all your strength the wild horse
of the senses, seeking to keep
This steed from taking you to a path
that leads you all astray.
With this state of mind you'll be able to hold
your concentration perfectly
Fixed on any virtuous object
at your heart's content.
Thus is the ethical life commended
for perfect concentration.

This state of mind is totally free
of the dirt of broken morality,
And is never disturbed or distracted from
the object of goodness you choose;
Therefore suchness, the lack of a self,
is perfectly clear to it,
Just like the moon's reflection on water
undisturbed and crystal clear.

A perfect understanding of all of the
essential points like these

depends precisely upon
An understanding of all the three
collections of Buddhist scripture;
Thus you should take yourself to a master
and train in the three collections.

I have written the above lines as just a very brief presentation of the reasons
why an ethical way of life is the very basis of the Buddhist path. As such I
hope that you will cherish them, and review them again and again. I am

extremely pleased by the fact that you have been able to ordain so many
individuals, and give so many teachings on discipline, there in what from a
Buddhist point of view is a wild and barbarian land.

If one focusses primarily on the taking of vows, and then fails in the practical
aspects of keeping them seriously and restoring them when they are damaged,
then there is absolutely no way that one's practice of the ethical way of life can
be pure. As such it is essential that you now go on to help your new monks
keep their vows well by learning to identify what constitutes breaking them.
So too you must institute a regular practice of purification and restoration,
whereby the monks learn to confess past errors and restrain themselves from
future error, in the event that--because of one of the four factors, such as not
understanding the vows properly--they should ever transgress them. They
must learn never to take it lightly when they break a vow; they must be taught
the proper methods of restoring vows in every instance where they are broken.
In this way, and through developing a sense of shame and propriety, as well
as watchfulness, awareness, and similar tools, they will come to lead a
perfectly ethical way of life.

From an overall point of view, the Buddhas have described certain benefits that
derive from virtuous deeds, and serious problems that derive from non-
virtuous deeds. We tend to think of the benefits as something that has no
relevance until we are lying on our deathbed. And we view the descriptions
of the problems as though they were some kind of veiled threat. We should
rather try to develop, in the very depths of our hearts, the recognition that they
are absolutely true.
In a more specific sense, we must meditate extensively upon the benefits of
maintaining an ethical way of life, and upon the serious problems of failing to
maintain such a code. This will bring us to a full recognition of their truth.
Should we fail to do so, and if keeping up this ethical way of life becomes for
us something motivated only by a concern about how we look to others, or
about the honor and gifts we might obtain thereby, then the real point of ethics
is lost.

The obstacle that prevents us from leading an ethical way of life for the right
reasons is our enthusiasm for the activities of our present rebirth. And this in
turn comes from viewing our present life as though it were a place where we
are going to be spending some substantial amount of time. The most profound
cure for this way of thinking is to maintain, on many levels, an awareness of
our coming death. As such it is absolutely essential that you meditate, again
and again, on the fact that you will die.

In a nutshell, the ability to perceive in detail the infallible workings of the
deeds we do and the consequences we reap is a quality which is unique to
beings who are omniscient. As such we must refer constantly to such
scriptures as the Sutra on Awareness, the Hundred Deeds, the Hundred Stories of
Past Lives, the Sutra on the Wise and Foolish, the Accounts of Scripture, and a wide
variety of other sutras and classical commentaries.
By doing so we can make our recognition of the laws of karma and its
consequences ever more firm. We must purify the bad karma we have
collected in the past, until we reach the point where we are sure it has been
erased. We must restrain ourselves from engaging in any new bad karma,
until we reach the point where we are sure we have discontinued this behavior
completely.
We must take the good karma we have been able to accomplish so far, and
multiply its power through highly effective kinds of prayer. We must look at
the good karma we have not yet been able to accomplish, and make it happen,
not through any limited kinds of activity, but rather through a whole variety
of different means.

Whatever of the above we may be able to carry out, it will all be infinitely
more effective if we can learn to do it while keeping our minds soaked in the
wish for enlightenment, whether in its full form, or even just in some partial
form.
Remember too that the victorious Buddhas have recommended in countless
open and secret scriptures that we seek the correct view of emptiness, the one
that absolutely destroys every tendency to grasp to indications as objects
themselves. This then allows us to avoid the two extremes of thinking either
that things exist independently, or that--if they don't exist
independently--they cannot exist at all.
A well-founded grasp of the laws of karma and its consequences complements
correct view; the very activity of being extremely careful to do the right thing
in the arena of good and bad deeds, down to the smallest detail of our lives,
gives us the ability to eliminate in ourselves entirely the two extremes of
thinking "everything exists" and "nothing can exist."

The vast majority of beings fall into one of two traps. Some have a
misconception about things that are in nature empty which would necessitate
their being unchanging. Others have a misconception which would obviate the

entire way in which deceptive reality exists; which would necessitate the end
of these very objects.
The actual truth therefore is extremely difficult to perceive, and even among
those who have the capacity to do so there are infinitely few who could ever
become a vessel worthy to receive the teachings. Therefore anyone who has
any hope of seeing these things must first address the causes that would bring
it about; they must accumulate the power of good deeds and purify their bad
deeds, and make a great many holy prayers. They must take themselves
properly to a spiritual guide who is a master of these things, and acquaint
themselves well with the scriptures that describe them. Finally they must seek
the truth by using their intellect to examine closely every point, and never be
satisfied with only a rough or incomplete understanding.

that had never been done before. The reply itself was composed by the
glorious monk Lobsang Drakpa [Je Tsongkapa], and dispatched from his place
of retreat named Teura, near the place called Eisa. May goodness ever
increase!

Now the revered King of the Dharma, the great Tsongkapa of the East, the one
known as the glorious Lobsang Drakpa, renowned throughout the three lands,
once composed a summary of the vows of individual freedom. This is the text
entitled the Shorter Essence of the Ocean of Discipline. My explanation of this
work has three divisions: the preliminaries, the actual explanation, and the
conclusion. The preliminaries themselves have three parts: the benediction, the
eulogy and prostration, and the pledge to compose the work.
THE BENEDICTION

DANG PO NI, AOM BDE LEGS SU GYUR CIG, CES PAS STON LA,
The benediction is expressed in the first line of the text:
Om! May there be happiness and goodness.

DON NI, AOM YIG GIS RGYAL BA RNAMS KYI SKU GSUNG THUGS KYI GSANG BA GSUM MTSON ZHING , MTSON DON DE DRAN PA'I SGO NAS GSANG BA GSUM DANG LDAN PA'I RGYAL BA SRAS BCAS RNAMS LA MKHYEN PAR GSOL TE, 'GRO BA RNAMS KYIS GNAS SKABS LHA MI'I BDE BA DANG , MTHAR THUG NGES LEGS THAR PA DANG , THAMS CAD MKHYEN PA'I LAM DU ZHUGS NAS RGYAL BA RNAMS LA JI LTAR MNGA' BA'I GSANG GSUM GYI GO 'PHANG THOB PAR GYUR CIG CES PA'O,
The meaning of this line is as follows. The syllable om symbolizes the three
mysteries--the exalted body, speech, and mind of the victorious Buddhas. As
we intone this syllable, we bear in mind the beings that it represents. These are
the victorious Buddhas--possessors of the three mysteries--along with their
sons and daughters. And it is to them that we are making our supplication:
May all living beings enter the path that leads to the transitory happiness
of humans and pleasure beings, or to the ultimate goodness of freedom
and omniscience. Then may they reach the state where they possess
these three mysteries, exactly as the victorious Buddhas do.
THE EULOGY AND PROSTRATION

,GNYIS PA NI, THAMS CAD MKHYEN PA LA PHYAG 'TSAL LO,
The eulogy and prostration are expressed in the next line of the text:
I bow down to the Omniscient One.

,ZHES PAS STON LA, DON NI, RJE BLA MAS GDUL BYA'I DON DU BSTAN BCOS 'DI RTZOM PA'I THOG MAR, GDUL BYA RNAMS KYIS SANGS RGYAS KYI CHE BA SHES PA DANG , RANG GI BSOD NAMS KYI TSOGS 'PHEL BA DANG , DAM PA RNAMS KYI SPYOD PA DANG MTHUN PA SOGS DANG , LHAG PAR SNGON GYI BKAS BCAD DANG MTHUN PA'I PHYIR DU BDAG CAG GI STON PA'I THUN MONG MA YIN PA'I YON TAN DRAN PA'I DAD GUS CHEN POS, SKU'I BA SPU LDANG ZHING PHYAG THAL MO SBYAR BA DBUR BZHAG STE, LAS 'BRAS PHRA MO SOGS SHES BYA THAMS CAD MNGON SUM DU MKHYEN PA'I SANGS RGYAS BCOM LDAN 'DAS LA PHYAG 'TSAL LO STE SGO GSUM DVANG BAS 'DUD DO ZHES PA'O, ,
Our Lord Lama, at the outset of his treatise, makes a prostration for the benefit
of his disciples. He does so for a number of reasons: to help his disciples
understand the greatness of the Buddha, to increase his own accumulation of
merit, to emulate the holy ones, and so on. Most especially, he wishes to
conform with the decree of old. He makes his prostrations with great faith and

reverence, turning his thoughts to the unique virtues of our Teacher. Hair
standing on end, he joins his palms devotedly atop his head. He bends down,
bowing himself to the Omniscient One--to the Buddha, the Transcendent Victor,
who directly perceives all knowable things, including even the most subtle
workings of actions and their consequences. Je Tsongkapa expresses his
obeisance in his words, thoughts, and deeds, with crystalline admiration.
THE PLEDGE TO COMPOSE THE WORK

`, GSUM PA LA GNYIS, 'DUL BA'I CHE BA BRJOD PA DANG , RTZOM PAR DAM BCA' BA'I SGO NAS LUS MDOR BSTAN PA'O, , DANG PO NI,
The third preliminary, the pledge to compose the work, has two sections:
extolling the greatness of the code of discipline, and summarizing the entire
body of the text in the pledge itself. The first of these is contained in the first
verse of the root text:

,GANG LA BRTEN NA BDE BLAG TU,
,THAR PA'I GRONG DU BGROD PA'I THABS,
,BDE GSHEGS BSTAN PA'I SNYING PO 
MCHOG,SO SOR THAR CES GRAGS PA GANG ,
There is something which, if you rely on it,
Is the way to travel with ease to the city of freedom;
The supreme essence of the teachings of those Gone to Bliss:
It is that which is called "individual freedom."

ZHES PAS STON LA, DON NI, BSTAN PA'I RTZA BA SO SOR THAR PA DANG DE BRJOD BYAR STON PA'I 'DUL BA GANG LA BRTEN CING SO THAR GYI SDOM PA BLANGS NAS TSUL BZHIN DU BSRUNGS NA DKA' LAS CHER MED PAR BDE BLAG TU MTHO RIS DANG , THAR PA DANG , THAMS CAD MKHYEN PA'I GRONG KHYER DU BGROD PAR BYED PA'I THEM SKAS SAM THABS, BDE BAR

The "something" in the root text refers to the very root of the Buddha's
teachings; that is, to the vows of individual freedom and the books on the code
of discipline which take these vows as their subject matter. Suppose you rely
on this: you take these vows of individual freedom, and you keep them well.
This then is the way, the staircase, for traveling with ease (without any great
difficulty) up to the city of the higher realms, freedom, and omniscience.
This "something" is also the supreme essence (snying-po) of the teachings of the
Buddhas (those who have "Gone to Bliss"), the very lifeblood (snying) that
allows these teachings to survive in our world.
This "something," that which we call the "vows of individual freedom," is so
named because those individuals who take and then keep them properly will
escape the cycle of suffering, whereas those who don't, will not.

`, GNYIS PA NI,
The second section, where the entire body of the text is presented briefly
through a pledge to compose the work, is contained in the next verse of the
root text:

,NGO BO DANG NI RAB DBYE DANG ,
,SO SO'I NGOS 'DZIN SKYE BA'I RTEN,
,GTONG BA'I RGYU DANG PHAN YON TE,
,RNAM PA DRUG GIS JI BZHIN BSHAD,
In keeping, I shall explain them in six categories:
Their basic nature, the way they are divided,
Their individual descriptions, who can take them,
How they are lost, and the benefits they give.

CES PAS STON LA, DON NI, GONG DU SMOS PA'I SO THAR GYI SDOM PA DE NI 'DIR SO THAR GYI SDOM PA'I NGO BO DANG NI, SO THAR GYI SDOM PA'I RAB DBYE DANG , SO THAR RIS BRGYAD KYI SDOM PA SO SO'I NGOS 'DZIN DANG , SO THAR GYI SDOM PA SKYE BA'I RTEN DANG , SO THAR GYI SDOM PA GTONG BA'I RGYU DANG , SO THAR GYI SDOM PA BSRUNGS PA'I PHAN YON TE DON TSAN RNAM PA DRUG GIS NI, RGYAL BA'I DGONGS PA JI LTA BA BZHIN DU BSHAD PAR BYA'O ZHES PA'O,
Je Tsongkapa is saying that he is going to explain the vows of individual
freedom, which he only touched upon above, in keeping with the true intent of
the victorious Buddhas. He is going to do so in six categories: their basic nature,
the way they are divided into eight types, their individual descriptions, who can take
them, how they are lost, and the benefits they give when you keep them properly.
II. THE ACTUAL EXPLANATION

`, GNYIS PA BSHAD PA NYID NYE BAR DGOD PA LA DRUG, SO THAR GYI SDOM PA'I NGO BO BSHAD PA, SO THAR GYI SDOM PA'I RAB DBYE BSHAD PA, SO THAR RIS BRGYAD KYI SDOM PA SO SO'I NGOS 'DZIN BSHAD PA, SO THAR GYI SDOM PA SKYE BA'I RTEN BSHAD PA, SO THAR GYI SDOM PA GTONG BA'I RGYU BSHAD PA, SO THAR GYI SDOM PA BSRUNGS PA'I PHAN YON BSHAD PA'O,
My explanation of the text itself will follow these same six categories: their
basic nature, the way they are divided into eight types, their individual
descriptions, who can take them, how they are lost, and the benefits they give
when you keep them properly.
THE BASIC NATURE OF THE VOWS

,DANG PO LA GNYIS, SO THAR GYI SDOM PA'I NGO BO NGOS BZUNG BA DANG , NGO BO DE GZUGS SEMS GANG DU 'JOG GI RANG SDE'I BZHED TSUL LO,
This category has two parts: an identification of the basic nature of the vows
of individual freedom, and the positions of different Buddhist schools as to
whether their basic nature is physical or mental.

DANG PO NI,
The identification of the basic nature of the vows is covered in the following
lines of the root text:

,NGES 'BYUNG BSAM PAS RGYU BYAS NAS,
,GZHAN GNOD GZHI DANG BCAS PA LAS,
,LDOG PA   
It is a turning away from harming others,
And its basis, caused by an attitude
Of renunciation...

ZHES PAS STON LA, DON NI, GZHAN GYI LAD MO DANG G-YAM LA RGYUG TZAM MA YIN PAR 'KHOR BA MTHA' DAG LA ZHEN PA GTING NAS LOG STE YID NGES PAR 'BYUNG BA'I BSAM PAS RGYU BYAS PA STE KUN NAS BSLANGS TE, BLA MA'I SPYAN SNGAR GZHAN LA GNOD PA LUS NGAG GI MI DGE BA BDUN DANG , BDUN PO DE'I GZHI YID KYI MI DGE BA GSUM MAM BCAS PA'I KHA NA MA THO BA DANG BCAS PA LAS LDOG PAR KHAS BLANGS SHING DAM BCAS PA'I SDOM PA DE SO THAR GYI SDOM PA'I NGO BO'I ZHES PA'O,
Here Je Tsongkapa is saying that one's commitment to these vows should be
caused by--that is, motivated by--an attitude where one feels a deep disgust for
every single inch of the cycle of suffering life, and has thus decided to renounce
it. You should not take the vows simply because you are imitating someone
else, or just following the crowd.
The basic nature of the vows then is as follows. In the presence of your Lama,
you agree and pledge yourself to turn away from harming others; you agree to
refrain from the seven physical and verbal deeds which are wrong by nature,
and to avoid their basis as well. Here the word "basis" refers either to the three

mental bad deeds that act as a foundation for the seven, or else to those bad
deeds which were prohibited by Lord Buddha.

`, GNYIS PA NI,
The positions of different Buddhist schools as to whether their basic nature are
physical or mental is expressed in these lines:

   DE YANG LUS NGAG LAS,
,GZUGS CAN YIN ZHES 'DOD PA DANG ,
,SPONG BA'I SEMS PA RGYUN CHAGS PA,
,SA BON DANG BCAS YIN NO ZHES,
,'DOD PA'I TSUL NI RNAM PA GNYIS,
,RANG GI SDE PA GONG 'OG SMRA,
...It is physical and verbal karma
Which they assert is physical matter.
The others say it is the intention to give up
And its seed as it continues in your mind.
Thus our schools' positions are two:
What the higher and lower assert.

ZHES PAS STON LA, DON NI, DE YANG SO THAR GYI SDOM PA'I NGO BO LUS NGAG GI LAS DE BYE BRAG SMRA BA RNAMS KYIS BSTAN MED THOGS MED KYI GZUGS CAN DANG , DBU MA THAL 'GYUR BA RNAMS KYIS CHOS KYI SKYE MCHED KYI GZUGS CAN YIN NO ZHES 'DOD PA DANG , MDO SDE PA SEMS TZAM PA DBU MA RANG RGYUD PA RNAMS KYIS SPONG BA'I SEMS PA RGYUN CHAGS PA SA BON DANG BCAS PA YIN NO ZHES 'DOD PA'I TSUL MI 'DRA BA NI RNAM PA GNYIS RANG GI PHYOGS NANG PA SANGS RGYAS PA'I SDE PA STE GRUB MTHA' GONG 'OG RNAMS SMRA

It, meaning the basic nature of the individual freedom vows, is physical and
verbal karma. According to the Abhidharma School this karma is a kind of
invisible and ineffable physical matter. The Consequence section of the Middle
Way School also assert that it is physical matter, but they say that it is physical
matter belonging to the gateway of phenomena. The others--meaning the
Sutrists, the Mind-Only School, and the Independent Section of the Middle-
Way School--say that it is the continued intention to give up [bad deeds], along
with the seed of this intention. Thus this verse explains that even in our own
Buddhist schools, two dissimilar positions are asserted on this point in the tenets
of the higher and lower schools.
The "invisible and ineffable form" mentioned above is explained as follows.
In the first moment that the vows are taken, they consist of form which
communicates the intent of the person taking the vows. After that moment
they become a type of form which does not communicate this intent.
On the other hand the "intention to give up [the bad deeds]" is explained as
being mental, and "its seed" is explained as being a changing thing which is
neither mental nor physical. These then are the two viewpoints.
THE DIVISIONS OF THE VOWS

DANG , SO THAR GYI SDOM PA'I BSDU BA'O, ,
My explanation of the divisions of the individual freedom vows will have two
sections: the actual division of individual freedom vows into categories, and
a grouping of the vows.

`, DANG PO NI,
The actual divisions of the individual freedom vows are shown in these lines:

,BSNYEN GNAS DGE BSNYEN PHA MA DANG,
,DGE TSUL PHA MA DGE SLONG MA,
,DGE SLONG MA DANG DGE SLONG STE,
,SO SOR THAR PA RIS BRGYAD DO,
Staying close, close to virtue.
Way to virtue, versed in virtue,
And begging for virtue. These are
The eight kinds of individual freedom.

ZHES PAS STON LA, DON NI, THAR PA'I GO 'PHANG DANG BSNYEN PA STE NYE BAR GNAS PAR BYED PAS NA BSNYEN GNAS KYI SDOM PA DANG , DGE BA MYANG 'DAS LA BSNYEN PA STE NYE BAR BYED PAS NA DGE BSNYEN PHA'I SDOM PA DANG , DGE BSNYEN MA'I SDOM PA DANG , DGE BA MYANG 'DAS KYI TSUL TE LAM DU ZHUGS PAS NA DGE TSUL PHA'I SDOM PA DANG , DGE TSUL MA'I SDOM PA DANG , DGE SLONG MA'I SDOM PA BSRUNG NUS THABS SU SPANG BYA BCU GNYIS LA SLOB PAS NA DGE SLONG MA'I SDOM PA DANG , DGE BA MYANG 'DAS KYI GO 'PHANG SLONG BA STE 'TSOL BAS NA DGE SLONG MA'I SDOM PA DANG , DGE SLONG PHA'I SDOM PA STE, SO SOR THAR PA'I SDOM PA LA DBYE NA RIS BRGYAD YOD DO ZHES PA'O, ,
The one-day vows are called "staying close" because they help you stay close
to nirvana in the sense of taking you there. The lifetime vows for laymen and
laywomen are called "close to virtue" because they help you be close to virtue,
which here refers to nirvana. The vows of male novices and female novices
are called "way to virtue" because those who possess these vows have entered
the way, that is the path, which leads to virtue, again referring to nirvana. The
vows of an intermediate nun are called "versed in virtue" because these women

are versing themselves in the twelve rules, in order to be able to keep the vows
of a fully ordained nun. Fully ordained monks and fully ordained nuns are
called "begging for virtue" because they are begging, that is seeking, that state
of virtue: nirvana. In this verse Je Tsongkapa is thus listing the eight kinds of
individual freedom vows.

The grouping of the vows is given here:

The last five vows for the ordained.

Moreover, the eight classes of individual freedom vows mentioned above can
be grouped according to who can take them. Here there are two broad groups:
the vows which relate to laypeople, and the vows which relate to ordained

people. The kinds of vows which relate to laypeople are the first three: one-day
vows, the layman's lifetime vows, and laywoman's lifetime vows. The kind of
vows which relate to those who are ordained are the last five: the vows of male
novices, female novices, intermediate nuns, fully ordained nuns, and fully
ordained monks.

subsume six sections: an identification of the one-day vows; the layperson's
lifetime vows; the novice vows; the vows of an intermediate nun; the vows of
a fully ordained nun; and the vows of a fully ordained monk.
One-Day Vows

The first section, the explanation of the one-day vows, has two points: an
identification of what the one-day vow is, and an outline of the eight
components which you agree to give up.
These lines of the root text identify the vow:

,RTZA BA BZHI DANG YAN LAG BZHI,
,BRGYAD SPONG BSNYEN GNAS SDOM PA'O,
The one-day vow is to give up eight:
The root four and the secondary four.

The one-day vow is to agree to give up, for the length of a single twenty-four
hour period, the eight components to be abandoned: sexual activity and the rest
of the root four components, as well as the use of high or valuable seats, along
with the rest of the secondary four components. This vow can be taken from
someone who has already taken the one-day vow, and who holds either the
lifetime vow of a layperson, or any higher freedom vow.

The root four are sexual activity, stealing something of value, killing a human or
a human fetus, and speaking lies about your spiritual realizations. The secondary
four are (1) making use of a seat or bed which is valuable in that it incorporates
jewels or some other precious substance, or else which is higher than a cubit;
(2) drinking alcohol or any brewed or concocted substance which causes an
intoxicated state; (3) dancing and "so on," which refers to singing and playing
music, or else ornamenting yourself and "such"--that is, wearing jewelry or
makeup; and finally (4) eating food after noon.
Lifetime Vows of a Layperson

The explanation of the lifetime vows of a layperson contains two points: the
actual identification of these vows, and an explanation of the different
categories of the vow.

Here first is the identification of the vows:

,GSOD RKU SMRA DANG LOG PAR G-YEM,
,MYOS 'GYUR 'THUNG BA LNGA SPONG BA,

The lifetime layperson's vow is to give up
The five of killing, stealing, and lying,
Adultery, and drinking intoxicants.

The procedure for taking the lifetime vows of a layperson is as follows. In the
presence of a preceptor who holds at least these same vows, you begin with
formally taking refuge. You next pledge that, for the length of your entire life,
you will give up breaking the five basic rules, and avoid as well those actions
which are inconsistent with the advices on going for refuge. The five rules
here are to give up killing a human or human fetus; stealing anything of
significant value (that is, anything worth more than a quarter of a karshapana
[somewhere between an American quarter and a dollar]); lying about your
spiritual attainments; committing adultery by having sexual relations with
someone else's spouse; and drinking alcohol, or any substance which makes you
intoxicated.

`, GNYIS PA NI,
The different categories of lifetime layperson's vows are presented in the

Keeping one of them, a couple, most,
And keeping all; keeping celibacy,
And a refuge layperson: these are the six.
These consist respectively of agreeing
To give up one, two, or three of the root four;
To give up adultery and all sexual activity,
And to keep just the lay vow of going for refuge.

There are six different categories of people who have lifetime layperson's vows:
laypeople who are keeping only one component, those who are keeping a couple
of them, those who are keeping most of them, those who are keeping all of them,
those who are keeping celibacy, and lastly those called "refuge laypeople" who
are keeping only a vow of refuge.
These six categories of laypeople's vows consist respectively of agreeing to the six
things which are listed after them in the root text. The first category of
laypeople have agreed to give up killing humans or any other one of the root
four. The second category of laypeople have given up two of the root four, and
the third have given up three of them. The fourth category of laypeople are
those who have agreed to give up breaking all five of the basic rules, which
includes not committing adultery. The fifth category consists of those who have
additionally agreed to give up all sexual activity. The sixth kind of laypeople
have agreed to keep just the lay vow of going for refuge to the Three Jewels.
Everyone with lifetime layperson's vows must give up alcohol and keep the
advices on taking refuge.

The Commentary on the Eight Lifetime Layperson's Vows and the Jewel of the True
Thought of the Able Ones mention another kind of lifetime layperson called a
"gomi" layperson. The word gomi means "venerable"; according to Tsonawa,
this is a vow which is recognized in the system of the Majority School, and
refers to those who wear the robes of an ordained or "venerable" person, and
who take the one-day vows every day for as long as they live. In this text our
precious Lord does not mention this vow explicitly, probably because it is not
included in the system of the Entirist School. The reverend Lobsang Palden
Yeshe says that the great translator Gu mentions a kind of "higher" layperson.
This should be investigated at some future time.

The third section on the vows of a novice will have two points: an
identification of the novice vows, and a description of the novice's rules.

The identification of the novice vow is expressed in these lines:

The novice vow is agreeing to give up, for as long as you live, ten different things
to be abandoned: the root four of killing and the rest, and the secondary six of
dancing and so on. The vow must be taken with a motivation of renunciation,
in the presence of a preceptor, a ceremonial assistant, and a quorum of
ordained people.

`, GNYIS PA NI,
The description of the novice vows is given in the following verse:

The secondary come to six, by dividing into two
Dancing and so on, and ornamentation and such,
and then adding handling money to make three.

The secondary vows come to six, in the following way. We first divide into two
the vow of giving up dancing and so on, and ornamentation and such. Then we
add the rule about not handling money, and this makes three. If on top of these
we add the three that concern drinking alcohol, eating food after noon, and
using high valuable seats, the total is six.
By adding these to the root four that prohibit killing, stealing, sexual activity,
and lying, we come to ten main things which must be given up. (Je Tsongkapa
does not explicitly mention certain of the secondary six, nor the root four, at
this point in his text because he already covered them in the section on the
one-day vow.)
Over and above these ten we add the three failures of not making supplications to
your preceptor, not giving up the appearance of a layperson, and not taking on the
appearance of the ordained; we thus arrive at a total of thirteen. The vow of a
novice is to give up these thirteen, which are known as "transgressions of the
vow taken directly from the preceptor."

The vows of an intermediate nun are taken subsequent to receiving a pure form
of the female novice vows explained earlier. They must be taken with a
motivation of renunciation, from a female preceptor and a female master of
ceremony before a quorum of the ordained.
These intermediate nun's vows consist of agreeing to give up twelve things for the
length of two years. Here first are six basic--that is, elemental--parts or actions
to give up, such as walking down a street without a proper companion. Next
are the six ancillary or incidental parts, such as taking possession of money.

One agrees to give up the above downfalls, and pledges to adhere to this code
of behavior for the length of one's entire life. This is done through a ceremony
involving four different requests, in the presence of a [female] preceptor, a
[female] master of ceremony, and two groups of the ordained, each
constituting the necessary quorum. One takes the vows out of a motivation of
renunciation.

The vows of a full monk are or consist of giving up two hundred and fifty-three
different things, or observing a code of this many rules. The things that you
give up consist of the sum total of the following groups:
(. . .)
One agrees to give up the above downfalls, and pledges to adhere to this code
of behavior for the length of one's entire life. This is done through a full
ordination ceremony of current times which is complete and without fault,
performed in the presence of a preceptor, a master of ceremony, and a quorum
of the ordained. One takes the vows out of a motivation of renunciation.

Here finally is a literal explanation of the names of the different offenses and
downfalls. The word "root" is used to describe those ultimate wrong actions
which function to damage one's vows. "Defeats" are so named because, in
committing them, one has been defeated by the enemy; that is, by mental
afflictions and the things they involve. "Remainders" take their name from the
fact that, if you perform one of them, there is nonetheless the slightest bit of
a vow remaining that can be restored.
"Downfalls of release" are spoken of this way because, in order to repair them,
one must first release some object. "Downfalls" are so called because they
make a person who commits them fall down into the lower births. "Deeds for
individual confession" are types of wrong actions that must be confessed by
each full monk individually first. "Offenses" or bad deeds are so called
because one has done something which was not good. "Obstacles" take their
name from the fact that they present an obstacle to the further development of
one's good qualities.
"Non-virtues" [literally "deeds that we are threatened against"] derive their
name from the fact that they give unpleasant consequences. "Wrong deeds"
[literally "unspeakable acts"] are so called because they are actions which in the
presence of holy beings we would feel unable to admit we had done.

Those eight types of individual freedom vows which I explained above can be taken
by people, male or female, who live on the three continents of Dzambu, Greatbody
and Cattleusers, but not by those who live on the northern continent of Terrible
Sound, or on one of the two subcontinents related to this continent. The vows
cannot be taken by the following types of beings:
those who are impotent in the sense of being unable to have sexual
relations;
neuters, which includes five kinds of "male" neuters (neuters from birth,
half-month neuters, contact neuters, jealousy neuters, and neuters by
castration)1
and five kinds of "female" neuters (hermaphroditic neuters,

These five types of "female" neuters are explained as follows. An "hermaphroditic neuter" is a
predominately female hermaphrodite with both male and female sexual organs. A "neuter by
connection" is a woman suffering from a disease where the sexual organ and anus are interconnected.
A "neuter who is always menstruating" refers to a woman who is constantly menstruating. A "neuter
who never menstruates" is a woman who is not menstruating at all. An "infertile neuter" is a woman
who has the female sexual organ but not the female sexual energy.
51
neuters by connection, neuters who are always menstruating, neuters
who never menstruate, and infertile neuters);2
as well as hermaphrodites, who possess both male and female sexual
organs.
Neither can vows be taken by persons who have committed an immediate
misdeed, by those who are impostors attempting to learn about the tradition
for their own reasons, by persons who hold wrong views, or anyone of the like.

two sections: the actual explanation of what makes you lose your vows, and
an explanation of the beliefs of our own Buddhist schools concerning this.

The first of these has two parts of its own: an explanation of the "shared"
causes which would make you lose any of the eight types of individual-
freedom vows, and then an explanation of the unique causes which would
make you lose certain ones of these vows.

The first of the two is covered in the following lines of the root text:

The causes for losing your vows are two.

Both organs appearing, changing three times,
And cutting the very root of virtue.

The two causes for losing your vows are the shared causes for losing any of the
eight types of individual freedom vows, and the unique causes for losing
certain ones of them. The shared causes for losing any of the vows are the
following:
returning your vows by pronouncing the words of the ritual for
returning them, where you say "I give back my vows..." and so on in the
presence of a fully-ordained monk or the like;
dying and moving on to your next birth;
having both male and female sexual organs appear on you
simultaneously;
changing sexes three times;

or cutting the very root of your virtue by holding wrong views.

`, GNYIS PA NI,
The unique causes for losing certain ones of the vows are explained in these
lines:

The unique causes for losing the vows of a fully-ordained monk, an intermediate
nun, and a one-day vow are, respectively, the following three:
not being twenty years old when you took full monk's vows, but
thinking you were as you did, and then later finding out that you weren't
twenty, while you're still not twenty (here the time spent in the womb is
included in the twenty);
agreeing to have sex with a man;

and the ending of a day (that is, one 24-hour period), which is the amount
of time that you committed to keep the vow.

`, GNYIS PA DE LA RANG SDE'I BZHED TSUL BSHAD PA NI,
The second section, an explanation of the beliefs of the our own Buddhist
school concerning how the vows are lost, is expressed in the following lines of
the root text:

,KHA CHE BYE BRAG SMRA BA RNAMS,

,BU LON NOR LDAN BZHIN DU 'DOD,
Some assert that you lose your vows
If a root downfall occurs or if
The holy teachings decline.
The Kashmiri Detailists say that when
A person with vows has a root downfall,
He's like someone wealthy with a debt.

Those of the Sutrist school of Buddhism, the one section of the Detailist school
known as "Under the Sun," and some other Buddhist groups as well assert that
if any one of the four root downfalls occurs, you lose your vows.
Some others, including the "Red-Robed Ones" (one section of the eighteen in the
Listener school) assert that you lose your vows if the holy teachings of the Buddha
decline in the world.
Those of the Kashmiri section of the Detailists though don't agree that
committing a root downfall causes you to lose your vows. They say that when
a person like a fully-ordained monk with proper individual-freedom vows has
committed one of the root downfalls like killing, he is immoral from the point
of view of not stopping himself from killing, but still moral in the sense of
stopping himself from stealing and the like.
They say thus that he's like someone wealthy with a debt. From the point of view
of having a debt, he is poor, but from the point of view of having wealth, he
is rich. The Asanga brothers, among others, do not agree that you lose your
vows if the holy teachings of the Buddha happen to decline in the world.
Their position is that even if the Buddhist teachings were to do so, those who
did not already have vows could not get new ones, but those who did already
had vows would not lose them.
BENEFITS OF KEEPING YOUR VOWS

The sixth category concerns the benefits you get from keeping the individual
vows. This will be explained in two sections: the actual explanation of the
benefits of keeping the vows of individual freedom, and some encouragement
to keep the vows which possess these benefits.

`, DANG PO NI,
The first of these two is expressed in the following verse of the root text:

,SDOM PA DE DAG BSRUNGS PA LAS,
,GNAS SKABS 'BRAS BU LHA MI DANG ,
,MTHAR THUG 'BRAS BU BYANG CHUB GSUM,
,THOB BAR 'GYUR ZHES GSUNGS PA'I PHYIR,
It is stated that, from keeping these vows,
One attains the temporal result of birth
As a pleasure being or human; and as
An ultimate result three enlightenments.

Many times, throughout all of the open and secret teachings of the Buddha and
their commentaries, it is stated that if one keeps properly the eight types of
individual freedom vows which I have just described, then he or she attains the
temporal result of a higher birth as a pleasure being or human, as well as the
ultimate result of "definite good"--which refers to one of the three kinds of
enlightenment: the enlightenment of the listener, the enlightenment of the
Self-Made Buddhas, and the unsurpassable state of total Enlightenment.
In particular, the text known as Entering the Middle Way states:
There's no other cause than the ethical life
for the definite good,
And higher rebirths, of ordinary beings,
and those born from speech,
And those individuals who are committed
to self-made Buddhahood,
And finally those who are the princes
of the victorious Buddhas.

,GNYIS PA NI,
The encouragement on keeping the vows that have these benefits is expressed
in the root text with the lines that follow next:

,BRTZON LDAN RNAMS KYIS SO SOR THAR,
,RTAG TU GUS PAS 'BAD DE BSRUNG ,
Therefore those of you willing to make effort
Should in respect and always strive to keep them.

The benefits thus have been described as limitless; therefore, for this reason,
those of you who are willing to make an effort (which means, those of you who
wish to give some meaning to the spiritual leisures and fortunes you've found)
should put forth two kinds of effort where you always strive, and strive with
feelings of respect, to keep these vows: cherish them as you do your own life,
and then give it all your strength.
THE CONCLUSION

`, GSUM PA BSHAD PA MTHAR PHYIN PA'I TSUL LA GNYIS, BSTAN BCOS BRTZAMS PA'I DGE BA BSNGO BA DANG , MDZAD BYANG BSHAD PA'O,
The conclusion of my commentary covers two points: the dedication of the
merit of composing the root text, and finally the colophon.
THE DEDICATION OF MERIT

`, DANG PO NI,
In the root text the dedication is found in the following pair of lines:

,DGE DES SKYE BAR LUS CAN RNAMS,
,RTAG TU TSANGS SPYOD LA GNAS SHOG,
By the virtue of what I've just done may every
Living creature abide forever in pure activity.

Here Je Tsongkapa dedicates whatever amount of virtue he may have gained
by composing this treatise, the one known as the Essence of the Ocean of
Discipline. He dedicates this virtue to every living creature, to a number of beings
as infinite as the extent of space itself:
From this moment on, always, may every living creature achieve a
life of leisure and opportunity. May they then enter the door of
the Buddha's teachings, and abide in the faultless morality of pure
activity. And may they thus attain, with speed, the state of the
Omniscient Victors!
THE COLOPHON

`, GNYIS PA NI,
The colophon to Je Tsongkapa's text reads as follows:

CES SO SOR THAR PA'I SDOM PA GTAN LA DBAB PA 'DUL BA RGYA MTSO'I SNYING PO BSDUS PA ZHES BYA BA 'DI NI, YUL GANGS CAN GYI MTHAR SKYES PA'I SNYAN NGAG MKHAN SHAR TZONG KHA PA BLO BZANG GRAGS PA'I DPAL GYIS SBYAR BA'O,
This completes the Briefer Essence of the Ocean of Discipline, a presentation
of the vows of individual freedom by that master of poetics, the glorious
Tsongkapa of the East, otherwise known as Lobsang Drakpa, who took his
birth in the very farthest reaches of the Land of Snow.

,ZHES PAS STON LA, DON NI, DE YANG ZHIB TU BSHAD NA CES NI GA MTHA'I TSIG PHRAD YIN CING , SO SOR THAR PA'I SDOM PA ZHES PA'I SGRA DON NI GONG DU SMOS ZIN LA DE LTA BU'I SDOM PA DE MA THOB PA THOB PAR BYA BA, THOB PA MI NYAMS PAR BSRUNG BA, NYAMS NA PHYIR 
BCOS PA'I TSUL RNAMS DNGOS SHUGS GANG RUNG GI SGO NAS GTAN LA DBAB PA STE 'BEBS PAR BYED PA'I SNGON MED PA'I LEGS BSHAD MTSAN   
Here I shall give a detailed explanation of the colophon. In the Tibetan text,
the word che (the expression "this completes" in English) is used to indicate the
end of the body of the text. The literal meaning of the phrase "vows of
individual freedom" has already been covered above.
This has been a presentation: a treatise which presents in full--either directly or
indirectly, as the subject may require--how one attains these vows if they have
yet to be attained; how one keeps them from being damaged in the case that
they have already been attained; and how one restores them should they
happen to be damaged. It is an eloquent and unprecedented study of the
subject, and it has a very special name.

   'DUL BA'I SDE SNOD KYI BRJOD BYA SPONG BDUN 'KHOR BCAS KYI TSUL KHRIMS KYIS NYON MONGS PA 'DUL ZHING DBANG PO DUL BAR BYED PAS NA 'DUL BA DANG ,
The word "discipline" in the title of this text has a particular meaning. The
subject matter of the section of the canon which treats discipline is that
morality which involves giving up the seven actions, along with what is
associated with them. This morality "disciplines" or tames the mental
afflictions, and also acts to "discipline" or control the senses. This then is why
the subject is known as "discipline."

This same section of the canon, the section on discipline, has moreover been
described as follows in the Sutra on the Vows of Individual Freedom:
That thing called individual freedom
Is the essence and heart which allows the entire
Bottomless, shoreless snow-water lake
Of the Buddha's discipline to remain.
The depth and breath of the great ocean is difficult to fathom; just so, the rules
of the holy teachings on discipline--the requirements, allowances, exceptions,
and so on--have also a depth and breadth which can only be grasped with
difficulty. And just as the ocean is the ultimate source of all jewels, the code
of discipline is the ultimate source of all the good qualities of higher births and
definite good. It is for this reason that we call this text the ocean.
The most extraordinary, essential object within the ocean is that precious jewel
which grants every wish, and in the same way the most extraordinary,
essential core of the teachings on discipline consists of the vows of individual
freedom. Here too in his treatise Je Tsongkapa has treated the vows as the
very essence, purposely highlighting and explaining them.

North of the "Seat of the Diamond" [Vajrasana, the site of the Buddha's
enlightenment], which is located in the Land of the Realized Ones [that is,
India], lies the country known as the "Snowy Land." In the "upper" part of this

country are the three states we call Ngari; in the country's center are the four
provinces of U-tsang, and in the "lower" part we find the three highlands of
Dokam.
Je Tsongkapa took his birth in the very farthest reaches of the eastern part of the
Land of Snow; that is, in the section of the three highlands of Dokam known as
the "Highlands of Tsongka," so called because the Tsongka river flows through
this area.

The Asian Classics Institute
Course IX: The Ethical Life
Reading Seven: The Ten Non-Virtues, and their Karmic Results
The following selection is taken from the Great Book on the Steps of the Path
(Lam-rim chen-mo), written by Je Tsongkapa (1357-1419).
************

,GSUM PA DE DAG GI 'BRAS BU LA GSUM LAS, RNAM SMIN GYI 'BRAS BU NI,
Here is the third section, a presentation on the consequences of the various
kinds of bad deeds. We proceed in three parts, beginning with what are called
the "ripened" consequences.

LAS LAM BCU PO RE RE YANG GZHI DUG GSUM CHUNG 'BRING CHE GSUM LA BRTEN PAS GSUM GSUM MO, , DE LA SROG GCOD SOGS CHEN PO BCU PO RE RES DMYAL BA, 'BRING BCU PO RE RES YI DVAGS DANG , CHUNG NGU BCU PO RE RES DUD 'GROR SKYE BAR SA'I DNGOS GZHIR GSUNGS LA,
Now each one of the ten paths of karma can itself be divided into three
kinds--lesser, medium, and greater--depending on the intensity of the three
poisons. The Main Stage of Levels states that, from the ten greater instances of
killing and the rest, one is born into the hells. It says that from medium
instances of each of the ten you take birth as an insatiable spirit; and from the
ten lesser instances, you are born as an animal.

SA BCU PA'I MDO LAS NI CHUNG 'BRING GNYIS KYI 'BRAS BU LDOG STE GSUNGS SO,
The Sutra on the Ten Levels however states the consequences of two of the kinds
of instances, the lesser and the medium, in reverse of this.

,RGYU MTHUN PA'I 'BRAS BU NI, NGAN 'GRO NAS MIR SKYES KYANG RIM PA LTAR TSE THUNG BA DANG LONGS SPYOD KYIS PHONGS PA DANG CHUNG MA MA BSRUNGS PAR 'GYUR BA DANG , SKUR PA MANG BA DANG MDZA' BO DANG 'BYE BA DANG YID DU MI 'ONG BA'I SGRA THOS PA DANG GZHAN GYIS TSIG MI NYAN PA DANG , CHAGS SDANG RMONGS GSUM SHAS CHE BA'O,
The "consistent" consequences are as follows. Even if you do manage to escape
the realms of misery and take birth as a human, the following respective
results occur to you:
1) Your life is short.
2) You don't have enough to live on.
3) You have problems keeping your partner from others.
4) People don't believe what you say, even when you're telling the truth.
5) You lose friends easily.
6) You hear things as bad sounds.
7) No one listens to you.
8) Your personality is dominated by desire.
9) Your personality is dominated by anger.
10) Your personality is dominated by stupidity.

,BDEN PA PO'I LE'U DANG SA BCU PA'I MDO LAS NI DE RE RE LA 'BRAS BU GNYIS GNYIS GSUNGS TE, GAL TE MIR SKYES NA YANG TSE THUNG LA NAD MANG BA DANG LONGS SPYOD CHUNG LA LONGS SPYOD GZHAN DANG THUN MONG BA DANG G-YOG 'KHOR MI BSRUN PA'AM YID BRTAN DU MI RUNG LA CHUNG MA 'GRAN ZLA DANG BCAS PA DANG , SKUR PA MANG ZHING GZHAN GYIS BSLU BA DANG 'KHOR MI 'DUM ZHING NGAN PA DANG YID DU MI 'ONG BA THOS SHING 'THAB MO'I TSIG TU 'GYUR BA DANG TSIG MI BTZUN PA'AM TSIG BZUNG MI 'OS SHING MA NGES PA'I SPOBS PAR 'GYUR BA DANG , 'DOD PA CHE ZHING CHO GA MI SHES PA DANG MI PHAN PA TSOL BA'AM PHAN PA MI 
TSOL BA DANG GZHAN LA GNOD PA BYED PA'AM GZHAN GYIS GNOD PA BYED PAR 'GYUR BA DANG LTA BA NGAN ZHING G-YO SGYU CAN DU 'GYUR BAR GSUNGS SO,
The Chapter on the True and the Sutra on the Ten Levels state that there are two
such consequences for each of the ones given here; even if you do manage to
take birth as a human,
1) Your life is short, and you get sick easily.
2) You don't have enough to live on, and what you do have is all just
common property with others.
3) The people who work around you are "inconsistent," which here
means unreliable, and you find yourself having a lot of competition for
your partner.
4) No one believes what you say, even when you are speaking the truth,
and others are always deceiving you.
5) The people around you are always fighting against one another, and
have an undesirable character.
6) You hear many unpleasant things, and when others talk to you it
always seems to you as if they want to start a fight.
7) No one respects what you say--no one thinks that what you say has
any particular value, and you are afflicted with a lack of confidence.
8) Your personality is dominated by desire, and you are never satisfied
with what you have.
9) You are always finding yourself without help, or never find the help
you need; and you are always hurting others, or always being hurt by
others.
10) You become a person who keeps harmful views, or a deceitful
person.

,BLA MA GONG MA RNAMS MIR SKYES NA YANG SROG GCOD SOGS DE DAG LA DGA' BAR 'GYUR BA BYED PA RGYU MTHUN GYI 'BRAS BU DANG SNGA MA RNAMS MYONG BA RGYU MTHUN GYI 'BRAS BUR BZHED DO,
Great lamas of the past have expressed the position that the "consistent"
consequence is where, even if you do manage to take birth as a human, you
enjoy killing things, and so on. They say then that experiencing the various
results just listed is a "ripened" consequence [the second rgyu mthun here is
likely a text error for rnam smin; this is the corrected reading].

,BDAG PO'I 'BRAS BU'AM DBANG GI 'BRAS BU NI, SROG BCAD PA LAS PHYI SNOD KYI 'JIG RTEN GYI BZA' BTUNG DANG SMAN DANG 'BRAS BU LA SOGS PA MTHU CHUNG BA DANG BSNYEMS PA DANG NUS PA DANG STOBS CHUNG BA DANG 'JU DKA' ZHING NAD BSKYED PAS SEMS CAN PHAL CHER TSE MA ZAD PAR YANG 'CHI BAR 'GYUR BA DANG,
Next is what we call the "environmental" or "dominant" consequence. Here for
example the consequence of killing expresses itself in the outer world around
you. Food, drink, medicine, the crops in the fields, and other such things have
very little power; they are always inferior; they have little nutrition or potency;
they are hard to digest, and they cause disease in you. Because of this the

Because you have stolen, then the crops are few and far between; the crops
have no power to remove hunger; they spoil; they never come up; dry spells
stay on too long; it rains too much; the crops dry up, or die off.

everywhere seems unpleasant and distasteful.

Because you have lied, you live in a world where, when you undertake
farming or some work in cooperation with other people, in the end the work
fails to prosper, and the people can't work well together, and for the most part
everyone is cheating one another, and is afraid, and where there are many
things to be afraid of.

Because you have split people up with your talk, the very ground in the place
you live is all uneven, covered with crags and gullies, full of highs and lows,
so that you can travel only with difficulty, and where you are always afraid,
and there are many things to be afraid of.

Because you have spoken harsh words, the ground where you live is covered
with obstacles like the trunks of fallen trees, and thorns, and stones, and clods
of dirt, and lots of sharp broken pieces of glass; it's rough, and dreary; no
streams, or lakes, or springs of water; the whole earth is parched, poisoned
with salt and borax, burning hot, useless, threatening; a place where there are
many things to fear.

Because you have talked meaninglessly, fruits refuse to grow on the trees, or
they start to grow at the wrong times, never at the right times, and seem ripe
when they're still not ripe, or their roots are frail, or they can't stay long; there
are no places to take your leisure, no parks, no glades, no pools of cool water,
and many things around to make you afraid.

Because you have coveted what others have, then each and every good thing

where diseases spread, and evil is everywhere, and plague, and conflict, and
fear from the armies of other nations; where there are many lions or leopards
or other dangerous animals; where there are everywhere venomous snakes or
scorpions or poison biting worms; surrounded by harmful spirits, and thieves

highest source of happiness is steadily disappearing from the earth; a world
where people think that things that are unclean and things that are suffering
are actually nice, and happy; a world where there is no place to go, no one to
help, nothing to protect you.

Course IX: The Ethical Life
Reading Eight: Introduction to the Steps of the Path
The following reading consists of the first part of the Song of My Spiritual Life
(Nyam mgur) of Je Tsongkapa (1357-1419). This text is also known as The Short
Book on the Steps of the Path (Lam rim bsdus don). Accompanying the verses of
Je Tsongkapa's root text is a commentary called Illumination of the Essence
(Snying po mdor bsdus gsal ba), composed by Choney Lama Drakpa Shedrup
(1675-1748).

Here I am going to explain the Song of My Spiritual Life, also known as the
Short Book on the Steps of the Path, composed by your and my Lama, the King
of the Dharma, the great Tsongkapa. My explanation will be in three divisions:
first the preliminaries of the offering of praise and the other preparatory steps,
then the meaning of the actual body of the text, and lastly some concluding
details.
THE PRELIMINARIES
The preliminary division of my text has two parts of its own: the offering of
praise, and an identification of that which is to be to be explained.
OFFERING OF PRAISE

`, , NA MO GU RU MNYDZU GUO sh'A YA,
I bow down to Guru Manjushri.

,DANG PO LA'ANG GNYIS TE, DANG PO NI, LA LAR NA MO GU RU MNYDZU GUO sh'A YA, ZHES 'BYUNG BA NI SLA'O,
The offering of praise is in two sections. First is the line "I bow down to Guru
Manjushri," which appears in some editions of the text. Its meaning is easy to
understand.
Prostration to the Lord of the Able Ones

,GNYIS PA LA LNGA LAS, DANG PO THUB DBANG LA PHYAG 'TSAL BA NI, PHUN TSOGS DGE LEGS BYE BAS BSKRUN PA'I SKU, , ZHES SOGS RKANG PA BZHI STE,
The second section of the offering of praise is contained in five points. The
first is an obeisance to the Lord of the Able Ones which is expressed in the

first four lines of the root text which begins "To His exalted body born from
perfect complete goodness and millions of virtues."

,PHUN TSOGS DGE LEGS BYE BAS BSKRUN PA'I SKU,
,MTHA' YAS 'GRO BA'I RE BA SKONG BA'I GSUNG ,
,MA LUS SHES BYA JI BZHIN GZIGS PA'I THUGS,
,SH'AKYA'I GTZO BO DE LA MGOS PHYAG 'TSAL,
(1)
To His Exalted body
born from perfect complete goodness
and millions of virtues,
To His exalted speech
which fulfills the hopes
of infinite living beings,
To His exalted mind
which sees each and every
knowable thing just as it is,
To the Prince of the Shakyas,
with my head
I bow down.

'DI LA MKHYEN BRTZE NUS GSUM MAM, SPANGS RTOGS KYI YON TAN SPYI DANG , BYE BRAG SKU'I YON TAN GYI DBANG DU BYAS NA, MTSAN DANG DPE BYAD SOGS YON TAN DU MAS KHYAD PAR DU BYAS PA DE NI, RGYU GANG LAS 'KHRUNGS PA YOD DE, BSOD NAMS DANG YE SHES KYIS BSDUS PA PHUN SUM TSOGS PA'I DGE LEGS RE RE TZAM MA YIN PAR BYE BAS BSKRUN PA STE BSKYED PA YIN PA'I PHYIR RO,
The general good qualities of the Buddha are the three of His knowledge, love,
and power; and also those things which He has realized and those which He
has abandoned. However, if we were to restrict ourselves to the good qualities

of His exalted body alone, it is His major and minor marks which set Him apart.
There are certain causes which produce these great qualities--they are born
from millions of instances of goodness and virtue. They are not produced by
merely some isolated occasions of this goodness and virtue, but rather by their
perfect completion, which is subsumed under the accumulations of merit and
wisdom.

,'DIR BYE BA ZHES PA NI, MANG TSIG YIN GYI, GRANGS KYI BYE BA TZAM LA MI BZUNG NGO , , MTSAN DPE RE RE LA RGYU JI TZAM DGOS PA NI, RIN CHEN 'PHRENG BA LAS GSAL LA, RGYU SO SO BA RE RE'I DBANG DU BYAS PA NI, YUM GYI MDO SOGS DANG , MNGON RTOGS RGYAN NA'ANG YOD DO, , GSUNG GI YON TAN LA NGO BO'I DBANG DU BYAS NA'ANG RUNG LA 'BRAS BU'I DBANG DU BYAS NA, DE BZHIN GSHEGS PA'I GSUNG GI YON TAN NAM BYED LAS YOD DE, GRANGS MTHA' YAS PA'I 'GRO BA'I GNAS SKABS DANG MTHAR THUG GI RE BA SKONG BAR BYED PA'I PHYIR RO,
Here the word "million" does not necessarily refer specifically to the exact
number one million, but is used rather to express a great quantity. If you are
interested in the exact kinds of causes which go into each major and minor
mark, that is clarified in The String of Precious Jewels. Such works as the Mother
Sutras, as well as the Ornament of Realizations, go through their each and every
cause individually.

,RE BA SKONG TSUL YANG , CHOS BSTAN NAS MNGON MTHO DANG NGES LEGS LA BKOD PA'I SGO NAS PHAN 'DOGS PA DANG , DE DANG DE'I SKABS KYI THE TSOM GCOD PA LA BYA'O, , THUGS KYI YON TAN GYI KHYAD PAR YOD DE, NGO BO'I DBANG DU BYAS NA MA LUS JI LTA JI SNYED KYI SHES BYA THAMS CAD JI BZHIN MNGON SUM DU GZIGS PA'I PHYIR RO, , DE LTA BU'I SKU GSUNG THUGS KYI YON TAN DANG LDAN PA, SH'AKYA'I RIGS KYI GTZO BO SH'AKYA THUB PA DE LA 
JI LTAR PHYAG 'TSAL BA YOD DE, YAN LAG GI DAM PA MGO BOS PHYAG 'TSAL BA STE 'DUD PAR BYED PA'I PHYIR RO,
The good quality of His exalted speech could be explained with regards to its
nature, but let us here consider it from the point of view of its result. The
good quality or function of the speech of the One Thus Gone is acting to fulfill
both the temporal and ultimate hopes of living beings who are infinite in number.
By what means does it fulfill their hopes? It benefits them by teaching them
those teachings which resolve the doubts at every juncture in their life, and by
leading them toward the higher realms and definite good.
As for the nature of the particular good qualities of His exalted mind, it sees
directly each and every knowable thing just as it is--all of them, the way they are,
as many as they may be.
There is a way in which we may bow down to the Prince of the Shakya clan, to
Shakyamuni, who possesses these exalted qualities of body, speech, and mind.
To Him, the able one of the Shakyas, we may bow down with the very highest
of our limbs, making prostrations with our head.
Prostration to Loving One and Gentle Voice
The second point is contained within these lines of the root text:

,ZLA MED STON PA DE YI SRAS KYI 
MCHOG,RGYAL BA'I MDZAD PA KUN GYI KHUR BSNAMS NAS,
,GRANGS MED ZHING DU SPRUL PAS RNAM ROL BA,

(2)
I bow down
to the Undefeatable,
and to Gentle Voice,
Those supreme sons
of our Teacher,
who is without rival.

Having taken on
the load of all the
Victorious One's activity,
They act by
emanating themselves
In countless paradises.

Having taken on--that is, accepted--the load of all the activity of the Victorious
One's exalted body, speech and mind, the Undefeatable Loving One and Gentle
Voice are putting on a show. Not only on this planet but in countless Buddha
paradises they are acting out their parts by emanating themselves as bodhisattvas
and other types of beings. Je Tsongkapa bows down to those two dharma sons
of our unrivaled Teacher, the two who are supreme among all bodhisattvas.
The way in which they take on the load of His activity is as follows. Both
Loving One and Gentle Voice cause the holy teachings of the Able One in
general, and more specifically, the lineage of widespread activities and the
lineage of profound view to remain and flourish in the world.
Prostration to Nagarjuna and Asanga
The third point of the offering of praise is expressed in the following verse:

,SHIN TU DPAG PAR DKA' BA RGYAL BA'I YUM,
,JI BZHIN DGONGS PA 'GREL MDZAD 'DZAM GLING RGYAN,
,KLU SGRUB THOGS MED CES NI SA GSUM NA,
,YONGS SU GRAGS PA'I ZHABS LA BDAG PHYAG 'TSAL,
(3)
To those jewels
of our Southern Continent
who commented just as was meant
Upon the Mother of the Victors
which is so very
difficult to fathom.
To those who are
known throughout
all of the three realms
To Nagarjuna and Asanga
at their feet
I bow down.

,GSUM PA NI, SHIN TU DPAG PAR DKA' BA SOGS BZHI STE, PHYAG 'TSAL LO, , GANG LA NA, RGYAL BA'I GSUNG RAB SPYI DANG KHYAD PAR, SHIN TU DPAG PAR TE RTOGS PAR DKA' BA RGYAL BA'I YUM RGYAS 'BRING BSDUS PA GSUM GYI DON JI LTA BA BZHIN DU DGONGS PA 'GREL PAR MDZAD PA'I SGO NAS 'DZAM GLING GI RGYAN DU GYUR PA MTSON LA MGON PO KLU SGRUB DANG 'PHAGS PA THOGS MED CES NI SA 'OG SA STENG SA BLA STE SA GSUM NA YONGS SU GRAGS PA'I ZHABS LA'O, , GANG GIS NA, BDAG BLO BZANG GRAGS PA'I DPAL GYIS SO,
Here the prostration is made in general to the highest form of speech--that of
the Victorious Buddhas--and more particularly to the savior Nagarjuna and the
realized being Asanga. These two are here named to represent all of those who
commented just as it was meant to be upon the true intent of those sutras which
are so very difficult to fathom; that is, to grasp. Here we are referring to the
Mother of the Victors in all its three forms--extensive, middle length, and brief.
These two masters, who are known throughout all the three realms--below the
earth, upon the earth, and above the earth-- have become like the jewels of our
Southern Continent. The "I" referred to here in the text, the one who is bowing
down at their feet, is the glorious Lobsang Drakpa.
Prostration to Atisha
These lines contain the fourth point of the offering of praise:

,SHING RTA CHEN PO GNYIS LAS LEGS BRGYUD PA'I,
,ZAB MO'I LTA BA RGYA CHEN SPYOD PA'I LAM,
,MA NOR YONGS SU RDZOGS PA'I GNAD BSDUS PA'I,
,GDAMS PA'I MDZOD 'DZIN MAR ME MDZAD LA 'DUD,
(4)
I bow down to the Maker of Light,
the one who holds
the treasury of instructions
Which contain without mistake,
the totality of
all the important points--
Those of the path
of profound view,
and those of widespread activity--
Which came down to him
so perfectly through the lineage
of the two great innovators.

,BZHI PA NI, SHING RTA CHEN PO GNYIS LAS SOGS BZHI STE, 'DUD DO, , GANG LA NA, SHING RTA CHEN PO KLU SGRUB DANG THOGS MED RNAM PA GNYIS LAS LEGS PAR BRGYUD PA'I ZAB MO LTA BA DANG , RGYA CHEN SPYOD PA'I LAM GYI RIM PA TSANG LA MA NOR BAR YONGS SU RDZOGS PA'I GNAD BSDUS PA'I GDAMS PA'I MDZOD 'DZIN PA DPAL MAR ME MDZAD LA'O, , DE YANG JO BO CHEN POS BLA MA GSER GLING PA BSTEN NAS BYAMS PA DANG THOGS MED NAS BRGYUD PA'I GDAMS PA GSAN LA, RIGS PA'I KHU BYUG BSTEN NAS 'JAM DBYANGS DANG KLU SGRUB NAS BRGYUD PA'I GDAMS NGAG 
[?]
 MA LUS PA GSAN NAS GDAMS PA'I CHU BO GNYIS ZUNG DU 'BREL BAR MDZAD DO,
Here Je Tsongkapa bows down to Atisha, the glorious Maker of Light. He is the
one who holds the treasury of instructions which contain in their entirety without
mistake the totality of all the important points of the steps of the path of the
teachings on profound view and widespread activity. These instructions came down
to him perfectly through the lineage which began with the two great innovators,
Nagarjuna and Asanga. By relying on the Lama Serlingpa, the Great Lord
Atisha heard those teachings which came down through the lineage of Loving
One and Asanga, and by relying on Vidyakokila he heard in their entirety the
teachings from the lineage of Gentle Voice and Nagarjuna. He then composed
commentaries combining together these two great currents of teachings.
Prostration to all Spiritual Guides
The last point of the offering of praise in contained within this verse of the root
text:
 , RAB 'BYAMS GSUNG RAB KUN LA LTA BA'I

I bow down
with deep respect
to all Spiritual Guides.
Inspired by their love
they act with skillful means
in order to make clear
The supreme entry point
for those fortunate ones
who are travelling to freedom--
That eye which can see

of the Buddha's supreme speech.

This very teaching on the steps of the path for people of the three capacities
is like an eye with which you can see all the myriad forms of the Buddha's supreme
speech, and not only certain parts of it. It is also the supreme entry point and
path which allows fortunate disciples to travel to freedom. Here our Lord bows
down to all the Spiritual Guides who inspired and driven by their exalted thoughts
of love are acting with skillful means in order to make this teaching clear to their

disciples. He bows down not only in his words, but with deep thoughts of
respect.
Some people explain that the words "that eye which can see" refer to the
Spiritual Guide, but Je Tsongkapa's true intention was that the "eye" refer to
the teaching on the steps itself. This fact is made clear towards the ends of his
Great Book on the Steps of the Path.
IDENTIFICATION OF WHAT IS GOING TO BE EXPLAINED
Now I shall identify that which is actually going to be explained in three
sections: details of the lineage of the teaching, its special features, and its
necessity.
Details of the Lineage
The details of the lineage are explained in this verse:

,'DZAM GLING MKHAS PA YONGS KYI GTZUG GI RGYAN,
,SNYAN PA'I BA DAN 'GRO NA LHANG NGE BA,
,KLU SGRUB THOGS MED GNYIS LAS RIM BZHIN DU,
,LEGS BRGYUD BYANG CHUB LAM GYI RIM PA NI,
(6)
These steps of the path
to enlightenment
progressively came down
Through an excellent lineage
from both Nagarjuna,
and Asanga--
Those jewels on the crowns
of all the great masters
of our world--
Whose brilliance shines
like a victory banner
among living beings.

,GNYIS PA BSHAD BYA NGOS BZUNG BA LA GSUM, BRGYUD PA'I KHYAD PAR, KHYAD CHOS, DGOS PA'O, , DANG PO NI, 'DZAM GLING MKHAS PA YONGS KYI SOGS BZHI STE, 'DZAM GLING 'DIR BYON PA'I MKHAS PA YONGS KYI GTZUG GI RGYAN DU GYUR CING , MKHAS PA'I SNYAN PA PHYOGS KUN TU GRAGS PA'I BA DAN 'GRO BA'I GNAS 'DI NA NYI MA LTAR LHANG NGER GSAL BA KLU SGRUB DANG THOGS MED GNYIS LAS RIM PA BZHIN DU LEGS PAR BRGYUD PA'I BYANG CHUB LAM GYI RIM PA'I GZHUNG NYID 'CHAD PAR BYA'O, , ZHES RTZOM PA DAM BCA' DON GYIS MDZAD DO,
That which I shall explain is precisely those great books on the steps of the path
to enlightenment which came down to us progressively thorough an excellent lineage
beginning with both Nagarjuna and Asanga. Of all the great masters who ever
came to our world, they were like the jewels on the tips of their crowns. In this
land, among living beings, the fame of their knowledge was as brilliant and clear
as the sun, shining in all directions like a banner of victory.
Implicitly in these lines Je Tsongkapa pledges to compose his treatise.
Special Features of the Teaching

,GNYIS PA LA GNYIS, DPE DON GYI KHYAD PAR DANG , KHYAD CHOS DNGOS SO, , DANG PO NI,
There are two points to the special features of this teachings: certain special
metaphors and their meanings, and its actual special features.
The special metaphors and their meanings are set forth in this verse of the root
text:

Because it fulfills every
desire of the many
kinds of people,
It's like a king among lords
of the precious gems
of instruction.
Because it combines all together
the river currents
of thousands of fine scriptures,
It's like a great ocean
of glorious and
excellent explanation.

There are special metaphors used to describe this teaching on the steps of the
path to enlightenment, which was passed down to us in the lineage just
described. Because it fulfills every desire of the many kinds of people who seek

freedom, it is like a king among the lords of all the precious gems of
instruction--just like that special jewel which grants your every wish. It can
fulfill your wishes because if you practice its true meaning, you will achieve
higher births and definite good.
Because this teaching combines all together the river currents of the fine
explanations found in the thousands of fine scriptures of the greater and lesser
ways, it is like a great ocean of glorious--that is, perfect--and excellent explanation.
It brings them all together not by including each and every word of the
scriptures, but rather by incorporating the meanings of all their subject matter.
The expression "thousands of scriptures" is used here to indicate a great

scriptures.

You'll realize that

totally lack inconsistency,
And His highest of speech

You will easily

And be protected from

This teachings possesses four special features, or you could say four great
qualities. The first is that if you rely on this teaching you will come to realize
that all of the Buddha's teachings are totally lacking any inconsistency. Of all the
teachings spoken by the Victorious Buddhas, however many there may be,
some of them teach the principal paths and others teach that which branches
off from them. Once you know this, you will come to understand that they are
all either direct or indirect factors in reaching enlightenment.
You will not have the wrong view which considers the open and secret
teachings of the Buddha--those highest of all words--and the classical
commentaries which comment upon their true intent to be mere explanations.
You will not think that you have to look somewhere other than in the content
of these books for something to use for your personal practice. Rather you will
come to see that the entire subject matter of the Buddha's supreme speech
along with its classical commentaries is perfectly in keeping with the
progressive structure through which you do your actual practice. You will
come to understand how it is that every step from taking yourself to a Spiritual
Guide all the way up to the practices of developing quietude and special vision
can be put into your personal practice, either through analytical meditation or
through fixation meditation.
If you understand these points, then all of the high speech of the Buddha will
strike you as personal advice. This is the second of the great qualities. Even
though all of the teachings of the Buddha are the ultimate form of personal
instruction, us spiritual beginners who haven't studied enough are unable to
understand the true intent of the great scriptures on our own, nor are we able
to bring them into our personal practice. Therefore we need to rely on
something like this teaching on the steps of the path to enlightenment, through
which our Lamas give us their personal advice on the true meaning of these
original works.
This makes it easy for us to grasp the true intent of the Victorious Buddhas, and
that is another great quality of the teaching on the steps. Once you find this
true intent, you will understand that every word the Buddha ever said

contributes either directly or indirectly to our reaching enlightenment, and that
there is not a single word He spoke which does not teach a method of
achieving enlightenment.
In the Buddha's teachings there can appear to be some slight inconsistencies,
which are required due to the needs of particular disciples, and there are also
distinctions between the higher and lower teachings. But there is no difference
between any of them from the point of view that they were all taught solely
as methods for reaching enlightenment. If you become certain of this, you will
never commit the bad deed of rejecting Buddhist teachings, and will thus be
protected from falling into the chasm of that great mistake. This is the last of the
four great qualities.
Necessity of the Teaching

,GSUM PA LA GNYIS, CHE BA DE LDAN GYI CHOS 'DI NYAMS SU LEN RIGS PA DANG , NYAMS SU BLANGS PA'I PHAN YON NO, , DANG PO NI,
The necessity of the teaching has two points: first why it is proper to practice
this teaching which has these great qualities, and then the benefits of having
put it into practice. These lines explain why it is proper to practice this
teachings:

,DE PHYIR RGYA BOD MKHAS PA'I SKYE BO NI,
,SKAL LDAN DU MAS BSTEN PA'I GDAMS PA 
MCHOG,SKYES BU GSUM GYI LAM GYI RIM PA YIS,
,YID RAB MI 'PHROG DPYOD LDAN SU ZHIG YOD,
(9)
Therefore,
many learned masters,
both Indian and Tibetan,
Those ones with virtue's seed,
took as the very basis
of their personal practice

The supreme instructions
on the steps of the path
for people of three capacities.
Would they not then
steal away the heart
of any discerning person?

This tradition possesses the great qualities I explained above; for this reason,
therefore, many learned Indian and Tibetan masters who had the necessary seeds of
virtue took as the very basis of their personal practice the supreme instructions on the
steps of the path for people of three capacities--those of lesser, medium and the
greater capacities. Would these instructions not then steal away the heart of any
discerning person? Of course they would.
The benefits of having put the teachings of the path to enlightenment into
practice are explained here:

,GSUNG RAB KUN GYI SNYING PO BSDU BSDU BA,

(10)
In but a single session
of imparting and learning
this system of teaching,

Which incorporates in brief
the very essence
of all the supreme speech,
You are certain to obtain
in one fell swoop
all the benefits
Of explaining and listening to
the entire teachings;
contemplate this fact.

The major scriptures describe a great number of benefits that occur when you
explain or listen to any one teaching of the Buddha. Suppose you were to
devote but a single session, much less a number of sessions, to imparting and
learning this system of teaching: the steps of the path. Because it incorporates in
brief the very essence of all the supreme speech belonging to both the greater and
lesser ways, it is certain that you would then in one fell swoop obtain all the
benefits of explaining and listening to all the Buddha's teachings in their entirety.
You should therefore contemplate this fact. In a brief way then Je Tsongkapa is
giving us personal advice about our practice.
The phrase "incorporates in brief" [du du in the Tibetan] refers to the fact that
the teachings on the steps of the path incorporate [du] the vital points of the
entire supreme speech of the Buddha, and do so in an abbreviated [du] way.

Course IX: The Ethical Life
Reading Nine: Description of the Lesser Capacity
The following reading consists of the second major section of the Song of My
Spiritual Life (Nyam mgur) of Je Tsongkapa (1357-1419). This text is also known
as The Short Book on the Steps of the Path (Lam-rim bsdus-don). Accompanying
the verses of Je Tsongkapa's root text is a commentary called Illumination of the
Essence (Snying-po mdor-bsdus gsal-ba), composed by Choney Lama Drakpa
Shedrup (1675-1748).
****************
THE ACTUAL BODY OF THE TEXT

,GNYIS PA GZHUNG GI DON BSHAD PA LA, MCHOD BRJOD SOGS NI, GZHUNG GI YAN LAG YIN LA, 'DIR GZHUNG DON DNGOS KYI DBANG DU BYAS TE 'CHAD PA LA GNYIS, THUN MONG BA DANG , THUN MONG MA YIN PA'I LAM LA BSLAB TSUL LO, , DANG PO LA GNYIS, SNGON 'GRO DANG , DNGOS GZHI'O, , DANG PO NI,
Those points concerning the offering of praise and so on are secondary parts
of the text. Here I am going to make my explanation with reference to the
actual meaning of the text. I shall do so in two parts: the way to practice the
shared paths, and the way to practice the path which is not shared.
THE WAY TO PRACTICE THE SHARED PATHS
The discussion of the way to practice the shared paths is divided into two: the
preliminary step followed by the main steps.

THE PRELIMINARY STEP
The preliminary step is covered in these lines of the root text:

,DE NAS 'DI PHYI'I LEGS TSOGS JI SNYED PA'I,
,RTEN 'BREL LEGS PAR 'GRIG PA'I RTZA BA NI,
,LAM STON BSHES GNYEN DAM PA 'BAD PA YIS,

,RNAL 'BYOR NGAS KYANG NYAMS LEN DE LTAR BGYIS,
,THAR 'DOD KHYED KYANG DE BZHIN BSKYANG 'TSAL LO,
(11)
After having done this, see that
the very foundation
Of an excellent start for all the good
in this and your future lives
Is the holy Spiritual Guide
who teaches you the path.
Make efforts to rely on Him properly
in your thoughts and in your actions;
Please Him with the offering of
carrying out His every instruction.
And never give it up, not even
at the cost of your life.
I, the master meditator,
lived my life this way;
You, who seek for freedom,
must try to do the same.

DE NAS 'DI PHYI'I LEGS TSOGS SOGS BRGYAD DE, LAM RIM YONGS RDZOGS DANG DE'I CHA SHAS TZAM LAS SU BLANGS PA LAS KYANG PHAN YON CHEN PO YOD TSUL BSAM PA SOGS SNGON DU BTANG STE DE NAS 'DI LTAR NYAMS SU BLANG BAR BYA'O, , ZHES MTSAMS SBYAR RO,
First you must contemplate the points above, such as the great benefits that
come from putting into practice all, or even just a part of, the steps of the path.
After having done this, says Je Tsongkapa, you should begin the actual practices
which are to follow. He uses these words to lead the reader into the actual
steps of the path.

,PHAN YON DE LTAR MTHONG BA DES, 'DI DANG PHYI MA'I LEGS TSOGS JI SNYED MCHIS PA'I RTEN 'BREL LEGS PAR 'GRIG PAR 'GYUR BA'I RTZA BA NI, RANG LA LAM STON PA'I DGE BA'I BSHES GNYEN DAM PAR SHES PAR BYAS TE, 'BAD PA DRAG PO YIS, BLA MA LA SKYON RTOG GI BLO BKAG NAS DAD PA SKYE CI THUB BYED PA'I SGO NAS BSAM PAS BSTEN PA DANG , BLA MA MNYES PA SGO MTHA' DAG NAS BSGRUB CING MA MNYES PA NAM YANG MI BSGRUB PA DANG , LUS KYIS BKUR ZHING NGAG GIS BSTOD PA SOGS DANG , CI GSUNG BKA' BZHIN DU SGRUB PA'I SGO NAS SBYOR BAS TSUL BZHIN DU BSTEN PA RU STE BSTEN PA LA RAG LAS PAR MTHONG NAS RKYEN CUNG ZAD TZAM DU MA ZAD, SROG GI PHYIR YANG MI GTONG BAR BKA' BZHIN DU SGRUB PA'I MCHOD PAS MNYES PAR BYED DGOS SO,
Having understood these benefits, you must then see that the holy Spiritual
Guide who teaches you the path is the very foundation for getting you off to an
excellent start for all the good in this and your future lives. Realize that all this
depends on how you serve your Lama, and then with fierce efforts rely on Him
in your thoughts by stopping that state of mind which thinks it sees faults in
Him, and by developing feelings of faith towards Him as much as you can.
Rely properly on your Lama in your actions by paying Him respect with your
body, praising Him with your words, and so forth. Undertake whatever you
can to please your Lama in every possible way, and never undertake anything
which would displease Him. Accomplish whatever He or She tells you to do.

Understanding this, you must please your Lama with the offering of carrying out
His every instruction. You can never give this up even at the cost of you life, so
what need is there to say anything about mere small incidents?

,DE'I MJUG TU, RJE'I GSUNG 'BUM THOR BU LAS, RNAL 'BYOR NGAS KYANG NYAMS LEN DE LTAR BYAS, , THAR 'DOD KHYED KYANG DE BZHIN BSKYANG 'TSAL LO, , ZHES 'BYUNG BA NI, RJE'I GSUNG DNGOS YIN LA, CHOS SPYOD LAS, RJE BTZUN BLA MAS NYAMS LEN DE LTAR MDZAD, , THAR 'DOD BDAG KYANG DE BZHIN BSKYANG 'TSAL LO, , ZHES 'BYUNG BA NI, PHYIS GZHAN GYIS BSGYUR BA STE, DON GO SLA ZHING PHYI MA GZHAN LA'ANG SBYOR, BLA MA'I MTSAN NYID, BSTEN TSUL SOGS LAM RIM SOGS NAS SHES PAR BYA'O,
After these instructions come a special refrain, beginning with the words "I, the
master meditator..." These are the actual lines as Je Tsongkapa first wrote
them. Later on they were changed by someone else, and in modern prayer
books we see the following:
The venerable Lamas of the past
lived their lives this way;
I, too, seeking freedom
will try to do the same.
The meaning of the refrain is easy to understand. When it appears later on in
the text, refer back to what I have said here.
If you want to know the defining qualities of a Lama, the way in which you
should rely on Him or Her, and other such details, you can learn them in the
books on the steps of the path, and other such works.
THE MAIN STEPS
The section on the main steps has two points: an urging to take the essence of
your leisure and fortune, and the way to take that essence.
An Urging to Take the Essence of This Life
The urging is expressed in these lines of the root text:

,DAL BA'I RTEN 'DI YID BZHIN NOR LAS 
LHAG,'DI 'DRA RNYED PA DA RES TZAM ZHIG YIN,
(12a)
This body of leisure is more valuable than
a jewel which grants every wish;
And now is the only time that you
have found such a life as this.

,GNYIS PA LA GNYIS, DAL 'BYOR LA SNYING PO LEN PAR BSKUL BA DANG , SNYING PO JI LTAR LEN TSUL LO, , DANG PO NI, DAL BA'I RTEN 'DI YID BZHIN NOR SOGS TE, DAL BRGYAD 'BYOR BCU LDAN PA'I SGO NAS CHOS SGRUB PA LA KHOS PAS NA DAL BA'I RTEN KHYAD PAR CAN 'DI NI, YID BZHIN GYI NOR BU RIN PO CHE LAS KYANG LHAG PA 'DI 'DRA BA NI SNGAR YANG YANG RNYED PA MA YIN GYI RNYED PA DUS DA RES TZAM ZHIG YIN NO, , DES RNYED NA DON CHE BAR MA ZAD, RNYED PAR DKA' BAR BSTAN TO,
Having the eight leisures and the ten fortunes is essential to practicing the
Buddhist teachings. Therefore, this very special body and life of leisure which
you now have is even more valuable then a precious jewel which grants every wish.
It is not something which you were able to find over and over again in the
past. Now is the only time you have been able to find a life such as this one.
These lines do not only indicate how meaningful it is to have found such a life,
but also how difficult it is to find.

,YID BZHIN GYI NOR BU LAS LHAG TSUL NI NOR BU LAS DGOS 'DOD 'BYUNG YANG TSE 'DI'I GNAS SKABS KYI 'DOD DON YIN LA, RTEN 'DI LA BRTEN NAS MNGON MTHO TZAM DU MA ZAD, NGES LEGS THAR PA DANG THAMS CAD MKHYEN PA BSGRUBS NA'ANG THOB NUS PAR GSUNGS PA'I PHYIR NA LHAG GO, DE LTAR RNYED DKA' ZHING RNYED NA DON CHE BA'I DAL 
'BYOR GYI RTEN 'DI DON MED DU MI BTANG BAR 'DI LA RANG GIS CI NUS KYI SGO NAS CHOS BYA BA'I DAM BCA' BRTAN PO BYA'O,
How is this life more valuable than a wish-fulfilling jewel? From such a jewel
you can get the things you need and the things you want, but these benefits
are only the temporal objects you may wish for in this life. It has been stated
by the Buddha that if you use your body and mind properly, not only can you
reach the higher births, you can also achieve definite good--freedom and the
state of all-knowing. Therefore, this life is more valuable.
Suppose you do happen to find a body and mind with these leisures and
fortunes, so difficult to attain and, once attained, so meaningful. You should
not spend them meaninglessly. Make a firm pledge to yourself that you will
practice the Buddhist teachings to the very best of your ability.
The Way to Take the Essence of This Life
The way to take the essence of this life has two sub-sections: how the teachings
are organized into sections of the path, and the way of actually practicing
them.

,GNYIS PA SNYING PO JI LTAR LEN TSUL LA GNYIS, LAM GYI DBANG DU BYAS PA'I GSUNG RAB RNAMS 'DU TSUL DANG , NYAMS SU LEN TSUL DNGOS SO, , DANG PO NI, SANGS RGYAS BCOM LDAN 'DAS KYIS CHOS KYI PHUNG PO JI SNYED CIG GSUNGS PA NI SEMS CAN GYI DON DU YIN LA, DE YANG MNGON MTHO NGES LEGS GNYIS LAS, MNGON MTHO LAS BRTZAMS TE GTZO BOR GSUNGS PA RNAMS SKYES BU CHUNG NGU DNGOS SAM DE DANG THUN MONG BA'I CHOS SKOR DU 'DU ZHING , NGES LEGS LA GNYIS LAS THAR PA LAS BRTZAMS TE GTZO BOR GSUNGS PA RNAMS SKYES BU 'BRING DNGOS SAM DE DANG THUN MONG BA'I CHOS SKOR DU 'DU LA, THAMS CAD MKHYEN PA SGRUB PA LAS BRTZAMS TE GSUNGS PA THAMS CAD SKYES BU CHEN PO'I CHOS SKOR DU 'DU BA YIN NO,
However many mountains of teachings were spoken by the Conquering
Buddhas, all of them were meant to benefit living beings. If we look at them
from the point of view of higher births and definite good, those teachings
spoken by the Buddha which mainly address higher births belong to that
group of teachings called either the actual path for people of lesser capacity,
or the path shared with them. Those teachings which deal principally with
freedom, one of the two parts of definite good, belong to the group of the
teachings called either the actual path for people of medium capacity, or those
sections of the path which are shared with them. Everything ever spoken by
the Buddha which addresses how to achieve the state of all-knowing is
included in the group of teachings for people of greater capacity.

,'DIR SKYES BU CHUNG 'BRING DANG THUN MONG BA'I LAM 'GA' ZHIG SKYES BU CHEN PO'I LAM GYI YAN LAG TU DGOS PA DER 'KHRID PA YIN GYI, SKYES BU CHUNG 'BRING DNGOS KYI LAM LA 'KHRID PA NI MA YIN TE, MNGON MTHO TZAM ZHIG DON GNYER GYI BLO DE SKYES BU CHUNG NGU'I LAM DNGOS DANG , RANG DON DU THAR PA TZAM ZHIG DON GNYER GYI BLO DE SKYES BU 'BRING GI LAM DNGOS YIN PAS, DER 'KHRID NA NI SKYES BU CHEN PO'I LAM GYI GOL SAR 'KHRID PA'I SKYON DU 'GYUR BA'I PHYIR RO,
In this tradition we lead students along those parts of the path shared with
people of lesser and medium capacity which are necessary accessories to the
path of those of greater capacity. We do not however lead them along the
actual paths of people of lesser and medium capacity. This is because what we
call the actual path for people of lesser capacity consists of the state of mind
where one aspires only for the higher births, and what we call the actual path
for people of medium capacity consists of the state of mind where one aspires
for freedom solely for one's own benefit. And so if we were to lead our
students along these paths, there would come the problem that we would be
leading them into a grave point of error in the path for people of greater
capacity.

,'O NA, DE GNYIS DANG THUN MONG BA'I LAM JI LTA BU ZHE NA, SDIG SPONG DGE BA SGRUB PA'I SGO NAS MNGON MTHO DON GNYER GYI BLO DE, SKYES BU CHUNG NGU DANG THUN MONG BA'I LAM DANG , 'KHOR BA LAS GROL 'DOD KYI SGO NAS THAR PA DON GNYER GYI BLO DE SKYES BU 'BRING DANG 
THUN MONG BA'I LAM YIN TE, DE GNYIS KA'ANG BYANG SEMS KYI RGYUD LA YOD CING , DES NYAMS SU LEN DGOS PA'I PHYIR RO,
Someone may then ask, what the difference is between these two actual paths
(for people of lesser and medium capacity) and those which are shared with
them. The path shared with people of lesser capacity consists of the state of
mind in which one aspires to reach the higher births by means of giving up
bad deeds and accomplishing good ones. The path shared with those of
medium capacity consists of the state of mind in which one aspires to reach
freedom by developing the true desire to be free from the entire cycle of
suffering. These two attitudes are also present in the mental continua of
bodhisattvas, and they must put them into practice.

,GAL TE SKYES BU CHUNG 'BRING GI LAM GNYIS SKYES BU CHEN PO'I LAM GYI GOL SA YIN NA, DE'I GEGS SAM MI MTHUN PHYOGS YIN PA'I PHYIR 'TSANG RGYA BA'I THABS KYANG MA YIN PAR 'GYUR RO ZHE NA, SKYON MED DE, LAM DE GNYIS SKYES BU CHEN PO MYUR DU 'TSANG RGYA BA'I LAM GYI GOL SA YIN PAS DE 'TSANG RGYA BA'I THABS MA YIN KYANG , NYAN RANG RNAMS RIM GYIS RGYUD SMIN TE 'TSANG RGYA BA'I THABS SU 'GYUR BA LA 'GAL BA CI YANG MED PA'I PHYIR RO, , DE YANG RANG NYID GCIG PU ZHI BDE DON GNYER GYI BLO LTA BU LA GTZO BOR DGONGS PA'O,
Someone might then make the following objection. Suppose those two paths
for people of lesser and medium capacity really are grave points of error for
people of greater capacity. In that case, they would have to be an obstacle
toward, or even in contradiction with, the path of the greater way. And then
they could never constitute a method for reaching enlightenment.
But the objection is unfounded. Those two paths do constitute a grave error
in the path for people of greater capacity; they prevent these people from
reaching enlightenment quickly. From this point of view then, these two paths
are not a method for reaching enlightenment, but it's no contradiction at all to
say that they constitute a method for reaching enlightenment, in the sense that
they act to gradually ripen the mental continua of listeners and "self-made"
Buddhas. The point about being a grave error refers primarily to details such

as the state of mind where one aspires to reach a state of blissful peace for
oneself alone.

,GNYIS PA LA GSUM, SKYES BU CHUNG NGU DANG THUN MONG BA'I LAM, 'BRING DANG THUN MONG BA'I LAM, CHEN PO'I LAM DNGOS SO,
The way to practice taking the essence of this life will be explained in three
divisions: the path shared with people of lesser capacity, the path shared with
people of medium capacity, and the actual path for people of greater capacity.
THE PATH SHARED WITH PEOPLE OF LESSER CAPACITY

,DANG PO LA GNYIS, PHYI MA DON GNYER GYI BLO BSKYED PA, PHYI MA'I BDE THABS BSTEN PA'O, , DANG PO LA GNYIS, 'CHI BA MI RTAG PA BSAM PA DANG , NGAN 'GRO'I SDUG BSNGAL BSAM PA'O,
The path shared with people of lesser capacity has two parts of its own:
developing the state of mind in which you look ahead to your future lives, and
how to make use of those methods which can bring you happiness in your
future lives.
DEVELOPING THE STATE OF MIND WHICH LOOKS AHEAD TO FUTURE LIVES
Developing the state of mind which looks ahead to your future lives has two
sections: the contemplation on your impermanence-- the fact that you have to
die, and the contemplation on the sufferings of the lower realms.
The Contemplation on Your Impermanence
The contemplation on your impermanence--the fact that you must die--is
found in the following lines of the root text:

,RNYED DKA' 'JIG SLA NAM MKHA'I GLOG DANG 'DRA,

,THAR 'DOD KHYED KYANG DE BZHIN BSKYANG 'TSAL LO,
(12b)
It's difficult to find, and easily destroyed
like lightning in the sky.
Think this over carefully,
and come to realize:
All the activities of the world
are chaff blown in the wind.
To take the essence of this life,
you must strive night and day.
I, the master meditator,
lived my life this way;
You, who seek for freedom,
must try to do the same.

,DANG PO NI, RNYED DKA' 'JIG SLA SOGS BZHI STE, RGYU, NGO BO, DPE'I SGO NAS RNYED PAR DKA' ZHING , 'CHI RKYEN MANG BAS 'JIG PAR SLA BA NI, DPER NA, NAM MKHA'I GLOG MYUR DU 'JIG PA DANG 'DRA BA'I TSUL 'DI BSAMS NAS DGRA 'DUL GNYEN SKYONG SOGS 'JIG RTEN GYI BYA BA KUN DPER NA, SNYING PO MED PA'I SHUN PA'I SBUN PA 'PHYAR BA BZHIN DU DON MED PAR RTOGS PAR GYUR NAS NYIN MTSAN KUN TU RTEN 'DI LA SNYING PO LEN PA DGOS SO,
The difficulty of finding this life can be expressed from the point of view of its
causes, its very nature, and certain metaphors. And because the things which
can kill you are so many, this life is easily destroyed. Carefully think over the
example of how quickly a flash of lightning disappears from the sky, and how
your life is just like that. All the activities of the world--such as defeating your

enemies and protecting your friends--are devoid of any real essence. Rather
they are like the chaff or husk of grain blown in the wind. Realizing that these
activities are meaningless, you must then strive night and day to take the essence
of this life.
The Contemplation on the Sufferings of the Lower Realms
The contemplation on the suffering of the lower realms is expressed in the next
line of the root text:

There is no guarantee that after you die
you won't be born in the lower realms.

Not only is it true that you are impermanent and must die, but after you die
you must take birth exactly where your white and black deeds throw you.
Good deeds throw you into the higher realms and bring you experiences of
happiness, whereas bad deeds throw you into the lower realms and bring you
experiences of suffering.

As you haven't been able to accumulate many causes to be born in the higher
realms, but have rather collected many causes to be born in the lower realms,
there is no guarantee that in your next life you will not be born in the hells or the
other lower realms. Not only is there no guarantee that you will not be born
there, in all likelihood you will be born there. Contemplate again and again
the sufferings of the lower realms, and try to develop a very strong desire to
be free from them.
METHODS FOR ACHIEVING HAPPINESS IN YOUR FUTURE LIVES
The explanation of the methods for achieving happiness in your future lives
has three sections: the teachings on going for refuge, along with certain advices
concerning this practice; a description of the need to act properly with regard
to what you should and should not be doing relative to the two kinds of
deeds; and an explanation of the foundation for achieving the state of all-
knowing.
Going for Refuge, and the Advices for this Practice
The next part of the root text concerns going for refuge and its advices:

,DE YI 'JIGS SKYOB DKON MCHOG GSUM DU NGES,
,DE PHYIR SKYABS 'GRO SHIN TU BRTAN PA DANG ,
,DE YI BSLAB BYA NYAMS PA MED PAR BYA,
(13b)
And it is precisely the Three Jewels
which protect you from these fears;
For that reason, taking refuge should be
something very firm,
And you should never allow the advices
concerning it to be broken.

,GNYIS PA PHYI MA'I BDE THABS LA GSUM, SKYABS 'GRO BSLAB BYA DANG BCAS PA DANG , DE LA LAS GNYIS KYI BLANG DOR LA 'JUG DGOS PA DANG , RNAM MKHYEN SGRUB PA'I RTEN BSHAD PA'O, , DANG PO NI, DE YI 'JIGS SKYOB DKON MCHOG GSUM SOGS GSUM

Thus by the power of your past deeds will you fall into the lower realms. The
refuge which can protect you from these fears of the lower realms is precisely the
Three Jewels. It is said in scripture that:
The refuge for those who desire freedom
Is the Buddha, the Dharma, and Community.
The point of this quotation is that you must go for refuge, through
understanding the different characteristics and good qualities of each one of
the Three Jewels. The way to go for refuge is first of all to develop the state
of mind which believes that the Three Jewels possess the ability to protect you
from the sufferings of the lower realms and the cycle of suffering. And then,
from the bottom of your heart, you must put all of your faith in them. Once
you have understood that these three do have the power to protect you from
your fears, you should take yourself to them for refuge, in order to gain this
protection. Taking refuge should be something very firm in your mind. As for the
common and unique advices which concern going for refuge as they are
explained in the Steps of the Paths and other books, you must be careful that
you never allow them to be broken.

What to Take Up and What to Give Up
The need to act properly with regard to what you should and shouldn't be
doing relative to the two kinds of deeds is expressed in these lines:

,DE YANG DKAR NAG LAS 'BRAS LEGS BSAMS NAS,
,BLANG DOR TSUL BZHIN SGRUB LA RAG LAS SO,
,RNAL 'BYOR NGAS KYANG NYAMS LEN DE LTAR BGYIS,
,THAR 'DOD KHYED KYANG DE BZHIN BSKYANG 'TSAL LO,
(13c)
Contemplate well upon white and black
deeds and their results,
Since this depends on acting properly,
towards what to do and not.
I, the master meditator,
lived my life this way;
You, who seek for freedom,
must try to do the same.

,GNYIS PA NI, DE YANG DKAR NAG LAS 'BRAS SOGS TE, DE YANG DAD PA LA SPYIR DANG BA'I DAD PA, YID CHES PA'I DAD PA, 'DOD PA'I DAD PA DANG GSUM YOD KYANG 'DIR NI GTZO BO YID CHES PA'I DAD PA STE, DKON MCHOG GIS SKYOB PA DE YANG LAS 'BRAS LA BLANG DOR PHYIN CI LOG TU BSGRUBS NA MI 'BYUNG BAS, DKAR PO DGE BA DANG NAG PO MI DGE BA'I LAS 'BRAS BU DANG BCAS PA JI LTAR YIN LEGS PAR BSAMS NAS DGE BA 'BRAS BU DANG BCAS PA LA BLANG BYA DANG , MI DGE 'BRAS BU DANG BCAS LA DOR BYAR BYED PA'I SGO NAS TSUL BZHIN DU SGRUB PA LA RAG LAS SO, , MDOR NA SANGS

Generally speaking there are three kinds of faith: faith in the form of
admiration, faith in the form of belief, and faith in the form of hoping for
something. Here we are principally concerned with faith in the form of belief.
If you carry out your practice of the laws of cause and effect with a mistaken
idea about what you should and should not do, then you won't get the
protection of the Three Jewels. Contemplate well upon the workings of deeds and
their results, both white and black--meaning virtuous and non-virtuous. Take
up the practice of virtuous deeds and their consequences, and give up non-
virtuous deeds and their consequences.
You must do so since this achieving protection successfully depends on acting
properly. To put it briefly, you must first find belief in the statements of the
Buddha where He described the workings of deeds and their consequences
relating to virtue, non-virtue and so on. With this then you should carry out
the practice of taking up what is right, and giving up what is not.
The rest of the lines here, the ones that relate to the "venerable Lamas," are
easily understood.
The Foundation for Achieving the State of All-Knowing
The explanation of the foundation for achieving the state of all-knowing has
two points: the actual explanation, followed by notes on how to use the four
forces.
The actual explanation is found in these lines of the root text:

,LAM MCHOG SGRUB LA MTSAN NYID TSANG BA'I RTEN,
,MA RNYED BAR DU SA PHYOD MI 'ONG BAS,
,DE YI MA TSANG MED PA'I RGYU LA BSLAB,
(14a)
A life should possess all the features needed
to reach the supreme path;
And until you find such a body and mind
you won't make leaps and bounds.
Go then and learn all the causes which
prevent them from being incomplete.

,GSUM PA LA GNYIS, DNGOS DANG , STOBS BZHI BSTEN TSUL LO, , DANG PO NI, LAM MCHOG SGRUB LA SOGS TE, KHYAD PAR DU LAM MCHOG RNAM MKHYEN SGRUB PA LA TSE RING BA KHA DOG BZANG BA SOGS RNAM SMIN GYI RGYU BRGYAD SOGS MTSAN NYID TSANG BA'I RTEN CI RIGS PA MA RNYED KYI BAR DU LAM SGRUB KYANG SA CHOD MI 'ONG BAS, DE 'ONG BA'I CHED DU RTEN MTSAN NYID TSANG BA DE YI MA TSANG MED PA'I RGYU SGRUB PA LA BSLAB PAR BYA'O, , RGYU NI GZHAN GYI SROG SKYOB PA, RTEN LA MAR ME 'BUL BA SOGS MANG NGO , , DE'I TSE LAS 'BRAS LA BLANG DOR CI THUB BYAS KYANG , BAG MED PA DANG NYON MONGS MANG BA'I DBANG GIS NYES PA 'BYUNG BAS SO,
In order specifically to reach the supreme path--that is, the state of all-
knowing--you should have a life which possesses all the necessary features:
qualities such as those eight factors which ripen from your past deeds. These
eight include a long life, an attractive physical form, and so on. Until you can
find such a body and mind you may try to practice the path, but you will not be
able to make any leaps and bounds in your practice.
In order to get the kind of body and mind which has all those necessary
characteristics, you have to learn how to bring about the causes which would
prevent them from being incomplete. These causes are protecting others' lives and
making offerings of light at altars, among many others.
At this point you may be doing whatever you can to follow the rules of deeds
and their consequences, but because of carelessness or an attack of bad
thoughts you may make slip up. The way of practicing the four forces is thus
covered next in the root text:

,SGO GSUM SDIG LTUNG DRI MAS SBAGS PA 'DI,
,LHAG PAR LAS SGRIB SBYONG BA GNAD CHE BAS,
,RGYUN DU STOBS BZHI TSANG BAR BSTEN PA GCES,
,RNAL 'BYOR NGAS KYANG NYAMS LEN DE LTAR BGYIS,
,THAR 'DOD KHYED KYANG DE BZHIN BSKYANG 'TSAL LO,
(14b)
Polluted by downfalls and the stench of bad deeds
committed through all three doors,
It's crucial to purify yourself, especially of
the obstacles these deeds create.
You must then with great reverence depend
on the four forces, continually.
I, the master meditator,
lived my life this way;
You, who seek for freedom,
must try to do the same.

,GNYIS PA NI, SGO GSUM SDIG LTUNG SOGS TE, RANG CAG NI, LUS NGAG YID KYI SGO GSUM LAS NYON SPYI DANG KHYAD PAR RANG BZHIN GYI KHA NA MA THO BA'I SDIG PA DANG , BCAS PA'I KHA NA MA THO BA'I LTUNG BA'I DRI MAS SBAGS PA 'DI NI, LAS DANG NYON MONGS PA'I SGRIB PA GNYIS LAS LHAG PAR LAS KYI SGRIB PA SBYONG BA GNAD CHE BAS NA, DUS RGYUN TU RTEN GYI STOBS DANG , SUN 'BYIN PA'I STOBS, SLAR LDOG PA'I STOBS, GNYEN PO KUN TU SPYOD PA'I STOBS TE STOBS BZHI'I BSHAGS SDOM TSANG BAR BSTEN PAR GCES SO, , DRI MAS SBAGS PA 'DI ZHES GZHUNG MANG POR 'BYUNG BA LTAR BYAS LA, CHOS SPYOD DU NI 'DIS ZHES 'BYUNG NGO , , STOBS BZHI'I NGOS 'DZIN DANG BSHAGS TSUL RGYAS PAR GZHAN DU SHES PAR BYA'O, , RJE BTZUN BLA MAS SOGS SNGAR BZHIN NO,
In general people like you and me are full of mental afflictions and the bad
deeds which we have committed through all the three doors through which we
express ourselves: our body, speech, and mind. More specifically, we are
polluted by the stench of both those bad deeds which are wrong by their own
nature, and the downfalls or cases where we have transgressed the rules
established by the Buddha. It is crucial that you purify yourself of the two

different kinds of obstacles: those created by your bad deeds, those of your bad
thoughts.
This is especially true of the obstacles that bad deeds create. You must depend upon
all four of the forces involving confession and restraint, continually, in order to
achieve this purification. These four are the force of the basis, the force of
destruction, the force of turning away, and the force of the antidote. You
should follow these four with great reverence.
The wording of the line about being "polluted" as it appears here follows a
great number of versions of the text, and you should read it this way. Some
liturgical works include a different particle of grammar which would make it
sound like "purifying through the pollution."
You can find more details about each of the four forces, and the way in you
should do your confessions, by referring to other relevant texts. The refrain
here is the same as before.

Course IX: The Ethical Life
Reading Ten: Description of the Medium and Greater Capacities
The following reading consists of the third major section of the Song of My
Spiritual Life (Nyam mgur) of Je Tsongkapa (1357-1419). This text is also known
as The Short Book on the Steps of the Path (Lam-rim bsdus-don). Accompanying
the verses of Je Tsongkapa's root text is a commentary called Illumination of the
Essence (Snying-po mdor-bsdus gsal-ba), composed by Choney Lama Drakpa
Shedrup (1675-1748).
****************
THE PATH SHARED WITH PEOPLE OF MEDIUM CAPACITY

,GNYIS PA SKYES BU 'BRING DANG THUN MONG BA'I LAM NYAMS SU LEN TSUL GNYIS, SDUG KUN GNYIS KYI NYES DMIGS BSAM DGOS PA'I RGYU MTSAN DANG , BSAM TSUL DNGOS SO,
The method for putting into practice the steps of the path shared with people
of medium capacity has two parts: the reasons why it is necessary to
contemplate what's wrong with the truth of suffering and the truth of the
source of suffering; and then the actual contemplation.
WHY YOU MUST CONTEMPLATE
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE FIRST TWO TRUTHS
The reasons why it is necessary to contemplate what's wrong with the truths
of suffering and its source are indicated in the following verse of the root text:

,SDUG BDEN NYES DMIGS BSAM LA MA 'BAD NA,
,THAR PA DON GNYER JI BZHIN MI SKYE ZHING ,
,KUN 'BYUNG 'KHOR BA'I 'JUG RIM MA BSAMS NA,
,'KHOR BA'I RTZA BA GCOD TSUL MI SHES PAS,
(15a)
If you don't make efforts to contemplate
what's wrong with the truth of suffering,
You won't be able to develop as you should
the aspiration to be free.
And if you don't think of how the truth of the source
throws you into the cycle of life,
Then you won't understand the way to cut
the cycle of suffering from its root.

,DANG PO NI, SDUG BDEN NYES DMIGS SOGS TE, 'KHOR BA LAS THAR BAR 'DOD PAS THOG MAR SDUG KUN GNYIS KYI NYES DMIGS BSAM DGOS TE, NGAN SONG GSUM GYI SDUG BSNGAL DANG BDE 'GRO'I SDUG BSNGAL SPYI DANG BYE BRAG SKYE RGA NA 'CHI SOGS SDUG BSNGAL BDEN PAS BSDUS PA'I 'KHOR BA'I NYES DMIGS BSAM PA LA MA 'BAD NA NI, SDUG BSNGAL LAS THAR 'DOD MED PAR THAR PA DON GNYER GYI BLO JI LTA BA BZHIN MI SKYE ZHING , 'DOD CHAGS SOGS KYI NGO BO SKYE TSUL JI LTAR YIN PA'I KHYAD PAR SHES PA'I SGO NAS KUN 'BYUNG BDEN PA 'KHOR BA'I 'JUG RIM TU 'GRO TSUL MA BSAMS NA, 'BEN MA MTHONG BAR MDA' 'PHANGS PA BZHIN 'KHOR BA'I RTZA BA GCOD TSUL MI SHES PAS SO,
From the very beginning, those who wish to free themselves from cyclic
existence must contemplate what's wrong with the truth of suffering and the
truth of the source of suffering. The truth of suffering includes both the general
sufferings of the three lower realms and the higher realms, as well as the
specific sufferings of birth, old age, aging, sickness, death, and so on.
If you don't make great efforts to contemplate what's wrong with this cycle of
suffering, then you will not get any great wish to be free from suffering, and

you will not be able to develop the state of mind in which you aspire toward
freedom in the way that you should.
You must understand the details of the nature of desire and the other (mental
afflictions), and how they develop, because if you don't think about how the truth
of the source of suffering acts to throw you into the cycle of life, then you won't
understand how to cut the very root of the cycle of suffering. It would be like
shooting an arrow at a target you can't see.
THE ACTUAL CONTEMPLATION

,GNYIS PA LA GNYIS, SDUG BSNGAL 'KHOR BA'I NYES DMIGS DANG , KUN 'BYUNG GI 'KHOR BA'I 'JUG RIM BSAM PA'O,
The actual contemplation on the problems of the first two truths has two parts:
the contemplation on the truth of suffering--the problems of the cycle of life,
and the contemplation on the truth of the source of suffering--how it is that
we are thrown into this cycle of life.
The Contemplation on the Truth of Suffering
These lines of the root text indicate the contemplation of the truth of suffering:

,SRID LAS NGES 'BYUNG SKYO SHAS BRTAN PA DANG ,
(15b)
With a solid disgust for this existence
that definitely wants to get out,

,DANG PO NI, SRID LAS NGES 'BYUNG SOGS TE, 'KHOR BA'I GNAS SU SKYE RGA NA 'CHI BZHI DANG MYA NGAN DANG SMRE SNGAGS 'DON PA YID MI BDE BA DANG TSA GRANG 'THAB RTZOD SOGS KYI SDUG BSNGAL RNAMS MTHONG NAS SRID PA 'KHOR BA LAS NGES PAR 'BYUNG 'DOD KYI SKYO SHAS DRAG PO BSTEN PA DANG , 'CHAD 'GYUR LTAR SDUG BSNGAL DE BSKYED PA'I RGYU YANG SHES PAR BYA'O,
Look at all of the suffering in this circle of life; look at birth, aging, sickness
and death, at grief and crying out in pain, at our mental unhappiness, at the
heat and the cold, all the fighting, and on and on. Then with a fierce and solid
disgust for this existence that definitely wants to get out of the cycle of suffering
you must try to understand the cause which creates this suffering, as it will be
explained later in the text.
The Contemplation on the Truth of the Source
The contemplation on the truth of the source of suffering is expressed here in
the root text:

,'KHOR BAR GANG GIS BCINGS PA SHES PA GCES,
,RNAL 'BYOR NGAS KYANG NYAMS LEN DE LTAR BGYIS,
,THAR 'DOD KHYED KYANG DE BZHIN BSKYANG 'TSAL LO,
(15c)
Finding out about this suffering cycle
should be treated with great concern.
I, the master meditator,
put this into practice;
You, who seek for freedom, must
try to practice this way.

,GNYIS PA NI, 'KHOR BAR GANG GIS SOGS TE, 'KHOR BAR 'CHING BA BYED GANG GIS BCINGS PA SHES PA GCES PA STE GAL CHE'O, , 'CHING BYED LA LAS NYON GNYIS TE KHYAD PAR PHYE NA MANG YANG , DON BSGRIL NA SO SKYE'I RGYUD KYI 'DOD CHAGS KHONG KHRO NGA RGYAL MA RIG PA THE TSOM NYON MONGS CAN PHRAG DOG SOGS NYON MONGS THAMS CAD NI NYON MONGS PA'I KUN 'BYUNG BDEN PA YIN LA, NYON MONGS DES KUN NAS BSLANGS PA'I LAS DGE MI DGE GANG YIN KYANG LAS KYI KUN 'BYUNG BDEN PA YIN NO,
Finding out about what chains you to this suffering cycle should be treated as
something extremely important and with great concern. You are chained by
both your deeds and your bad thoughts. If we were to divide these out into
all of their different forms, there would be a great many of them. To state it
in a nutshell, the mental afflictions in the mindstream of a common
person--that is, desire, anger, pride, ignorance, bad forms of doubt, jealousy,
and so on--are all the truth of the source of suffering in the form of mental
afflictions, and the deeds which are motivated by them--both virtuous and
non-virtuous--are the truth of the source of suffering in the form of deeds.

,DE YANG GTZO BO MA RIG PA'I DBANG GIS LAS BSAGS LAS KYI DBANG GIS 'KHOR BAR 'JUG PA'I RTEN 'BREL YAN LAG BCU GNYIS KYI RIM PA LEGS PAR SHES SHING , MDOR NA LAS DANG NYON MONGS GNYIS KYI DBANG GIS 'KHOR BAR 'KHOR TSUL RNAMS BLA MA'I MAN NGAG LA BRTEN NAS SHES PA NI, KUN 'BYUNG 'KHOR BA'I 'JUG RIM SHES PA'O,
It is mainly because of our ignorance that we collect these deeds, and it is
because of the deeds themselves that we are thrown into the cycle of life. We
must gain a good understanding of all the steps in the twelve links of
dependent origination, through which this process takes place.
To put it briefly, you must rely on the personal instructions of a spiritual
guide, and thus come to realize how it is that your deeds and your bad
thoughts make you circle around in this cycle of life. Then you will
understand the truth of the source--the process through which you are thrown
into cyclic life.

,'KHOR BA'I RTZA BA GCOD TSUL NI BDAG MED RTOGS PA'I SHES RAB KYIS MA RIG PA'I ZHEN YUL LEGS PAR SUN PHYUNG BA'I TSUL GYIS GOMS PAR BYAS PA'I MTHAR MA RIG PA SPANGS PA NA 'KHOR BA'I RTZA BA BCAD CING , NYON MONGS GZHAN THAMS CAD KYANG ZHOR LA SBYONG BAR 'GYUR BA YIN NO,
The way to cut the very root of this cycle is with the wisdom which perceives
the lack of a "self." You use this wisdom to invalidate the object in which
ignorance believes, and by the time you familiarize yourself with this process
fully you are able to eliminate this ignorance, and thus cut the root of the cycle
of suffering. When ignorance is eliminated, all the other mental afflictions are
by the way removed themselves.

,SDUG KUN GNYIS KYI NANG NAS KUN 'BYUNG SPANGS NA SHING RTZA BA BCAD NA BSKAMS 'GRO BA LTAR SDUG BSNGAL YANG SPONG BAR 'GYUR BA GZHUNG CHEN PO RNAMS KYI DGONGS PA YIN MOD, DENG SANG GI LAS DANG PO BAS NI, NYON MONGS RTZA BA NAS SPONG MI NUS PAS, STOBS BZHI'I BSHAGS PA LA BRTEN NAS KUN 'BYUNG GI NANG TSAN SDIG LTUNG RNAMS SPONG BA GNAD CHE'O,
If between the pair of the truth of suffering and the truth of the source of
suffering you are able to eliminate the truth of the source, then you will also
be able to remove the truth of the source of suffering; if you cut the root of the
plant, for example, the plant itself dies.
Although this is the ultimate intent of the great scriptures, us spiritual begin-
ners nowadays are unable to eliminate our mental afflictions from their root.
It is therefore a very crucial point that we eliminate that part of the source of
suffering which is composed of our bad deeds and downfalls by using the
method of purification which involves the four forces.

,KHYAD PAR DU TSUL KHRIMS KYI BSLAB PA SOGS GSUM LA 'BAD DGOS LA, TSUL KHRIMS KYI BSLAB PA NI GTZO BO'I DBANG DU BYAS NA MI DGE BA BCU SPONG BA'I SPONG SEMS YIN LA, TING NGE 'DZIN GYI BSLAB PA'I GTZO BO NI ZHI GNAS YIN MOD, DER MA NGES TE DGE BA'AM YANG DAG PA'I DMIGS PA LA RING THUNG GANG YIN YANG RTZE GCIG TU GNAS PA'I SEMS PA RNAMS TING NGE 'DZIN GYI BSLAB PAS BSDUS SO,
Most especially we have to exert ourselves in the three trainings of morality,
[concentration, and wisdom.] The principal element involved in the training
of morality is the state of mind which wants to give up performing the ten bad
deeds. The principal element in the training of concentration is the high
meditative state called quietude, however it is not the only element involved.
The mental ability to place your mind one-pointedly for any length of time you
desire on some kind of pure or virtuous object is also included into the training
of concentration.

,SHES RAB KYI BSLAB PA'I GTZO BO NI LHAG MTHONG YIN KYANG , DER MA NGES TE, BDAG MED PHRA RAGS CI RIGS LA DPYOD PA'I RIGS PA DON MTHUN RNAMS DANG , CHOS KYI TSIG DON GZHAN LA'ANG LEGS PAR DPYOD PA'I SHES RAB RNAMS NI SHES RAB KYI BSLAB PAR 'DUS SO,
The main element in the training of wisdom is what we call "special vision,"
although it is not the only thing involved. Also included in the training of
wisdom is the intelligence which is able to examine, in a thorough way, the
correct reasonings which examine any of the varying levels of the lack of "self",
as well as the kinds of wisdom which examine the meanings of any Buddhist
texts or teachings.
THE ACTUAL PATH FOR PEOPLE OF GREATER CAPACITY

,GSUM PA SKYES BU CHEN PO'I LAM GYI RIM PA LA GNYIS, SPYOD PA'I RTEN SEMS BSKYED DANG , SPYOD PA LA BSLAB TSUL LO, , DANG PO LA GNYIS LAS, DANG PO KHYAD CHOS SAM PHAN YON NI, SEMS BSKYED THEG MCHOG SOGS BZHI STE,
The method for putting into practice the steps of the path for people of greater
capacity has two parts: developing the wish for enlightenment which is the
basis for bodhisattva activities, and then training yourself in the activities
themselves.
THE WISH FOR ENLIGHTENMENT
The explanation of the with for enlightenment, the basis of a bodhisattva's
activities, includes two sections.
Special Features or Benefits of the Wish for Enlightenment
First I will explain the special features, or benefits of the wish for
enlightenment, as expressed in the following lines of the root text:

,SEMS BSKYED THEG MCHOG LAM GYI GZHUNG SHING STE,
,RLABS CHEN SPYOD PA RNAMS KYI GZHI DANG RTEN,
,TSOGS GNYIS KUN LA GSER 'GYUR RTZI LTA BU,
,RAB 'BYAMS DGE TSOGS SDUD PA'I BSOD NAMS GTER,
(16a)
The wish for enlightenment is the central beam
which holds up the supreme way's path;
It's also the foundation and the basis
of a bodhisattva's mighty activity.
It is like the elixir of an alchemist
for both of the two great masses,
And a treasury of merit containing the collections
of a myriad number of virtues.

THEG CHEN SEMS BSKYED NI, THEG MCHOG LAM GYI GZHUNG SHING LTA BU STE, SBYIN DRUG SOGS RLABS CHEN SPYOD PA RNAMS KYI SKYE BA DANG GNAS PA DANG 'PHEL BA'I GZHI DANG RTEN YIN LA, BSOD NAMS DANG YE SHES KYI TSOGS GNYIS KUN RDZOGS BYANG DU SGYUR BAR BYED PA LA, LCAGS KHAMS GSER DU SGYUR BAR BYED PA'I GSER 'GYUR GYI RTZI LTA BU DANG , RAB 'BYAMS DGE TSOGS MANG PO SDUD PA'I BSOD NAMS KYI GTER CHEN PO'O, , GZHUNG 'DIS SEMS DE BSKYED DGOS PA'I RGYU MTSAN YANG BSTAN LA, GZHI DANG RTEN ZHES PAS THEG CHEN SEMS BSKYED DE, THEG  CHEN LAM GYI 'JUG SGOR YANG BSTAN TO, ,
The wish for enlightenment as it is found in the greater way is like the central
beam which holds up the path of the supreme way. It is the foundation and basis
which allows the mighty bodhisattva activities of giving, and the rest of the six
perfections, and other such activities to come into being, to remain, and
likewise to increase.
Like an alchemical elixir that acts to transform a piece of ordinary iron into gold,
this wish transforms both of the two great masses of merit and wisdom into total
enlightenment. It is also a great treasury which contains many great collections
of a myriad number of virtues.

In his text, Je Tsongkapa not only indicates the reasons why we must develop
the wish for enlightenment, but with the words "foundation and basis" he also
shows us that this wish for enlightenment as it is found in the greater way is
the very door for entering the path of the greater way.
