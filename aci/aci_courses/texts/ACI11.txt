Contemplation One
Anger destroys good karma

,BSKAL PA STONG DU BSAGS PA YI,
,SBYIN DANG BDE GSHEGS MCHOD LA SOGS,
,LEGS SPYAD GANG YIN DE KUN YANG ,
,KHONG KHRO GCIG GIS 'JOMS PAR BYED,
A single instance of anger
Destroys whatever good deeds
You may have amassed in thousands
Of eons spent in practices
Like giving, or making offerings
To Those Who have Gone to Bliss.

,ZHE SDANG LTA BU'I SDIG PA MED,
,BZOD PA LTA BU'I DKA' THUB MED,
,DE BAS BZOD LA NAN TAN DU,
,SNA TSOGS TSUL DU BSGOM PAR BYA,
There is no kind of deed
As evil as the act of anger;
There is no spiritual hardship
Like patience. Practice it then,
Concentrate on patience,
In many different ways.

KHONG KHRO'I NYES DMIGS DANG , BZOD PA'I PHAN YON BSAM PA'O, , DANG PO LA GSUM, MA MTHONG BA'I NYES DMIGS DANG , MTHONG BA'I NYES DMIGS DANG , NYES DMIGS BSDUS TE BSTAN PA'O, , DANG PO LA GNYIS, KHONG KHROS DGE RTZA 'JOMS PA DANG , KHRO BA DANG BZOD PA'I SKYON YON SHES NAS BZOD PA BSGOM PA LA 'BAD PAR BYA BA'O, , DANG PO NI,
We must contemplate upon the problems that anger causes, and upon the
benefits that come from patience. The problems we will cover in three steps:
those that we cannot see, those that we can see, and then a summary of the
problems. The problems that we cannot see will be presented in two parts:
how anger destroys our store of good karma, and advice to make efforts in the
practice of patience, once we have learned well the problems of anger and the
corresponding benefits of patience. Here is the first.

DGE BA'I CHOS RNAMS SKYE BA DANG GNAS PA'I GEGS BYED MTHAR THUG PA KHONG KHRO YIN PAS DE'I NYES DMIGS BSAMS NAS DE 'GOG PA LA BRTZON PAR BYA STE, BSKAL PA BRGYA DANG STONG DU

Anger is the ultimate obstacle that prevents the initial growth and then
continuation of every virtuous thing. As such we should contemplate upon the
problems it brings to us, and then make great efforts to stop it. This is because
of its effects on whatever good deeds you may have amassed in hundreds or
thousands of eons spent in practices like giving, or making offerings to Those Who
have Gone to Bliss (or to any of the other members of the Three Jewels), or
meditating, or maintaining an ethical way of life. A single instance of anger
focused upon a bodhisattva destroys all this virtue, from the root.

,DER MA ZAD THAMS CAD YOD SMRA'I SDE PAS 'DON PA'I LUNG BSLAB BTUS SU DRANGS PA LAS, DGE SLONG GIS DE BZHIN GSHEGS PA'I DBU SKRA DANG SEN MO'I MCHOD RTEN LA SEMS DAD PAS PHYAG BYAS PA'I LUS KYIS JI TZAM NON PA'I GSER GYI 'KHOR LO LA THUG PA'I BAR GYI RDUL GYI GRANGS JI SNYED YOD PA STONG 'GYUR GYI 'KHOR LO BSGYUR BA THOB PA'I DGE BA DE TSANGS PA MTSUNGS PAR SPYOD PA LA RMA BYUNG BAS 'JOMS PAR GSUNGS SO, , KHONG KHROS BSKAL PA BRGYA DANG STONG DU BSAGS PA'I DGE RTZA GCOD PA'I KHONG KHRO'I YUL LA BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA' DGOS PAR GSUNGS SO, , DE BZHIN DU DBU MA LA 'JUG PA LAS KYANG BSHAD DO,
Beyond all this is a quotation found in the Compendium of the Trainings, one
which is recited by the Buddhist group known as "Those Who Profess Them
All":
Suppose a monk, heart filled with devotion, prostrates himself
before an offering shrine containing the holy hair or fingernails
of One Who has Gone Thus. Imagine the number of atoms
contained in the ground which his body covers, going all the way
down into the planet up to the point where it touches the disk of
gold. Then imagine that each of these atoms represents the
amount of good karma required to attain a birth as the Emperor
of the Wheel, the King of the World. Now multiply all that by

a thousand. This is the amount of good karma which you
destroy by speaking badly of one of those persons who is
maintaining the pure way of life--that is, an ordained person.
It is stated, by the way, that for an instance of anger to destroy the store of
good karma that one has amassed over hundreds or thousands of eons, it must
be anger which is focused at a particular object: that is, at a bodhisattva. This
same point is described in Entering the Middle Way.

,GNAS MAL GZHI'I MGO'I 'DUL BA RGYA CHER 'GREL LAS, KHONG KHROS SDOM PA GCOD PAR BSHAD PA NI, KHONG KHRO STOBS CAN GYIS DGE RTZA BCAD PA LA BZHED PAR GSAL LO, , GZHAN YANG RTOG GE 'BAR BAR LOG LTA DANG GNOD SEMS KYIS DGE RTZA 'JOMS PAR BSHAD PAS KHONG KHRO SOGS BSRUNG BA LA 'BAD PAR BYA'O,
In the opening section of the Monastic Practices relating to Arrangements for
Housing there is also a discussion of the statement in the Extensive Commentary
on Vowed Morality where it says that anger can destroy your vows. This
discussion clarifies the fact that the statement refers to the destruction of stores
of good karma by anger of tremendous intensity. It is moreover stated in the
Blaze of Reasoning that one's store of good karma can be destroyed by wrong
view and by malice. Given all this, we must make great efforts to shield our
minds from anger and the rest.

,GNYIS PA NI, LAM SKYE BA'I GEGS BYED PA DANG DGE BA 'JOMS PA LA ZHE SDANG LTA BU'I SDIG PA MED LA, NYON MONGS KYI TSA GDUNG 'JOMS PA LA BZOD PA LTA BU'I DKA' THUB MED PA DE BAS NA BZOD PA BSGOM PA LA NAN TAN DU SGO DANG THABS SNA TSOGS KYI TSUL GYI BSGOM PAR BYA'O,
Here next is the advice. There is no kind of deed as evil as the act of anger for the
way in which it acts as an obstacle to prevent the growth of the spiritual path
within us, and destroys our good karma. Nor is there any spiritual hardship like
patience for breaking the relentless heat of the mental afflictions. You should
practice it then, concentrate on the practice of patience, and use the method of
finding many different ways, an entire variety of techniques, to do so.

Contemplation Two
Anger ruins our happiness and our relationships

,ZHE SDANG ZUG RNGU'I SEMS 'CHANG NA,
,YID NI ZHI BA NYAMS MI MYONG ,
,DGA' DANG BDE BA'ANG MI 'THOB LA,
,GNYID MI 'ONG ZHING BRTAN MED 'GYUR,
If you hold to the sharp pain
Of thoughts of anger, your mind
Can know no peace;
You find no happiness,
No pleasure. Sleep stays away,
And the mind remains unsettled.

,GANG DAG NOR DANG BKUR STI YIS,
,DRIN BYIN DE LA BRTEN GYUR PA,
,DE DAG KYANG NI SDANG LDAN PA'I,
,RJE DPON DE LA GSOD PAR RGOL,
Suppose there were a master
Who bestowed upon all those
Within his care both wealth
And honor as they wished;
Still they'd rise to kill him
If he lived in fury.

,DE YIS MDZA' BSHES SKYO BAR 'GYUR,
,SBYIN PAS BSDUS KYANG BSTEN MI BYED,
It leaves your friends and family
Tired of being with you;
They refuse to stay on even though
You may entice them with gifts.

,MDOR NA KHRO BA 'DIR GNAS PA,
,DE NI 'GA' YANG YOD MA YIN,
,KHRO BA'I DGRA YIS DE LA SOGS,
,SDUG BSNGAL DAG NI BYED PAR 'GYUR,
To put it simply,
There is no one with anger
Who can be happy.
Anger our enemy
Brings us these
And other pains as well.

,GNYIS PA LA GNYIS, KHONG KHROS LUS SEMS BDE BA'I SKABS MED PAR BYED PA DANG , MDZA' BSHES SOGS 'JOMS PAR BYED PA'O, , DANG PO NI, SDUG BSNGAL DRAG PO BSKYED PAS ZHE SDANG ZUG RNGU LTA BU'I SEMS 'CHANG NA YID NA SDUG BSNGAL ZHI BA'I DGA' BA NYAMS SU MI MYONG ZHING YID DGA' BA DANG , LUS BDE BA'ANG MI 'THOB LA GNYID MI 'ONG ZHING SEMS RNAL DU PHABS PA'I BRTAN PA'ANG MED PAR 'GYUR RO,
We will discuss the problems of anger that you can see in two parts: how
anger denies you any feelings of physical comfort or mental peace, and how
it destroys friends, relatives, and the like. Anger is like a sharp pain in that it
causes you a fierce feeling of suffering. If you hold to thoughts of it then your
mind can know none of the joy that one feels when he or she has reached the
peace where suffering is gone. A person with anger also finds no happiness
mentally, nor any pleasure in the body. Sleep stays away, and the mind remains
unsettled, off balance.

,GNYIS PA NI, KHONG KHRO CAN GANG DAG NOR DANG BKUR STI YIS DRIN BYIN TE BSKYANGS PA PHAN BYED DE LA BRTEN PAR GYUR PA DE DAG KYANG NI ZHE SDANG DANG LDAN PA'I RJE DPON DE LA GSOD PAR RGOL BA YOD DO,
Suppose there were a master of an estate who bestowed upon all those within his care
both wealth and honor as they wished; that is, who supported them, and gave

them every help. Still if the master were the kind of person who lived
constantly in the emotion of fury, then even these dependents would rise against
him, and kill him.

,KHONG KHRO DE YIS MDZA' BSHES KYANG YID SUN NAS SKYO BAR 'GYUR LA SBYIN PAS BSDUS KYANG DGA' BAS BSTEN PAR MI BYED PAS DE SPONG BA LA 'BAD PAR BYA'O,
It--meaning anger--leaves your friends and family tired of being with you, since
you cause them so much trouble. Even though you may try to entice them with
gifts, they will find it no pleasure to be around you, and will refuse to stay. This
again is a reason why you should put forth great efforts to eliminate this state
of mind.

,GSUM PA NI, MDOR NA KHRO BAS BDE BAR GNAS PA DE NI 'GA' YANG YOD PA MA YIN PAS DES NA KHRO BA'I DGRA YIS SNGAR BSHAD PA'I NYES DMIGS DE LA SOGS PA 'DI PHYI'I SDUG BSNGAL DAG NI BYED PAR 'GYUR BA'I RGYU PHUL DU PHYIN PA'O,
To put it simply, there is no one with anger who can be happy, and so it is that our
enemy, anger, brings us pains in the form of the problems just mentioned, and
others as well--it is the perfect way to suffer.

Contemplation Three
Anger begins with being upset, and it is useless ever to be upset

,YID MI BDE BA'I ZAS RNYED NAS,
,ZHE SDANG BRTAS TE BDAG 'JOMS SO,
Anger feeds on the food
Of feeling upset, then strengthened
Turns to smash me.

,DE LTAS BDAG GIS DGRA BO DE'I,
,ZAS NI RNAM PAR GZHOM PAR BYA,
And so then I will smash
The sustenance that feeds
This enemy of mine.

,'DI LTAR BDAG LA GNOD PA LAS,
,DGRA 'DI LA NI LAS GZHAN MED,
My foe knows no other
Kind of work at all

Here is the first point, on the nature of the causes of anger, and the problems
they bring. "Just how is it," one may ask, "that anger leads me to suffering?"
Consider the emotion of becoming upset, when something you don't want to
happen does happen, either to you, or to someone or something you consider
yours. Consider this same emotion when something happens to prevent you
from getting what you do want. This feeling upset is a kind of food that anger
feeds upon. When anger finds this food, its body is strengthened--fortified--and
then it turns to smash me, in both this and my future lives.

Here next is the point about making efforts in the methods of stopping anger.
And so then I will smash the emotion of feeling upset, the sustenance that feeds this
enemy of mine, this anger. I will put all my effort into destroying my anger,
who is worst of foes, for he knows no other kind of work at all except to cause me
pain.

The third point, on the actual methods for stopping anger, has two parts: a
description of how very wrong it is to become upset, and then the reasons why
it is so wrong. Here is the first.
"How can I get rid of the emotion of being upset?" you may ask. You should
first contemplate the benefits of learning to accept suffering gladly. Then you
must learn to think to yourself, clearly, "No matter what happens, I will never
allow my joy to be disturbed." Joy is the antidote for feeling upset; and no matter
what happens that you don't like, doing something which is non-virtuous in
return cannot accomplish your hopes, and only makes you lose the goodness that you
do have, the goodness that can in fact produce the result you are hoping for.
If this happens, then every other sort of suffering will come as well.

,GNYIS PA NI, GANG LA YID MI BDE SKYE BA'I YUL DE LA GAL TE BCOS SU YOD NA NI DE LA MI DGA' BAR BYA BA'I RGYU CI ZHIG YOD, DE MA THAG BCOS PAS YID MI BDE BA MED PAR 'GYUR BA'I PHYIR RO, , GAL TE BCOS SU MED NA YANG DE LA MI DGA' BA BYAS PAS CI PHAN TE NAM MKHA' THOGS BCAS KYIS STONG PA LA MI DGA' BA BYAS KYANG MI PHAN PA BZHIN NO,
Let us consider any of the objects over which we feel upset. If there is
something you can do about it, then why should you ever feel upset at all? You
could take the necessary action to fix it immediately, and never need to feel
upset. If on the other hand there is nothing you can do about it, then what is the
use of being upset? It would be as useless as getting upset at empty space, at
a place where nothing was.

Contemplation Four
Perfect patience is like any other habit, and can be developed with practice

,GOMS NI SLA BAR MI 'GYUR BA'I,

,DE BAS GNOD PA CHUNG GOMS PAS,

There is nothing in the world
Which does not come easily
If you make a habit of it;
Make then a habit
Of bearing the small pains,
And thus endure the greater.

Here is the first point, which is establishing that patience is easy to rely upon
once you have accustomed yourself to it. If you make a habit of patience, then
you will be able to endure any kind of suffering. The way we think of
anything is based primarily on how we have become accustomed to think, on
our mental habits. As such there is nothing in the world--that is, no quality of
the mind--which does not come easily if you make a habit of it.

For this reason then you should learn to think this way: "Suppose I can bear, and
learn to accept gladly, the small pains--things like feeling too hot or too cold,
or else situations like having someone say something unpleasant to me. If I

make a habit of this, I will thus be able to endure the greater pains as well: things
like the fire of the hell-worlds, and so on.

The sutra entitled The Meeting of the Father and the Son describes this in greater
detail, for example in a section that begins:
Oh Victorious One, there is a kind of concentration called "living
in happiness over everything that is." Any bodhisattva who
attains this type of concentration feels a sensation of pleasure,
and only pleasure, whenever they focus on any object at all; they
never feel any kind of unpleasantness...
The sutra then continues with,
. . . These types of persons could even be assailed by the
sufferings of the realms of hell, and yet still maintain their
perception of it as pleasure.

Contemplation Five
Patience is a decision, a state of mind

Here is the fourth point, where an example is presented to show how, once
you have accustomed yourself to it, patience can be made very powerful.
There are some kinds of people, warriors, who when they catch sight of their own
blood after another person has struck them with a weapon are incited, and rise
to a higher level of ferocity in the battle. There are also some other types,
cowards, who when they see even someone else's blood faint and fall unconscious.
These reactions are not something which depends upon any distinction such
as the relative force of the external blow, or the amount of resilience to the
blow exhibited by the body. Rather all of this derives from something in the
mind, either steadfastness or cowardice. Therefore we should exert ourselves in
learning to practice the kind of patience where we can take suffering upon
ourselves gladly.

Next is a summary on the points mentioned above. For these reasons then we
should learn to make our minds tough, and to disregard the harms that come to
us: never allow any type of pain to touch you. Feelings of hurt may come, but those
who are wise--in the sense of being skilled in the greater way--should never
let anger cloud the clarity of their mind, no matter what sufferings they may meet
with.

We are locked in combat
With mental affliction, and in war

Here is the fourth point, on the benefits of making efforts to eliminate your
mental afflictions. We are locked in combat with mental affliction, with thoughts
such as anger and the like, things which we seek to eliminate from our minds.

And in a war, many wounds, many sufferings, are sustained. In the world a man
or woman is counted a warrior if they can ignore the pains that come as others
strike their body, and continue on to slay their foe.
We on the other hand are learning to ignore any kind of pain that might ever
come in body or in mind, and to go on to smash the foes of our mental afflictions,
anger and such. The act of conquering these mental afflictions is the thing that
makes you a true warrior; the rest don't deserve to be called warriors, because it
is the same as if they were only killing corpses--they are slaying people who,
even if someone hadn't killed them, would have died on their own anyway, by
the very nature of things.

Course XI: Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life, Part II
Reading Two: Contemplations on the Perfection of Patience,
Part II
The following contemplations are based on the Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way
of Life (Bodhisattvacharyavatara; Byang-chub-sems-dpa'i spyod-pa la 'jug-pa) of the
Buddhist master Shantideva (circa 700 AD), and the commentary upon it by
Gyaltsab Je Darma Rinchen (1364-1432) entitled Entry Point for Children of the
Victorious Buddhas (rGyal-sras 'jug-ngogs). The relevant sections are found at
folios 15B-16B and 61A-64B, respectively, in the ACIP electronic editions
TD3871 and S5436.
The content of the contemplations is translated directly from the root text and
commentary; the names of the contemplations are not a part of the original
text, but are based on the divisions of Gyaltsab Je's commentary and have been
supplied for reference. Each lesson is accompanied by the full detailed outline
for the section from Gyaltsab Je's commentary.

Despite themselves; no one says,

Here is the first point, where we cover the reasons why it is improper to feel
anger towards people who have mental afflictions. "It is right," you may begin,
"to be angry at another person, since they have hurt me." And yet it is not
right, for you fail to feel anger for bile and such, these things which when they fall
out of balance are major sources of pain for you. Why then are you angry only at
those with minds--that is, with living beings?

"But it's not the same," you may object. "Bile and the rest do not occur of their
own accord, but rather due to other influences. This is why I do not feel angry
at them." In that case then it is very wrong for you to become angry at people
either, because they too are all impelled by other influences--that is, by their
mental afflictions--and are not acting out of their own accord.

Illness for example is something which occurs when all the conditions are there for
it to occur, despite the fact that we never wished it to. Just so the arrival of anger
is something we never wanted; mental afflictions occur when the causes for
them--unhappiness and the like--press upon us violently. If you're going to
get mad then, you should do so at the mental afflictions; it is wrong for you
to be angry at the person.

Here is the second point, a demonstration that anger is not something which
is felt at will. "But other people," you may object, "are not the same as the
mental afflictions you've mentioned, for people do harm to me intentionally."
No one though goes around saying, "I think I'll get angry now, I think I will see
that all the causes for anger come and make it start now." Anger rather wells

up in people despite themselves, almost randomly, whenever the causes for it are
all present; it starts without anyone saying, "I think I'll start it, get angry, right
now." All the same though anger comes then; at this point we've no self-control
of ourselves.
The last verse is also explained by dividing it into halves, with the first half
referring to the influences that bring about the person who is angry, and the
second half referring to those that bring about the mental affliction of anger.

Here is the first point, a refutation of the idea that the primal One could
produce all the expressions of the world on its own accord. Consider now this
thing that they believe in called the "primal One," which is supposed to be made
of equal parts of Particle, Darkness, and Courage, and is supposed to have five
different qualities. They say it does, on its own accord, create harms and other
such things, all included into what are considered its "expressions."
Or consider the supposed "Self-Existent Being," otherwise known as the "Original
Mental Being," which is said to experience its objects on its own accord.
Neither of these though could be real, for the "Self-Existent Being" and the
"primal One" never came about by thinking to themselves, all by themselves, "Now
I should occur, for a specific purpose--so that I can experience objects, or create
my expressions." But in fact they could never make anything occur, they
could never actually do anything, no more than the horns on a rabbit's head
could.

Let's consider what it is that you think can grow then, at the point when the
primal One is supposed to produce some result. It would be completely
mistaken to believe that the One could produce any result, at all, since this One
itself never grew from anything in the first place. And this must absolutely be
the case, because it is logically impossible for anything to produce a result, it
cannot be, if that thing--that is, because that thing--was such that it never grew
itself.

Here is the second point, a refutation of the idea that the Original Mental Being
could experience objects on its own accord. Let us consider this Original
Mental Being. Isn't it true then that it would be a thing that could never have
a time when it was not experiencing its object, that never did come to an
end--that is, never could come to an end with each experience? This is because
(1) you believe it to be an unchanging but functional thing which experiences
its objects; and (2) if it were such a thing, then it must forever shift its focus to
its object. And if this were the case, then it would be impossible for there to
ever be a time when it were not holding to its object.
The second point here is a refutation of the idea that the self-existent being
accepted by the Logicalists could ever exist of its own accord. Here there are
three separate steps: a demonstration that it is incorrect to think that an
unchanging thing could ever produce a result; a demonstration that it is
incorrect to think that this same thing could rely upon some other influence;
a demonstration that this same thing could never share a relationship with
some influence. Here is the first.

The Logicalists believe in a self-existent being that is both something physical
and also an unchanging thing that can perform a function. They say then that
it creates those things that do us harm. But isn't it obvious, isn't it very clear,
that if this Self were an unchanging thing which could perform a function, then
it would be like empty space, and could never act to do something like producing
an effect?

Here is the second step. One may respond with the following: "Although this
Self is by its nature unchanging, it produces results when it encounters certain
influences." And yet it is impossible for an unchanging thing to encounter an
influence; and even if it did happen due to its encountering some other influences,
such as the will that something happen or the like, then how could these things,
these influences, act on something changeless? It could never have any effect
upon it at all, because this Self is changeless.
This logic is inescapable, because when they--any particular influences--did
affect this Self in any way, then the Self would never budge, it would never
change to have any other nature than it already had: it would stay exactly as it
was before. And if the Self never changed, then doing something to it would do
nothing; there wouldn't be the slightest difference between the way it was and
the way it is.

Here is the third step. Someone may respond again, with the following: "Even
though the Self doesn't affect anything else in a way that alters its basic nature,
it does affect things in a way that is peripheral to itself." This too though is
completely incorrect. Where is something you can point to at all and say that this
is the peripheral effect, this is what the Self does in creating its result, that could
have any kind of relationship with it? No relationship is possible, for there is
neither the relationship of identity, nor the relationship of origination.

Here is the third point from before, which is an explanation of why it is
improper to feel anger once you have understood that all beings are like a
magical show. And so it is that everything in the production of a result depends
on other influences, while these influences depend themselves on other, previous
causes and influences, they on theirs, and so on. In a sense then it is inevitable
whether a particular result will come out or not, it is all up to the causes, and
so these things are like a magical show, like pictures of illusion. You must
understand this fact, that each and everything which does something is empty
of any nature of its own, and yet still functions perfectly well. If you do so,
then you will feel no anger towards any of these things that are like pictures of
illusion. Thus you must train yourself in the realization of the fact that
dependent origination has no nature of its own, for it is this realization which
destroys the very seeds of mental affliction.

Here is the first point, which is how some people, out of their own ignorance,
even do harm to themselves. Let's consider the kinds of people who hurt other
people. There are those who, having lost their senses, having lost control due to
their mental afflictions, hurt even themselves by themselves. Some, thinking it

will lead them to some kind of nirvana, do all kinds of harm to themselves:
they roll around in beds of thorns, jump from cliffs, and do other such things.
Others, to get a woman or money or the like, start becoming obsessed, and out of
anger then do things like refusing to eat food. Some others, oppressed by their
mental afflictions, go and hang themselves, or leap from cliffs, or swallow poison or
other harmful things. Others go and hurt themselves, in both this and their future
births, by living in a way against the virtuous life, in a way that they commit
many bad deeds which will lead them to the lower realms. Therefore it is
impossible to justify your anger by saying that it is because you have been
harmed by someone else.

Here is the second point, which describes how it is no great surprise that
people do harm to others, since these ignorant ones even kill themselves. If
people driven to it because of their mental afflictions even kill their own selves, so dear
and precious to them, then what surprise could it ever be to see that they also act
in ways that harm the bodies of other people? We should realize that this fits their
way of life well, and thus understand how wrong it is to be angry with them.

Here is the third point, which demonstrates why it is, therefore, quite
appropriate that we should feel compassion for such people. Thus do people
live, as described above, doing harm to others and committing acts like suicide
because they are overpowered by their mental afflictions.
They are truly worthy of our pity, and if by some chance you cannot feel some of
this pity for them, then at the least withold your anger: realize how totally wrong
it is to be angry with them.

Contemplation Ten
If people are harmful by nature, it is no surprise
when they hurt us;
if they are only harmful at moments,
we should bear with them

,GAL TE GZHAN LA 'TSE BYED PA,

And if the nature of living beings
Is to be thoughtful, then all their faults
Are occasional, and being angry with them
Is wrong too, wrong as hating

Here is the first point, which describes how inappropriate it is to be angry,
since it is the nature of children to be themselves. Now if it is the very nature
of those who are children--of children who don't know what is right or wrong,
or who are undergoing an attack of mental affliction at the moment--to do
harm to others, then being angry with them is wrong, as wrong as hating fire, and
being furious with fire, for the fact that it burns, something which is its very
nature as well.

,GNYIS PA NI, 'ON TE GZHAN LA 'TSE BA'I SKYON 'DI GLO BUR DU BYUNG LA SEMS CAN GYI RANG BZHIN MDZANGS SHING NGES PA YIN NA'ANG , 'O NA'ANG GNOD BYED LA KHRO BAR MI RIGS TE MAN MKHA' LA GLO BUR DU DUD PA 'THUL NA NAM MKHA' LA ZHE BKON ZHING SKAM PA MI RIGS PA BZHIN NO,
And here is the second point, which covers how inappropriate it would be to
feel anger even if the problem of the harm they do to you were just something
incidental. Or suppose then that this fault of tending to hurt other people is
just something that happens occasionally; that is, what if the basic nature of living
beings is to be wise, and thoughtful. Even then too it would be wrong to be angry
with them, as wrong as hating or feeling irritated by a puff of smoke that just
happened to appear in the sky for a moment.

Contemplation Eleven
Should we be angry at sticks?

,DBYUG PA LA SOGS DNGOS BKOL TE,
,GAL TE 'PHEN PA LA KHRO NA,
,DE YANG ZHE SDANG GIS SBAD PAS,
,NYES NA ZHE SDANG LA KHRO RIGS,
It's the stick or whatever
That delivers directly; if you're angry
At what impels it,
Then get mad if you really must
At anger itself, since it's the force
That sets the other into motion.

"But it is right for me to be angry," one may insist, "because the other person
has hurt me." Now if you are going to be angry at what hurt you directly,
then you should feel anger for the stick or the weapon or whatever it was that
delivered the injury directly, since they are what caused the pain. Or suppose
you say that you're not going to get angry at the stick or whatever, since it
didn't act on its own accord, but rather at what made it move: at the person
who impelled the stick. This other person though is not acting on his own accord
either; rather, he himself is set into motion by the force of anger. So if you really
must be angry--if you have no choice, if you cannot help yourself--then you
should get mad at anger itself.

Here is the first point, which is the contemplation that it is your own fault
when others do you harm. I myself in days gone by--that is, in my previous
lives--perpetuated on other living beings this very same harm as the one which is
happening to me now. And so it is right that now the one who did the harm--that
is, myself--should have this same hurt come to him. Think this way to yourself,
and learn to practice patience.

Now comes the second point, which concerns the fact that your own grasping
to your body is one of the problems which causes your suffering. Here is yet
another reason why it is completely wrong for you to feel anger. The weapons
of these other people and this body of mine, both of them, provide the causes for the
pain that has come to me. The way it happened is that they produced the
weapons, and I produced the body: and it took both of them to create my
suffering. At which of the two then should I be angry? It's hardly fair that I
should only be angry at the others.

My body, filled with suffering, is a great blister in the shape of a man, and it is
unbearable if someone touches it in the slightest way. It's me who, driven by desire
and with the eyes of my intelligence blinded by ignorance, grasps to it, and so
I myself can be destroyed by something as insignificant as a thorn. So when
someone harms this body, who deserves my anger? I should learn to think to
myself how it's all my own fault.

,GSUM PA NI, BYIS PA RNAMS SDUG BSNGAL MI 'DOD CING SROG GCOD SOGS SDUG BSNGAL GYI RGYU LA BRKAM ZHING SRED PAS NA SNGAR GYI RANG GI NYES PAS 'PHANGS NAS 'BRAS BU RANG LA GNOD PA BYUNG BAR GYUR PA LA, GZHAN LA BKON TU CI ZHIG YOD RANG GI NYES PA 'BA' ZHIG GIS BYAS PA'O,
Next is the third point, which treats the fact that my own attachment to the
causes of suffering in past lives has also created the problem. Children want no
suffering, but at the same time then they thirst for--they crave--the things that bring
them pain, actions like killing and the rest. If suffering comes to me because it is
sent to me by some wrong deed I myself have done in the past, then why
should I feel hate for others? It's my own fault, and my fault only, that all of this
is happening.

Take for example the guards of the hell realms, and places there like the forests
filled of trees that have leaves which are made of the blades of swords. There were
not intentionally constructed there by some other person. Rather, every one of
them was created by the deeds I did myself. The sufferings that come to me in this
present life are the same, and created by my own past deeds. So who then
deserves my anger? Again it is all my own fault only, and so from this moment
on I will do all I can to give up the things that cause me suffering.

Course XI: Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life, Part II
Reading Three: Contemplations on the Perfection of Patience,
Part III
The following contemplations are based on the Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way
of Life (Bodhisattvacharyavatara; Byang-chub-sems-dpa'i spyod-pa la 'jug-pa) of the
Buddhist master Shantideva (circa 700 AD), and the commentary upon it by
Gyaltsab Je Darma Rinchen (1364-1432) entitled Entry Point for Children of the
Victorious Buddhas (rGyal-sras 'jug-ngogs). The relevant sections are found at
folios 16B-15A and 19A-74B, respectively, in the ACIP electronic editions
TD3871 and S5436.
The content of the contemplations is translated directly from the root text and
commentary; the names of the contemplations are not a part of the original
text, but are based on the divisions of Gyaltsab Je's commentary and have been
supplied for reference. Each lesson is accompanied by the full detailed outline
for the section from Gyaltsab Je's commentary.

Assuming I am able to control my own thoughts, the mind could never be
overcome by anyone at any point at all using harsh words or weapons or the like,
because it is not a thing that has a body.
And it's true that you could say, "I relate to my body so strongly--that is, due
to the fact that I grasp to it so strongly--that I get angry when all these many
pains do harm to it." And yet when someone criticizes you, or says some harsh
things to you, their words with their unpleasant sound can do not even the least
physical harm to you. Why is it then, my mind, that you feel such fury? It's
completely wrong to feel any anger.

Here is the first point, which covers the reasons why it is wrong to feel anger
at those who are doing harm to holy images and the like. Someone may make
the following argument: "I can admit that it is wrong to feel anger for someone
who has hurt me personally. But there is nothing wrong with getting angry
at those who have harmed the Three Jewels." Suppose though that someone
expresses themselves, speaking against sacred images of the Buddhas, the shrines
of great bodhisattvas and the like, or else the holy Dharma. Or suppose that they
even act bodily to try to destroy these things. It's completely wrong for me to feel
anger even at these kinds of people, since the Buddhas and such, the Three Jewels,
cannot be hurt. In fact, the one who attempts to harm them is someone who
deserves our pity, and so it is more appropriate to feel love for them. The point
here is that the Three Jewels are incapable of sustaining any kind of injury
brought about by mental discomfort due to feeling upset.

Here is the second point, which is why it is appropriate to practice, in the same
way, patience for those who do harm to those who are close to us. Even too
when you see someone hurting another, when persons do harm to the Lamas that
are teaching you the Dharma; or else to the relatives or the like with whom you
share a family relationship [reading rus for dus in the commentary]; and to those
who are your friends, it is wrong to feel anger. This is because of the fact that,
in the way that was explained before, what is happening to them has all come
about through certain causes: that is, through their own past karma--the injuries
are dictated by the karma come from the wrongs that these relatives and so on
committed themselves before. And you should turn back your own anger by
seeing this fact.

Here is the first point, which covers the reasons why it is appropriate to hope
that someone will sing the praises of our enemies, since this can cause us to be
happy ourselves. Suppose that any particular person praises another, our enemy,
by saying, "They have certain good qualities." And suppose that he--meaning
the one who does the praising--derives some kind of joy from doing so. Why is
it, my mind, that you don't then sing the praises of this person yourself, and find the
very same joy as the other has already?
If you did, then the happiness of taking this joy in the good qualities of others
would become an irreproachable source of happiness for you yourself in the
future; the joy has been admitted--that is, praised--by all of those who possess high
qualities (which refers to the victorious Buddhas and their sons and daughters)
as being something which provides exactly this kind of source. This kind of
behavior is also the very best method for gathering other disciples.

,GNYIS PA LA GNYIS, GZHAN BDE BA MI 'DOD NA RANG GI BDE BA NYAMS PAR 'GYUR BA DANG , DES NA GZHAN BDE BA 'DOD RIGS PA'O, , DANG PO NI,
Here is the second point, which is why it is inappropriate not to hope for this
to happen, since it causes the other person--the one being praised--to be
happy. There are two steps to this point itself: the fact that, if we wish against
the happiness of others, it causes our own happiness to decline; and why it is,
therefore, right to hope for the happiness of others. Here is the first.

GAL TE GZHAN LA BSTOD PA BSTOD YUL GZHAN YANG DE LTAR BDE BAR 'GYUR RO ZHES GAL TE KHYOD GZHAN BSTOD PAS BDE BA 'DI MI 'DOD NA RANG GI BRAN SOGS LA GLA RNGAN BYIN PAS DE BDE BAR 'GYUR BAS GLA RNGAN BYIN PA SOGS KYANG SPANG DGOS PAS DE LA SOGS PA SPANGS PA'I PHYIR, TSE 'DIR BRAN GYIS LAS MI BYED CING PHYI MAR BDE BA MI MYONG BA MTHONG BAS TSE 'DI DANG , MA MTHONG BA PHYI MA'I BDE BA NYAMS PAR 'GYUR RO,
Now what if instead you say to yourself, "But now he"--meaning the person who
is the object of the act of praising--"will be as happy as well;" that is, suppose
that you hope against this happiness which occurs in the person being praised.

In this case then you should deny any wages earned by your own employees, and
all like kinds of behavior, since these wages and so on make these people
happy.
And if you do deny the wages and so on, you will find that, in this current life,
your employees refuse to work for you. In your future lives too, this behavior
will prevent you from experiencing any happiness. Thus it is that this way of
acting comes to make you fail in your search for happiness, in both the "seen"
(which refers to your present life) and the "unseen" (which refers to your future
lives).

Here is the second step. When someone else praises my own good qualities, it is
my hope that this other person--meaning the one who is doing the
praising--might thereby find some happiness. But at the same time I have no hope
or wish that I myself (the one doing the praising now) should ever find this same
happiness, the happiness which comes from praising others. This kind of attitude
is very wrong, very contradictory, and I should therefore try to praise others,
and feel joy over it, in exactly the way that I hope that others will feel
happiness whenever they sing my own praises.

Here is the second overall point, which is to give up any feeling of being
unable to tolerate those people who bring happiness to our enemies. By my
hope that I could bring every living being to the experience of matchless happiness,
I've developed the wish for enlightenment, and pledged to train myself in the
activities of a bodhisattva. When any one of these living beings finds some minor
happiness by himself, my wishes have been accomplished. Why on earth then does
it make you angry, my mind, when this happens? The proper thing would be
to feel joy.

The first point, which is why it is wrong to feel that we cannot tolerate things
that block the harms which we wish upon our enemies, has three parts of its
own: why disliking our enemies does no help to us; why hoping to harm out
enemies does no harm to our enemies; and why it does hurt ourselves. Here
is the first. Suppose you say, "If something happens to hurt my enemy, I feel
glad; and if something happens to block these harms which I wish upon my
enemy, I feel angry." But even should your enemy become upset, and unhappy,
how then could you feel glad about it? It does absolutely no good to you, and in
fact only hurts you.

Here is the second point. Suppose you think to yourself, "I wish something
could happen to hurt my enemy." But it's not that some kind of harm has come
to him or her all caused by your hopes and wishes. Nothing that you hope for in
your own life has been accomplished to the least degree at all. As such it is
very wrong for you to feel anger.

Here is the third point, which has two parts of its own: why it is wrong to be
glad when harm comes to our enemies; and why, if we maintain such a feeling
of gladness, it turns into a cause that will produce massive suffering for none
other than ourselves. We begin with the first.

Suppose you think to yourself, "I wish something bad would happen to my
enemy." But even should the suffering you wished on them come to pass, what's
there to be glad at? This would not result in the tiniest benefit to you yourself.

Here is the second. And if you say, "It satisfies me when I see something happen
that harms my enemy, for my wishes have been fulfilled," then consider the
following. What better method could you ever find to ruin yourself, to send
yourself to the lower realms, than to allow yourself an intense emotion of
malice like this?

Think for example of fishermen, who use their iron hooks to jab or catch a fish.
The mental affliction of anger is like the fisherman, and the hook that he jabs in
us is the iron barb of negative karma created by an intense emotion of malice.
His hook is unbearable, and merciless; it is certain to catch me, and should it do
so then it's a certainty that the guards of hell will keep me captive in--throw me
into--their hell-realm "cauldrons," which refers to containers filled with molten
metal.

Here is the first point, which is that exceptional objects of virtue are extremely
rare. Objects towards which you can practice your patience are much more
rare than those towards which you can practice your charity, so the right thing
to do would be to feel joy when you find them. Now the world may be full of
beggars, but finding someone to do me harm is truly a rare occurrence. Why so?
This is true since there could never be a person who did any hurt to me in any way
at all if I did not do any hurt to them first.

Here is the second point: why it is right to be glad about those who block us
from accomplishing merit. Think about the rarity of objects towards which
you can practice patience. Now suppose that, without an ounce of effort, I came
across a treasure chest that had been hidden in my house. My enemies are just the
same: I should thus feel joy for them, by reflecting about how grateful I feel for
the aid they give me when they provide me with objects towards which I can
practice the activities of a bodhisattva, in the form of people towards whom I can
develop patience.

Here is the third point, which is why it is right to feel the desire to be of
benefit to these persons. Since he--my enemy--and I both bring about "it" (the
practice of patience), both can be included into the cause which brings about
the patience. And for this reason then it's fitting that from the outset itself I
devote or dedicate to him, to the one who hurts me, the final result that comes
from being patient; that is, enlightenment. The point here is that he, my enemy,
has in the way described provided something for me to be patient about, and this will
act as a very powerful cause for the patience which allows me to reach
enlightenment itself.

Here is the first point, which covers how scripture itself states that living
beings and Buddhas are equivalent as objects towards which to perform merit.
It is absolutely necessary that we honor living beings; and this is why the sutra
entitled The Excellent Collection of Dharma Teachings states that--
The field of living beings is the field of the Buddhas; and it is
from this field of the Buddhas that all the high qualities of the
Buddhas are attained. To attempt the opposite is completely
wrong.
The Able One is here describing how the field of living beings is a place to plant
vast seeds of merit: he is calling this the "field of the Victorious Buddhas," in the
sense that sentient beings are similar to the Teacher himself in how they
provide a field for collecting great merit.

This brings us to the second part, where we establish this point with logic as
well. Here there are two steps: how, by having faith in both the Buddhas and
all living beings, we can reach our ultimate dreams; and why it is wrong to
discriminate between them, since they are equivalent from the point of view
that, by having faith in both, we can reach enlightenment. Here is the first.

It is right to pay honor to every living being, because many persons who felt
faith towards them--towards both Buddhas and living beings--and who
succeeded in pleasing both were able in this way to reach the perfection of the
ultimate: that is, the culmination of both their own needs and those of others.

Here is the second step. For the reasons just stated, the qualities of an
Enlightened One--that is, the powers of a Buddha and so on, the final result
of our practice--are attained by means of both fields: that of living beings and
of the Victorious Buddhas, alike. Why then do you act this way, in this manner,
saying "I refuse to honor other beings in the way that I do the Victors." It is
completely wrong.

There is moreover yet another reason that we should pay honor to every living
being. The Buddhas are persons who act as closest friends to a limitless number
of living things: they are driven to do so by their great compassion, even
though they may never be impelled or bidden to do so in any normal sense.
And in their actual actions they accomplish infinite degrees of help for these
beings as well. And there is only one way to truly repay their kindness: what
better method could there be to do so, than to please all living beings?

lose faith in us
a1. Demonstrating how, if it is right for us to feel anger towards those who have
slandered us and caused others to lose their faith in us, then it would be
proper if we were to feel anger as well towards anyone who ever slandered
anyone else
b1. Demonstrating how, if we can tolerate people's lack of faith in someone else,
we should also tolerate their lack of faith in ourselves, since it comes about
through mental affliction

maintaining patience over our current hardships, we will be able to
achieve the goals of every living being

a) Giving up any feeling of being unable to tolerate those who sing the praises of our
enemies, and who declare their fame
i) Why it is appropriate to hope for this to happen, since it can cause us to be happy
ourselves
ii) Why it is inappropriate not to hope for this to happen, since it causes the other
person [the one being praised] to be happy
a1. The fact that, if we wish against the happiness of others, it causes our own
happiness to decline
b1. Why it is, therefore, right to hope for the happiness of others
b) Giving up any feeling of being unable to tolerate those who bring happiness to our
enemies
c) Giving up any feeling of being unable to tolerate those who help our enemies to obtain
things

i) Considering how our own wishes have been fulfilled
a1. Why it is appropriate to feel glad that living beings have obtained the
possessions they wanted
b1. A metaphor
c1. Why, if we hope against these things, our wish for enlightenment will decline
ii) Considering how there is nothing not to want
a1. Why it is inappropriate to feel jealousy when others obtain possessions
b1. How wrong it is to discard our own good qualities
c1. Why it is appropriate to feel grief over our own bad deeds, rather than feeling
jealousy over the good deeds of others
***********
c. Stopping anger over the things that block us from what we want
i. Why it is wrong to feel that we cannot tolerate things that block the harms that we
wish upon our enemies
a) Why disliking our enemies does no help to us
b) Why hoping to harm out enemies does no harm to our enemies
c) Why it does hurt ourselves
i) Why it is wrong to be glad when harm comes to our enemies
ii) Why, if we maintain such a feeling of gladness, it turns into a cause
that will produce massive suffering for none other than ourselves
ii. Why it is wrong to feel that we cannot tolerate things that block the benefits that
we wish upon ourselves and those on our side
a) Why it is wrong to feel anger over someone blocking us from getting a worldly
object
i) Considering how wrong it is to feel anger towards someone who has
blocked you from praise and fame
a1. The fact that there is no use to praise and fame per se
b1. Why mental pleasure itself is no appropriate object to strive for
c1. How it is a mistaken idea to think that this in itself is an object to
strive for
a2. How there is no use to praise and fame perse

b2. How being upset about losing them is equivalent to the behavior
of a child
d1. The reason why it is a mistake to think so
a2. Why it is wrong to feel attached to the good feeling we have
towards those who praise us
b2. Why it is appropriate to bring good feelings to all living beings,
if bringing a good feeling to someone else this way is something
to strive for
a3. The point itself
b3. Why it is nothing more than the behavior of a child to feel
pleased when others praise us
ii) Considering how they have actually helped you by doing so
a1. Why it is inappropriate to feel anger towards someone who has
blocked you from praise and fame, since they have thereby blocked
you from going to the lower realms
a2. How every bad quality grows from craving for praise and fame
b2. How blocking them acts to block a birth in the lower realms
b1. Why it is inappropriate to feel anger towards this same person, since
they are thereby leading you out of the cycle of suffering existence
a2. Why, because the things that block you from praise and the rest
also act to free you from the cycle of suffering, it is inappropriate
to feel anger
b2. Why, because they act to shut the door to suffering, it is
inappropriate to feel anger
b) Why it is wrong to feel anger over someone blocking us from accomplishing
merit
i) Why it is wrong to feel anger over someone having blocked us from
accomplishing merit

a3. How rare exceptional objects of virtue are
b3. Why it is right to be glad about them
c3. Why it is right to feel the desire to be of benefit to these
persons
b2. How their being so does not depend upon any intended benefit
a3. Why it is incorrect to think that, because they did not intend
us any benefit, they are not worthy of our offerings
b3. Why it is incorrect to think that, because they did intend us
harm, they are not worthy of our offerings
c3. Why therefore, as they have provided us with an object
towards which to focus our patience, they are worthy of our
offerings
c2. How to look upon them as if they were the Teacher
a3. An expanded explanation
a4. How scripture itself states that living beings and Buddhas
are equivalent as objects towards which to perform merit
b4. Establishing this point with logic as well
a5. How, by having faith in both the Buddhas and all
living beings, we can reach our ultimate dreams
b5. Why it is wrong to discriminate between them, since
they are equivalent from the point of view that, by
having faith in both, we can reach enlightenment
c4. Refuting any rebuttal
a5. Refuting the idea that, since their good qualities are
not equal, it is incorrect to practice equivalent faith in
them
b5. Why it is correct to practice equivalent faith in the
two, since great faith in each is an equivalent cause
for reaching enlightenment
c5. Why it is right to feel faith, since the merit from

making offerings to a living being who has even a
fraction of the good qualities of a Buddha is limitless
b3. A summary

Course XI: Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life, Part II
Reading Four: Contemplations on the Perfection of Effort, Part I
The following contemplations are based on the Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way
of Life (Bodhisattvacharyavatara; Byang-chub-sems-dpa'i spyod-pa la 'jug-pa) of the
Buddhist master Shantideva (circa 700 AD), and the commentary upon it by
Gyaltsab Je Darma Rinchen (1364-1432) entitled Entry Point for Children of the
Victorious Buddhas (rGyal-sras 'jug-ngogs). The relevant sections are found at
folios 20A-20B and 77A-79A, respectively, in the ACIP electronic editions
TD3871 and S5436.
The content of the contemplations is translated directly from the root text and
commentary; the names of the contemplations are not a part of the original
text, but are based on the divisions of Gyaltsab Je's commentary and have been
supplied for reference. Each lesson is accompanied by the full detailed outline
for the section from Gyaltsab Je's commentary.
************
Contemplation One
What moves the flame?

,DE LTAR BZOD PAS BRTZON 'GRUS BRTZAM,
,'DI LTAR BRTZON LA BYANG CHUB GNAS,
,RLUNG MED G-YO BA MED PA BZHIN,
,BSOD NAMS BRTZON 'GRUS MED MI 'BYUNG ,
Once you have practiced patience, begin
Your practice of effort, for enlightenment lies
In making these kinds of effort.
Without a breeze they never flicker,
And just so in the absence of effort
Merit can never occur.

SNGAR BSHAD PA DE LTAR BKA' SPYOD DANG GZHAN GYI GNOD PA LA BZOD PAS BYANG CHUB MYUR DU THOB PAR 'DOD NA BRTZON 'GRUS BRTZAM PAR BYA DGOS TE, 'DI LTAR SPYOD PA PHAR PHYIN LA BRTZON PA LA BYANG CHUB GNAS TE MAR ME LA SOGS PA RLUNG MED NA G-YO BA MED PA BZHIN DU BSOD NAMS DANG YE SHES KYI TSOGS KYANG BRTZON 'GRUS MED NA 'BYUNG BAR MI 'GYUR BAS BLA NA MED PA'I BYANG CHUB NI BRTZON 'GRUS LA RAG LAS PAS 'BAD PAR BYA'O, , DBU MA LA 'JUG PA LAS, YON TAN MA LUS BRTZON 'GRUS RJES 'GRO ZHING , BSOD NAMS BLO GROS TSOGS NI GNYIS KYI RGYU, , ZHES BSHAD PA LTAR RO,
Once you have practiced patience as described above--that is, once you have
learned to maintain your patience with various spiritual hardships, and with
the harms that others do to you--then you must, if you hope to achieve
enlightenment quickly, begin your practice of effort. This is because enlightenment
lies in making these kinds of effort in the different perfections. Butter lamps and
other such flames never flicker without a breeze, and just so--in the absence of
effort--it can never occur that one manages to complete the collections of merit
and wisdom. As such, the matchless state of enlightenment itself is something
that all depends upon effort, and so we must make great efforts in practicing
it. Entering the Middle Way makes this same point when it states,
All good qualities are things that follow
In the wake of the perfection of effort.
It is the one cause that brings about both
The collections of merit and knowledge.

Contemplation Two
Effort is joy

,BRTZON GANG DGE LA SPRO BA'O,
What is effort? It is joy
In doing good.

NYON MONGS LA SPRO BA LE LO YIN PAS BRTZON 'GRUS GANG ZHE NA DGE BA'I DMIGS PA LA SPRO BA'O, , DE LA DBYE NA GO CHA'I BRTZON 'GRUS DANG , SBYOR BA'I BRTZON 'GRUS DANG , MA ZHUM ZHING MI 'KHRUGS PA'I BRTZON 'GRUS DANG , CHOG MI SHES PA'I BRTZON 'GRUS TE BZHI'O,
"If laziness is defined as joy in mental affliction, then what is effort?" one may
ask. Effort is a feeling of joy focused upon doing something good.
Effort can be divided into four different types: effort which is like armor;
applied effort; effort where you never feel discouraged or upset; and effort
where you are never satisfied.

Contemplation Three
What stops effort?

,DE YI MI MTHUN PHYOGS BSHAD BYA,
,LE LO NGAN LA ZHEN PA DANG ,
,SGYID LUG BDAG NYID BRNYAS PA'O,
Here I will explain the things
That work against it: these are
Laziness, an attraction to what is bad,
And the feeling of being discouraged--
Belittling yourself.

BRTZON 'GRUS DE'I MI MTHUN PHYOGS BSHAD PAR BYA'O, , GANG ZHE NA, LUS DANG YID LAS SU MI RUNG BA SNYOM LAS KYI BDE BA LA ZHEN PA'I LE LO DANG , BYA BA NGAN PA LA ZHEN PA DANG , DGE BA BSGRUB PA LA SGYID LUG NAS NGAS MI NUS SNYAM DU BDAG NYID LA BRNYAS PA'O,
Here next I will explain the things that work against "it"--meaning effort. What
exactly are they? First there is laziness, which is feeling attracted to the pleasant
feeling of sloth, a condition where the mind and body become unfit to function
well. Next there is an attraction to actions which are bad, and then finally the
feeling of being discouraged when you try to accomplish some virtuous
act--where you belittle yourself by saying, "This is something I could never
accomplish."

,GNYIS PA LA GSUM, SNYOM LAS LA RO MYANG BA'I LE LO SPANG BA DANG , BYA BA NGAN PA LA ZHEN PA'I LE LO SPANG BA DANG , DGE BA LA SGYID LUG PA'I LE LO SPANG BA'O,
The second point, how to eliminate the things that work against effort, has
three parts: eliminating the kind of laziness where you enjoy the pleasant
feeling of sloth; eliminating the kind of laziness where you are attracted to bad
activities; and eliminating the kind of laziness where you feel discouraged in
the practice of virtue.

Contemplation Four
What causes laziness?

,SNYOM LAS BDE BA'I RO MYANG DANG ,
,GNYID LA BRTEN PA'I SRED PA YIS,
,'KHOR BA'I SDUG BSNGAL MI SKYO LAS,
,LE LO NYE BAR SKYE BAR 'GYUR,
What promotes the feeling of laziness
Is sloth--the sweet enjoyment of
Some pleasure--as well as a craving
For time spent sleeping, all leading to
A failure to feel a sense of disgust
For the pain of the circle of life.

DANG PO LA GNYIS, LE LO'I RGYU BRTAGS NAS SPANG BA DANG , JI LTAR SPONG BA'I TSUL LO, , DANG PO NI, LE LO SKYE BA'I RGYU GANG ZHE NA, DGE BA LA MI 'JUG PA'I SNYOM LAS LA BDE BAR BZUNG NAS DE LA ZHEN PA'I BDE BA'I RO MYANG BA DANG , GNYID LA BRTEN PA'I SRED PA YIS KYANG LE LO SKYED PAR BYED LA 'KHOR BA LA CUNG ZAD KYANG MI SKRAG PAR 'KHOR BA'I SDUG BSNGAL LA MI SKYO BA LAS, LE LO NYE BAR SKYE BAR 'GYUR BAS RGYU NGOS BZUNG NAS LE LO 'GOG PA LA BRTZON PAR BYA'O,
The first point, eliminating the kind of laziness where you enjoy the pleasant
feeling of sloth, has two parts of its own: examining the causes of laziness, so
as to eliminate it, and then how to actually eliminate it. Here is the first.
"What is it," one may ask, "that causes laziness?" Laziness is produced first of
all by the sweet enjoyment of some pleasure, which is a tendency to crave the
feeling of sloth. Sloth itself is a reluctance to engage in virtuous activities, and
the craving for it comes as one learns to think of it as something pleasant.
Laziness is as well produced by a craving for time spent sleeping. All this leads to
a failure to feel a sense of disgust for the pain of the circle of life--you fail to feel
any fear at all for the circle. These are what promote the feeling of laziness; one
must recognize these causes for what they are, and put forth great effort then
to stop laziness altogether.

Contemplation Five
Lambs to the slaughter

,RANG SDE RIM GYIS GSOD PA YANG ,
,KHYOD KYIS MTHONG BAR MA GYUR TAM,
,'ON KYANG GNYID LA BRTEN PA GANG ,
,GDOL PA DANG NI MA HE BZHIN,
Haven't you even got eyes to see
How those in the world with you
Have gone steadily to the slaughter?
To sit here still and enjoy your sleep
Is just the same as the oxen
Waiting for the butcher.

RGAN GZHON BAR MA LA SOGS PA'I RANG SDE 'CHI BDAG GIS RIMS KYIS GSOD PA YANG , KHYOD KYIS MNGON SUM DU MTHONG BAR MA GYUR TAM DE LTAR MTHONG YANG 'ON KYANG GNYID LA BRTEN PA'I SRED PA GANG YIN PA DE NI MI RIGS TE, DPER NA GDOL PAS RIMS GYIS GSOD PA'I MA HE GZHAN GSOD PA MTHONG YANG , SKRAG PA MED CING DAL BAR GNAS PA GDOL PA DANG NI MA HE BZHIN NO,
Those in the world with you--whether old, young, inbetween, or anything
else--have gone steadily to the slaughter, killed by the Lord of Death. Haven't you
even got eyes to see what's going on? If you do see it, then just sitting here still
and enjoying your sleep is something very wrong. You are for example just the
same as the oxen waiting for the butcher; that is, you are like an ox who can see
that the other oxen are being steadily slaughtered by a butcher, and yet still
feels no fear, and simply relaxes where he is.

Contemplation Six
"I still have time"

,MYUR BA NYID DU 'CHI 'GYUR BAS,
,JI SRID DU NI TSOGS BSAG BYA,
,DE TSE LE LO SPANGS KYANG NI,
,DUS MA YIN PAR CI ZHIG BYA,
Death is coming to take you, moving
At incredible speed; in the time
You have left, try to amass good karma.
When the moment arrives it's true you may
Give up your laziness, but what good
Can it do at a time so wrong?

,'DI NI MA BYAS BRTZAMS PA DANG ,
,'DI PHYED BYAS PAR GNAS PA LA,
,GLO BUR 'CHI BDAG 'ONGS NAS NI,
,KYI HUD BCOM ZHES SEMS PAR 'GYUR,
You haven't got to this just yet,
The other's just started, and yet another
Has half still left to do.
Suddenly then does the Lord of Death
Make his arrival, and in your mind
You can only cry, "He kills me!"

GNYIS PA NI, DA DUNG CUNG ZAD LONG YOD CE NA, MYUR BA NYID DU 'CHI BAR 'GYUR BAS JI SRID DU 'CHI BDAG GIS MA ZIN PA DE SRID DU NI TSOGS BSAG PAR BYA'O,
Here is the second point, which is why, since we are going to die quickly, we
should exert ourselves in practicing virtue. You may say, "Oh, but I still have
a little time left." Death is coming to take you, moving at incredible speed; in the
time that you do have left before the Lord of Death captures you, you must try
to amass good karma.

,GSUM PA NI, 'CHI BAS ZIN PA DE'I TSE LE LO SPANGS KYANG NI DUS MA YIN PAR 'BAD PAS CI ZHIG BYA, DGOS PA CUNG ZAD KYANG MI 'GRUB PA'I PHYIR RO,
Here is the third point, which is why the moment of death is the wrong time
to give up your laziness. When the moment arrives that Death grasps on to
you, it's true you may give up your laziness, but what good can it do to try to make
your efforts at a time so wrong? There would be absolutely no purpose served
by doing so.

,BZHI PA NI, MYUR DU 'CHI BAS LAS 'DI NI MA BYAS PA DANG CUNG ZAD BRTZAMS PA DANG , BYA BA 'DI PHYED TZAM BYAS PAR GNAS PA LA GLO BUR DU 'CHI BDAG 'ONGS NAS NI 'GYOD BZHIN DU KYI HUD BDAG BCOM ZHES SEMS SHING BSTABS PAS 'GYOD PAR 'GYUR NA, DE'I TSE CI ZHIG BYA DA LTA NYID NAS DGE BA LA BRTZON PAR BYA'O,
Here is the fourth point, which is why it is wrong to be lazy, given the fact
that death will come suddenly, before you have a chance to do everything you
wanted to do. And so you are going to die suddenly; suddenly then does the
Lord of Death make his arrival, and there are things that you'd planned that you
haven't got to just yet, and others that are just barely started, and yet others that
have about half still left to do. With intense feelings of regret then you can only
cry OK in your mind, stricken with the thought, "He kills me!" What can you
possibly do when this moment comes? Better to devote all your efforts right
now to the practice of good deeds.

Contemplation Seven
What it feels to die

,RANG SDIG DRAN PAS GDUNG PA DANG ,
,DMYAL BA'I SGRA NI THOS PA YIS,
,SKRAG PAS MI GTZANG LUS GOS SHING ,
,MYOS PAR 'GYUR TSE CI ZHIG BYA,
What is it that you imagined you'd do
At that moment, tormented by the memory
Of the wrongs you've done, and with the roar
Of the hell realms in your ears bringing
Such terror that you cover your body in shit,
And reach the depths of insanity?

SNGAR RANG GIS SDIG PA BYAS PA DRAN PAS SEMS GDUNGS PA DANG , DMYAL BAR SDUG BSNGAL CHEN PO MYONG DGOS PA BSREG PA LA SOGS PA'I DMYAL BA'I SGRA NI THOS PA YIS BDAG KYANG DER 'GRO'O SNYAM DU SKRAG PAS BRED NAS, MI GTZANG BAS LUS GOS SHING SEMS MYOS PAR GYUR PA DE'I TSE SKABS MA YIN PA LA BRTZON PAS CI ZHIG BYA DA LTA NYID NAS DGE BA LA BRTZON PAR BYA'O,
The time will come, on your deathbed, that your mind is tormented by the
memory of all the wrong things that you have ever done. You will realize that
these are going to force you to experience extraordinary suffering in the hells,
and the roar of the fires and such in the hell realms will fill your ears. When you
hear the roar, the thought "Now I must go there too!" will come, and strike you
full of terror. This then will cause you to cover your body in shit, and to reach to
the depths of insanity. So just what is it that you imagined you'd do, what efforts
did you think you were going to make, at that moment, so much a very wrong
time for anything? Again, you must make efforts to practice good deeds,
beginning immediately.

Contemplation Eight
Examine your expectations

,BRTZON MED 'BRAS BU 'DOD PA DANG ,
,BZE RE CAN LA GNOD MANG ZHING ,
,'CHI BAS BZUNG BZHIN LHA 'DRA BA,
,KYI HUD SDUG BSNGAL DAG GIS BCOM,
You set your hopes on results, unwilling
To make any effort; sufferings shower
Down on those least able to bear them.
Already in the embrace of death, you imagine
Yourself an immortal, cry out
When sufferings come to destroy you.

,MI YI GRU LA BRTEN NAS SU,
,SDUG BSNGAL CHU BO CHE LAS SGROL,
,GRU 'DI PHYI NAS RNYED DKA' BAS,
,RMONGS PA DUS SU GNYID MA 
You must make use of this boat,
The human life you have, to cross over
The great river of suffering.
The boat is hard to find again later;
Do not sit then, ignorant one,
At this moment there asleep.

LOG,DGA' BA'I RGYU NI MTHA' YAS PA'I,
,DAM CHOS DGA' BA'I MCHOG SPANGS NAS,
,SDUG BSNGAL RGYU YIS GA YENG BA DANG ,
,RGOD SOGS LA KHYOD CI PHYIR DGA',
You give up the highest kind of pleasure,
The holy Dharma, infinite numbers
Of causes that bring you pleasure.
Why is it you are attracted so much
To being distracted by causes for pain,
To busyness and the like?

BDE BA'I RGYU DGE BA LA BRTZON PA MED PAR 'BRAS BU BDE BA 'DOD PA DANG , SDUG BSNGAL CUNG ZAD TZAM LA'ANG SRAN CHUNG BA'I BZE RE CAN LA SDUG BSNGAL GYI GNOD PA MANG ZHING , 'CHI BAS GZUNG BZHIN DU LHA 'DRA BAR YUN RING DU GSON DU RE BA RNAMS LA 'DOD PA MI THOB CING MI 'DOD PA THOB PAS KYI HUD SDUG BSNGAL DAG GIS BCOM PAR 'GYUR RO,
Here is the third part, which is how contradictory it is to hope for happiness
on the one hand, and on the other hand not to make any efforts in the practice
of good deeds. Suppose you are the kind of person who is setting their hopes
on results, meaning happiness itself, but who is unwilling to make any effort in
what causes this happiness: that is, in the practice of doing good deeds. You
are also one of those who is least able to bear sufferings, you cannot tolerate them
at all, and yet all kinds of pain shower down upon you. And already in the
embrace of death, you imagine yourself to be some kind of immortal. In this case
then the things you hope for you will never find, and everything you hope to
avoid will happen. When these sufferings come to destroy you then, you will cry
out loud.

,BZHI PA NI, 'O NA JI LTAR BYA ZHE NA, DAL 'BYOR THOB PA'I RTEN LA 'BAD NA SDUG BSNGAL MTHA' DAG LAS SGROL NUS PAS MI'I LUS KYI GRU LA BRTEN NAS NI 'KHOR BA'I SDUG BSNGAL GYI CHU BO CHE LAS SGROL CIG CES PA DAL 'BYOR DON CHE BA'O, , DAL 'BYOR GYI BSGRUB PA SHIN TU DKON PAS NA GRU 'DI PHYIS NAS RNYED DKA' BAS RMONGS PA ZHES BOS NAS, GRU RNYED PA'I DUS SU GNYID MA LOG PAR SKYES BU CHUNG 'BRING CHEN PO GSUM GYI LAM NYAMS SU BLANGS PA'I SGO NAS 'KHOR BA'I CHU BO LAS SGROL BAR BYA'O, , DAL 'BYOR RNYED DKA' BA RNYED PA'I DUS SU 'DOD DGOS PAR BSTAN TO,
Here is the forth point, which is an urgent request from Master Shantideva that
we make efforts in the various methods to escape from pain. "Well then," one
may ask, "what should I be doing about it?" The text here is describing how
important it is that you have found a life complete with all the various
spiritual leisures and fortunes; it is saying you have found now a human form
that has all the spiritual leisures and fortunes. If you make efforts to use it
well--that is, if you make use of this boat, the human life and body you now
have--then it can allow you to cross over each and every kind of pain there is.
So please, you must make the crossing now, over the great river of the sufferings
of the circle of life.

,GNYIS PA BYA BA NGAN PA LA ZHEN PA'I LE LO SPANG BA NI 'DI PHYI THAMS CAD DGA' BA'I RGYU NI MTHA' YAS PA'I THABS DAM PA'I CHOS NYAMS SU LEN PA LA DGA' BA'I MCHOG SPANGS NAS, 'BRAS BU SDUG BSNGAL GYI RGYU SDIG PA DANG 'DU 'DZI MANG PO'I GA YENG BA DANG RGOD PA SOGS BYA BA MA YIN PA MANG PO LA KHYOD CI'I PHYIR DGA', DGA' BAR MI RIGS TE SDUG BSNGAL GYI RGYU YIN PA'I PHYIR RO,
To achieve a life of these leisures and fortunes is something very rare, and thus
this boat is something hard to find again later. And so Master Shantideva calls
to us, "Oh ignorant ones, do not sit there, at this present moment when you have
found this boat, quietly asleep. You must cross over now the great river of the
circle of suffering, by putting into practice the three paths designed for people
of lesser, medium, and greater scope." This is a teaching then on the need to
make efforts when you have finally found the spiritual leisures and fortunes
which are so very hard to find.
Here is the second overall point, which is eliminating the kind of laziness
where you are attracted to bad activities. The highest kind of pleasure is that
which comes from putting into actual practice the holy Dharma, which is a
specific method for planting infinite numbers of causes that bring you pleasure in
this and your future lives. And yet in your actions you give up this highest
pleasure, and then you throw yourself into negative behavior: into bad deeds
that will only act as causes that bring you the result of pain; into the distraction
that comes from exposing yourself to great hustle and bustle; and into busyness
of the mind, and the like. Why is it that you are attracted so much to these things?
It is something very wrong, for they can only bring you suffering.

Course XI: Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life, Part II
Reading Five: Contemplations on the Perfection of Effort, Part II
The following contemplations are based on the Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way
of Life (Bodhisattvacharyavatara; Byang-chub-sems-dpa'i spyod-pa la 'jug-pa) of the
Buddhist master Shantideva (circa 700 AD), and the commentary upon it by
Gyaltsab Je Darma Rinchen (1364-1432) entitled Entry Point for Children of the
Victorious Buddhas (rGyal-sras 'jug-ngogs). The relevant sections are found at
folios 20B-21A and 79B-81A, respectively, in the ACIP electronic editions
TD3871 and S5436.
The content of the contemplations is translated directly from the root text and
commentary; the names of the contemplations are not a part of the original
text, but are based on the divisions of Gyaltsab Je's commentary and have been
supplied for reference. Each lesson is accompanied by the full detailed outline
for the section from Gyaltsab Je's commentary.

Never feel discouraged, assemble the forces,

Yourself and others as well.

Here is the first point, which is advice to make efforts in applying the antidotes
for feeling discouraged. A king defeats his enemies by making use of the four
traditional armed forces, and warrior bodhisattva do the same. They open
their practice by inspiring themselves--for this they utilize "armor effort,"
which enables them never to have thoughts where they feel discouraged in their
practice of the path.

Then they make use of "working effort," where they work or apply themselves
to the task of assembling the two great armed forces, the two collections. Then
when the actual fight begins, they use engaged effort, where as they actually
undertake their virtues they engage themselves gladly with constant recollection
and awareness. Lastly they bring to bear their self-command, a state of complete
control where you find yourself able to make your body and mind do anything
that you ask them to do.
When you have done all this then you must as well undertake the practices of
seeing yourself and other people as equal, and finally exchanging yourself and others,
in the manner that we will describe these two below [in the chapter on
meditation].

Contemplation Ten
On feeling discouraged

,BDAG GIS BYANG CHUB GA LA ZHES,
,SGYID LUG PAR NI MI BYA STE,
,'DI LTAR DE BZHIN GSHEGS PA NI,
,BDEN PA GSUNG BAS BDEN 'DI GSUNGS,
Never allow yourself the feeling
Of being discouraged, of having the thought
"How could I ever become enlightened?"
About this Those Who have Gone Thus,
The Ones who speak the truth, have spoken
The following words of truth:

,SBRANG BU SHA SBRANG BUNG BA DANG ,
,DE BZHIN SRIN BUR GANG GYUR PA,
,DES KYANG BRTZON PA'I STOBS BSKYED NA,
,BYANG CHUB THOB DKA' BLA MED 'THOB,
Those beings who are flies and gnats,
Or bees, and even those
Who live as worms as well
Can reach unmatched enlightenment,
So difficult to reach,
If they develop the force of effort.

,BDAG LTA RIGS KYIS MIR SKYES LA,
,PHAN DANG GNOD PA'I NGO SHES PAS,
,BYANG CHUB SPYOD PA MA BTANG NA,
,BDAG GIS BYANG CHUB CIS MI 'THOB,
Someone like me, someone born
As a member of human kind,
Can tell what helps or hurts.
Assuming then that I never give up
The bodhisattva's way of life,
Why shouldn't I reach enlightenment?

GNYIS PA NI, SANGS RGYAS NYID NI DBANG PO RNON PO BRTZON 'GRUS BRTZAMS PA BSOD NAMS KYI TSOGS MTHA' YAS PA BSAGS PA SHIN TU BYA DKA' BA'I SPYOD PA BSKAL PA GRANGS MED DU MAR NYAMS SU LEN PAS SGRUB PAR BYA BA YIN NA, BDAG NI DE LTA BU MA YIN PAS BDAG GIS BYANG CHUB GA LA THOB CES ZHUM NAS SGYID LUG PAR NI MI BYA STE, 'DI LTAR DE BZHIN GSHEGS PA NI BDEN PA 'BA' ZHIG GSUNG PAS BDEN PA 'DI GSUNG TE, PHYIN CI LOG GSUNG PA'I RGYU MED PAS YID BRTON DU RUNG BA'I PHYIR RO,
Here is the second point, which presents an explanation from scripture on how
to put these antidotes into practice. Now you might have the following thought:
The state of Buddhahood is something that people of very great
powers of intellect achieve only after applying incredible
effort--over a period of many "countless" eons--in the pursuit of
extremely difficult practices, and thereby amassing a virtually
limitless amount of meritorious karma. I am nothing like these
people; so how could I ever become enlightened?
Never though allow yourself the feeling of being discouraged in this way, of
despairing that you could ever accomplish these things. About this Those Who
have Gone Thus, the Ones who can only speak the truth, have spoken the following
words, which are truth and which are something we can believe in, since They
have absolutely no reason ever to say something which is wrong.

,JI LTAR GSUNGS ZHE NA LAG BZANG GIS ZHUS PA LAS, GZHAN YANG BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA' 'DI LTAR YANG DAG PAR RJES SU SLOB STE GANG DAG SENG GE DANG , STAG DANG , KHYI DANG , CE SPYANG DANG , BYA RGOD DANG KHRUNG KHRUNG DANG BYA ROG DANG 'UG PA DANG SRIN BU DANG , SBRANG MA DANG SBRANG BU DANG SHA SBRANG DU GYUR PA DE DAG KYANG BLA NA MED PAR BYANG CHUB TU 'TSANG RGYA BAR 'GYUR NA

And what are the words which they spoke? They come from the Sutra
Requested by Subahu--
Bodhisattvas must, moreover, master the following way of
thinking: "Even those beings who are lions, or tigers, or dogs, or
wolves, or vultures, or cranes, or crows, or owls, or worms, or
flies, or bees, or gnats can bring about the matchless state of
enlightenment. And here am I, someone who is living the life of
a human--now, no matter what, even if it costs me my life, I will
put forth whatever effort is needed to reach enlightenment.
This same point is made in the sutra known as The Cloud of the Jewels as well.
 , GSUM PA LA BZHI, BRTZON PA'I STOBS BSKYED NA BYANG CHUB THOB NUS PAR BSAM PA DANG , BYANG CHUB SGRUB PA'I DKA' SPYAD LA NGAN 'GRO'I SDUG BSNGAL GYI CHA TZAM YANG MED PAS BZOD RIGS PA DANG , SMAN PA'I RGYAL POS CHO GA 'JAM POS NAD CHEN PO GSO BAR MDZAD PAS BZOD RIGS PA DANG , DE LA SDUG BSNGAL MED CING BDE BA RGYAS PAS DGA' BAR RIGS PA'O, , DANG PO NI,
The third section, describes how, if we make effort, we will be able to stop our
laziness, and then achieve enlightenment. Here there are four parts:
contemplating the fact that, if we are able to raise the force of effort, we will
find ourselves able to achieve enlightenment; why it is right to bear gladly
those hardships required to reach enlightenment, given the fact that they
involve not even the tiniest fraction of the pain of the lower realms; why it is
right to bear gladly with any pain required, given the fact that the King of
Physicians cures the great illness with a technique which is very gentle; and
why it is right for us to feel glad over the treatment of our great illness, since
it involves no pain at all, but rather causes our happiness to flourish. Here is
the first.

SNGAR BSHAD PA LTAR SBRANG BU SHA SBRANG BUNG BA DANG , DE BZHIN SRIN BUR YANG GYUR PA DES KYANG BRTZON PA'I STOBS BSKYED DE, TSOGS BSAGS NA BYANG CHUB THOB DKA' BA BLA MED THOB PAR

As we just noted, it has been spoken that even those beings who are flies and
gnats, or bees, and even those who live as worms as well can reach unmatched
enlightenment, which is so difficult to reach, if they "develop the force of effort";
which is to say, if they amass the necessary good karma. We can thus think
to ourselves,
And then there is someone like me, someone born as a member of a
kind of being which is truly extraordinary: I have been born
human. And I possess as well an extraordinary mental ability;
that is, I can tell what will help or what will hurt me in my pursuit
of the state of enlightenment. Assuming then that I never give up
the bodhisattva's way of life--which is to say, assuming that I can
continue to practice the activities which bodhisattvas do
continually--why shouldn't I reach enlightenment? Of course I can.

Contemplation Eleven

,'ON TE RKANG LAG LA SOGS PA,

,RMONGS PAS BDAG NI 'JIGS PAR ZAD,
Now suppose you say, "But I feel a fear
For the act of having to give away
My arms and legs and such,"
But it's nothing more than ignorance,
A failure to judge what's really heavy
Or light that makes you afraid.

,BSKAL PA BYE BA GRANGS MED DU,

Over countless millions of eons
Infinite times your body's been sliced,
Or stabbed or scorched with fire,
Or chopped up into pieces;
Yet still you were not able then
To reach to enlightenment.

Here is the second point, which is why it is right to bear gladly those
hardships required to reach enlightenment, given the fact that they involve not
even the tiniest fraction of the pain of the lower realms. Within this point
there are three topics: why it is wrong to fear spiritual hardships such as
giving away one's arms and legs or the like; how one will not have to
experience even a fraction of the sufferings found in the lower realms; and a
metaphor to illustrate why it is right that we should bear with minor pains in
order to destroy the great illness. Here is the first.

'ON TE BRTZON PAS SGRUB NUS KYANG RKANG LAG DANG MGO LA SOGS PA SBYIN PAR BTANG DGOS PAS BYA DKA' BA'I SPYOD PA DE DAG BDAG GIS MI NUS PAS BDAG NI 'JIGS ZHE NA, DE DAG SBYIN PAR GTANG DGOS KYANG SDUG BSNGAL LCI BA DANG YANG BA'I KHYAD PAR LEGS PAR MA DPYAD PAR 'DOR LEN LA RMONGS PAS BDAG NI 'JIGS PA ZAD KYI 
Now suppose you say the following: "It may be true that I can reach
enlightenment if I exert a certain amount of effort, but it is said that at some
point I will have to do things like giving away my arms and legs, and head and
such. I don't think I would ever be able to undertake these very difficult acts,
and so I feel a fear for them." It may actually be necessary at some point to give
away these things, but it is nothing more than your ignorance of what is
appropriate that makes you feel afraid: you have simply failed to judge carefully
what kinds of pain are heavy, and which are light.

'JIGS MI DGOS TE, THOG MA MED PA NAS 'KHOR BAR 'KHOR BA'I TSE DMYAL BAR BSKAL PA BYE BA GRANGS MED DU LAN CIG MA YIN PAR LAN GRANGS DU MAR LUS BCAD PA DANG , DBUG PA DANG , MES BSREG PA DANG , MTSON GYIS GSHEGS PA'I SDUG BSNGAL MYONG BAR 'GYUR GYI DE TZAM MYONG YANG LUS DON MED LA CHUD ZOS PA MA GTOGS, BLA NA MED PA'I BYANG CHUB THOB PAR MI 'GYUR RO,
In truth there is no need to feel afraid. You have been wandering around the
circle of suffering life for time with no beginning, and over this time you have
spent countless millions of eons in the hells. Infinite times, not just once or twice,
you have experienced there the suffering of having your body sliced, or stabbed,
or scorched with fire, or chopped up into pieces with various bladed weapons. Yet
still you were only wasting bodies meaninglessly; you were not able then to use
this experience to help you reach to enlightenment.

Contemplation Twelve
The lesser pains of the Physician's treatment

,BDAG GIS BYANG CHUB SGRUB PA YI,
,SDUG BSNGAL 'DI NI TSOD YOD DE,
,ZUG RNGU KHONG BRLAG GNOD BSAL PHYIR,
,LUS RMA BTOD PA'I SDUG BSNGAL BZHIN,
The sufferings now that I must bear
To reach enlightenment
Are something that has a limit.
They are like the pain that one endures
When a cut is made to stop
Some agony spreading inside the chest.

,SMAN PA KUN KYANG GSO DPYAD KYI,

Every doctor as well makes use
Of treatments that cause discomfort
To cure some greater illness.
I should then learn to bear some minor
Hurt for the sake of bringing destruction
Upon a multitude of pains.

GNYIS PA NI, NGAN 'GRO'I SDUG BSNGAL LA BSAMS NA BDAG GIS BYANG CHUB SGRUB PA'I DKA' SPYAD KYI SDUG BSNGAL 'DI NI, SNGA MA LA LTOS NA DUS THUNG ZHING SHIN TU CHUNG BA'I TSOD YOD CING BZOD SLA BA ZHIG STE, NAD KYI ZUG RNGU KHONG PAR RLAG PA'I GNOD PA BSAL PA'I PHYIR TU LUS LA RMA CUNG ZAD GTOD PA'I SDUG BSNGAL BZOD NUS PA BZHIN NO,
Here is the second part, [continued from the previous contemplation].
Consider the difference between the sufferings of the three lower realms and
the sufferings that I must now bear to reach enlightenment. Compared to the
former, the latter are something that has a limit; that is, they are relatively very
brief and insignificant, and quite easy to bear. They are like the pain that one is
able to endure when a small cut is made on the body, in order to stop the agony
of some dangerous illness which is beginning to spread inside the chest.

,GSUM PA NI, DE LTAR SMAN PA KUN KYANG MI BDE BA CUNG ZAD TZAM PA YIS NAD MED PAR BYED PA BZHIN DU, BYANG CHUB SGRUB PA'I DKA' SPYAD KYANG SDUG BSNGAL SHIN TU CHUNG BA DE BAS NA 'KHOR BA'I SDUG BSNGAL MANG PO DAG GZHOM PA'I PHYIR TU DKA' SPYOD KYI MI BDE BA CHUNG NGU DE YANG BZOD PAR BYA STE, RANG GZHAN GYI DUS DPAG TU MED PA'I SDUG BSNGAL ZHI BAR BYED PA'I PHYIR RO,
Here is the third part. Every doctor there is makes use as well of treatments that
cause some minor bit of discomfort, in order to cure some greater illness. The
pains which I may experience with the hardships that I undertake for the sake
of achieving enlightenment are very minor. I should then--meaning
therefore--learn to bear with the minor hurt involved in these hardships,
performed as they are for the sake of bringing destruction upon the multitude of
pains found here in the circle of suffering life. The whole reason for me to
endure these pains is that I am going to extinguish the sufferings that I myself,
and others as well, must endure over a limitless period of time.

Contemplation Thirteen
A blissful path to bliss

,GSO DPYAD PHAL PA 'DI 'DRA BA,

His treatments in a way that's like

To acts of charity such as giving

,GANG TSE RANG GI LUS LA NI,

There comes a point when we reach a state
Of mind where we can view
Our bodies just like the vegetables.
At that stage then why is it we
Would feel it difficult at all
To offer our flesh or the rest?

The third part concerns why it is right to bear gladly with any pain required,
given the fact that the King of Physicians cures the great illness with a
technique which is very gentle. Here there are three different topics: how the
Teacher shows us a method to cure the great illness which does not require us
to experience the slightest bit of pain during the treatment; how the Teacher
has prohibited us from giving away our body so long as we perceive it as
something difficult to do; and how it will come to be nothing difficult to give
away our own body, since the Teacher has instructed us to do so only when
we have become so accustomed to giving away things that we view it as
something similar to giving away vegetables.

Here is the first. Consider the hardships that one must undertake to achieve
enlightenment. The Supreme Physician, the Lord of the Able Ones, does not
perform these treatments of his in a way that's like those other, ordinary ones that
are used to cure some illness. Rather he uses a particular kind of technique or
method that's gentle in the extreme, a blissful path to reach a blissful goal. It is
a path which avoids both extremes: it neither leaves one spent and exhausted,
nor leads to the thoughtless consumption of resources. He uses it to cure the

massive and infinite ills of the mental afflictions, which force us to continue
wandering in the circle of suffering. It could never be right then for you to
fear these spiritual hardships.

Here is the second. At the beginning--meaning until such time as we become
more familiar with the perfection of giving--the Guide directs us to begin our
acts of charity with deeds such as giving away pressed scraps of dough, or
vegetables, and anything of the like. Once we have grown accustomed to these and
thus overcome our tendency to think of such acts as something difficult, then
gradually, in good time, we find that we can offer even our flesh. This is another
reason.

Here is the third. There comes a point when, because we have accustomed
ourselves to these acts as just described, we reach a state of mind where we can
view giving away our bodies just like we view giving away the vegetables and
such. At that stage then why is it we would feel it difficult at all to offer our flesh
or the rest? We wouldn't feel the least difficulty at all. And so it is wrong for
you to feel any kind of fear for undertaking the hardships of a bodhisattva.

Bodhisattvas who have reached the point where their thoughts of compassion
are completely pure feel no pain in their bodies when they give them away.
This is the case since they have stopped each and every kind of bad deed. Neither
when they give their bodies away is there any kind of dislike for the act, because
they are wise in knowing when it is right for them to do so.
This is due to the fact--this is caused by the reason--that thinking of things the
wrong way (believing that a person or the things which belong to a person
could ever have any self-nature), along with doing negative deeds such as taking
life and the rest, harm the body and mind; and great bodhisattvas have managed
to stop these sources of harm.

king uses his four armed forces to destroy those who oppose him; just so, we
must make use of four forces that provide support for our practice of effort.
The first of these is the force of will, where first we contemplate the laws of
actions and their consequences, which helps us then to develop a strong
aspiration to give up the things that we should give up, and take up those
which we should take up.

MA BRTAGS PAR CI RUNG RUNG DU MI 'JUG LA BRTAGS NAS ZHUGS PA MTHAR 'BYIN PA BRTAN PA'I STOBS DANG ,
Next is the force of steadfastness. Here we learn not to engage unexamined in
just any activity that presents itself, but rather to analyze the activity first, then
engage in it, and finally to bring it to a successful conclusion.

Third is the force of joy, where we put forth a kind of effort which never takes
a break, and is never satisfied; where we act like a child playing a game.
Finally there is the force of leaving off, where we apply effort until our body or
mind becomes tired; then we rest and refresh ourselves, and rise to make
efforts again as soon as we have recovered.

,MOS PA'I STOBS LA MTSON TE BSHAD NA MOS PA'I STOBS NI 'KHOR BA'I SDUG BSNGAL GYIS 'JIGS PA DANG , MOS PA DE'I PHAN YON BSAM PAS BSKYED PAR BYA'O,
We will explain these forces in more detail by taking the force of will as a
model. It should be developed by learning to fear the pain of the circle of
suffering, and by engaging in the contemplation of the benefits that this same will
gives to us.

We must eliminate then what acts against us: one tendency of not engaging in
some good activity even when we see that we are capable of accomplishing it,
and another tendency of feeling incapable, of thinking to ourselves, "How
could I ever do that?" We must work hard to cultivate the qualities that support
effort--to use the four, the various forces of will, confidence (which refers to being
steadfast), joy, and also leaving off.
As we actually perform our good deeds we must be engaged in our effort, in the
sense of utilizing recollection. After this we must try hard to use the force of
a feeling of self-command, control of our body and mind, in order to increase our
capacity for effort to increasingly higher levels.

The sixth chapter of the sutra known as the Victory Banner of Diamond, which
belongs to the "majority" section of scripture, includes the following passage:
We can give, oh son of the gods, the example of the rising sun.
Its shining is in no way stopped by the fact that some people
might be blind, or that a line of mountain tops might be uneven,
or any other such problem. It simply lights up any area which
is ready to receive the light. Just so do bodhisattvas shine, for
the sake of others, and their shining is in no way stopped by the
various problems that individual living beings might have. They
simply act to ripen, and to liberate, any disciple who is ready to
receive their light.
We must utilize the technique described here to practice the kind of confidence that
is required to bring to a successful conclusion any particular virtuous activity,
once one has begun it.

At the very beginning, as you first engage in any particular action, you must
appraise yourself well, to see if you have the mental resources, or ability, that will
be needed. If you find that you do have the ability, then should you decide to
act; but if you find that you do not possess this ability, then you should decide
not to act. The very highest thing to do would be not even to start a thing; but once
you have begun, then you should never allow yourself to stop until you have
brought the activity to a successful conclusion.

,DANG PO NI, GZHAN GYIS BYA BAR 'OS PA'I LAS MTHONG NA BDAG NYID GCIG PUS BYA'O ZHES BLO'I STOBS BSKYED PA 'DI NI LAS KYI NGA RGYAL NYID DO,
Here is the first point, which is identifying the confidence of accomplishment.
Suppose you see someone else undertaking some worthy activity. The
confidence of accomplishment is when you raise the mental power to say to
yourself, "I am willing to do this thing all by myself."

Next is the second point, which is the reason why we should feel this
confidence. You must undertake deeds for the benefit of living beings without
depending on others to help you. This is because the inhabitants of the entire
world live at the mercy of their mental afflictions, and are therefore incapable of
helping even themselves at all. Given this fact, beings can't do what I can do, in
making efforts at good deeds for the sake of others. Even if I did try to rely
on them for help then it would be useless, and thus you must think to yourself,
"I'll be the one to do what must be done for the sake of others."

One should raise the power of the antidotes, in order to destroy one's mental
affliction. If he encounters a snake that's dead already, then even the small crow can
emulate the deeds of that great mythical bird, the garuda. The situation with me

is the same: suppose that I continue to act like a weakling in the level of strength
with which I apply the antidotes. Even a minor slip in a vow will be able to lay
an obstacle in the path, and thus do me damage. This will lead me to
discouragement, and then eventually I will lose my ability to make efforts
towards achieving the goals of myself and others. And how could I really think
I could ever be free then, living in such destitution? How could it ever come,
where laziness has destroyed me, and torn down all the efforts I make with my
body and mind?

Those of confidence never become
Slaves of the enemy, pride;

Those whose hearts are filled up with
The affliction of pride are by this thought
Dragged to the lower realms;
The feast of a human life is too

Here is the first point, which is a denunciation of pride, an afflicted kind of
confidence. Any particular individual who has been wasted and destroyed by
arrogant confidence or pride has become a slave of the mental afflictions, and
so the emotion they have is not something we consider the magnificent kind
of confidence. It's simply not the case that those people who possess this kind
of confidence could ever become slaves that belong to the enemy. Others though,
those whose hearts are filled with arrogance, have turned to slaves of pride, a
confidence which has become a mental affliction.

The second point covers the problems caused by pride. Those whose hearts are
filled up with the affliction of pride encounter the following problems. They are
first of all dragged by this thought of pride to the lower realms. And even if they
do manage to take birth as a human, then the feast of a human life--meaning all
kinds of contentment and the like--is too destroyed for them; they have nothing
to eat, and must support themselves by begging.
They find themselves controlled by others, and as servants then they must eat
crumbs from another's table. Their minds turn stupid, their appearance ugly, and
they always feel uncertain of themselves. Every person they meet abuses them in
every way, physically and verbally, even though they themselves have done
no harm to these people directly. As such we must give up this arrogant
confidence, pride.

Here is the first point, on developing the power of the antidotes to mental
affliction. When you find yourself in the camp of the enemy, surrounded by the
mental afflictions of anger and the rest, you must look for a thousand ways,
different methods, to shield yourself from them with the power of spiritual
antidotes. Be for example like a lion, which never lets foxes and other such
animals to touch it; never allow the mass of mental afflictions to break through to
you.

The second point is on assuring that we never become even the least bit
influenced by mental afflictions. Suppose a person finds themselves in the middle
of a forsaken desert; that is, suppose they find themselves threatened seriously
by the mental afflictions. Still they try to act to protect their eyes, which they
consider so very precious to them. You may be the same, and find yourself hard
pressed, in the sense of being on the verge of surrending yourself to your
mental afflictions. But you should never allow these mental afflictions to become
your master.

sake of others: this work of studying and contemplating, and then meditating
upon the wish for enlightenment. We should try to reach a point where we
become insatiable in seeking this work; and where we want do it continuously,
without a break; in short, we should take great joy in it.

People in the world spend their time with farming and other kinds of work for

no certainty that what they do will ever end up making them happy; there is no
guarantee that by doing these things they will reach any kind of happiness.
There does though exist a single kind of work, the activities of bodhisattvas,
"their own," which invariably makes you happy, in both a temporal and an
ultimate way. How can you ever be happy if you fail to do this particular kind of
work? It will never happen.

Consider the various objects of desire: visual objects, sounds, and so on. They
are just like honey smeared on a razor blade--if you lick the blade you might
experience a hint of good taste, but then you suffer as it slices open your
tongue. No matter how much you have of these sense objects here in the circle
of suffering, you can never feel satisfied.
Now consider the various deeds of merit: giving and the rest. They are
happiness in that they allow you to reach short-term types of karmic fruits or
results--an exceptional type of birth in the higher realms, life as a worldly
pleasure being or human. And ultimately they allow you to achieve as well the
happiness of peace, of having put to rest each and every suffering that there is.
Why is it that, at the same time as you are never satisfied with sense objects, you
are always content with the sum of the merit you have for reaching these other
kinds of happiness?

Here is the first point, which is throwing ourselves into the practice of
carefulness. Suppose you have an enemy who is "seasoned in war," meaning
one who has mastered the use of weapons and the arts of conflict. Think of the
blade of a sword that this enemy thrusts in your direction during a duel; you do all
you can to evade his sword yourself, and in addition whatever you can to
strike back with your own weapon. In just this way you must evade the sword
of the mental afflictions, and stop it. You must see to it that the afflictions never
destroy you, and seek rather to deliver a death blow to these foes with the sword
of the antidotes that stop these afflictions; that is, you must rip the afflictions
out of your mind from their root.

The second point concerns throwing ourselves into the practice of recollection
and awareness. Imagine yourself in the midst of a battle, and that your sword has
slipped from your hand. You would race in fear to take it up again, out of terror
that the other person is about to kill you. And just so, you may find that the
blade of recollection--the ability to avoid forgetting whatever virtuous object you
wish to focus upon--slips away from you. At that moment you must recall the
terrors of taking a birth in the hells, terrors that will come to you once your
mental afflictions have wrought their destruction upon you. And then you
must recover the antidote, your recollection, quickly.

Here is the third point, which is how recollection and awareness leave no
opening for problems to arise. Imagine now that someone has shot you with
a poison arrow, and that the poison is making its way throughout your entire body,
riding upon the blood as it courses through your veins. Just so do the various
mental afflictions, such as losing your recollection, act should they find any
opening to do so. And when they do find an opening, then the different
negativities of anger and the rest make their way throughout the entire mind. For
this reason you must try to stop even the slightest mental affliction whenever
it should arise.

"How can I learn to concentrate on this?" you may ask. Suppose a person handed
you a bowl completely full of oil, and made you walk down a slippery path.
Suppose then that they stood before you holding a sword, threatening to take your
life should you spill even a single drop. Out of complete fear, you would try your
utmost to concentrate. Those of you who are ascetics in the sense of attempting
to follow the life of a bodhisattva must be like this; you must concentrate by
keeping tight hold on your recollection, aimed at the various antidotes such as
the wish for enlightenment, and the like.

to accompany Reading Six
iv) Why it is right for us to feel glad over the treatment of our great
illness, since it involves no pain at all, but rather causes our
happiness to flourish
a1. How, despite the fact that spiritual hardships may bring
physical and mental discomfort to those persons who are not
well versed in the stages required for practicing the path, they
cause no pain to those who are well versed
[Contemplation Fourteen is found here]
b1. Why great bodhisattvas therefore have no reason to feel any
distaste for living in the cycle of suffering
c1. How, for this reason, one is said to be better versed in
travelling the path than those of the lower way
d1. Why it is therefore wrong to feel discouraged about engaging

Course XI: Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life, Part II
Reading Seven: Contemplations on the Perfection of Meditation,
Part I
The following contemplations are based on the Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way
of Life (Bodhisattvacharyavatara; Byang-chub-sems-dpa'i spyod-pa la 'jug-pa) of the
Buddhist master Shantideva (circa 700 AD), and the commentary upon it by
Gyaltsab Je Darma Rinchen (1364-1432) entitled Entry Point for Children of the
Victorious Buddhas (rGyal-sras 'jug-ngogs). The relevant sections are found at
folios 23A-26B and 89A-99A, respectively, in the ACIP electronic editions
TD3871 and S5436.
The content of the contemplations is translated directly from the root text and
commentary; the names of the contemplations are not a part of the original
text, but are based on the divisions of Gyaltsab Je's commentary and have been
supplied for reference. Each lesson is accompanied by the full detailed outline
for the section from Gyaltsab Je's commentary.
************
Contemplation One
Quietude

,DE LTAR BRTZON 'GRUS BSKYED NAS NI,
,YID NI TING NGE 'DZIN LA 
BZHAG,SEMS NI RNAM PAR GA YENGS PA'I MI,
,NYON MONGS MCHE BA'I PHRAG NA GNAS,
Once you've developed your practice of effort
In the way described above, then place
Your mind in single-pointedness.
A person whose mind is in a state
Of constantly wandering lives his life
In the jaws of mental affliction.

,LUS DANG SEMS NI DBEN PA YIS,
,RNAM PAR G-YENG BA MI 'BYUNG NGO ,
This constant wandering never occurs
With those who remain in isolation
Of body and the mind.

SNGAR BSHAD PA DE LTAR DGE BA LA SPRO BA'I BRTZON 'GRUS BSKYED NAS NI, YID NI TING NGE 'DZIN LA GZHAG PAR BYA STE BYING RGOD KYIS SEMS NI RNAM PAR G-YENG BA'I MI NYON MONGS PA GCAN GZAN GDUG PA DANG 'DRA BA'I MCHE BA'I PHRAG NA GNAS TE, DES NI MYUR DU 'JOMS PAS SO,
Now once you've developed your practice of effort--your joy over doing good
things--in the way it was described in the explanation above, then you must learn
to place your mind in single-pointed meditation. A person whose mind is in a state
of constantly wandering, due to mental dullness or restlessness, lives his life in the
jaws of mental affliction, which is so much like a great and dangerous wild beast.
The point is that such a person is very close to being destroyed completely.

,RNAM G-YENG JI LTAR SPANG ZHE NA LUS DANG SEMS NI 'DU 'DZI DANG 'DOD PA'I RNAM RTOG SOGS KYIS DBEN PA YIS TING NGE 'DZIN GYI MI MTHUN PHYOGS RNAM PAR G-YENG BA MI 'BYUNG NGA O,
"How is it," one may ask, "that I can learn to eliminate this wandering state of
mind?" The answer is that this constant wandering--the enemy of single-pointed
concentration-- never occurs with those who remain in isolation of body and mind;
meaning with those who are able to keep themselves from the hustle and
bustle of life physically, as well as from thoughts of desire and the like.

Contemplation Two
Attachment to the world

,CHAGS PA'I PHYIR DANG RNYED SOGS LA,
,SRED PAS 'JIG RTEN MI SPONG STE,
People are unable to give up the world
Because of their attachment, and craving for
Material gain and the like.

BDAG DANG BDAG GIR ZHEN PA LA BRTEN NAS NANG SEMS CAN LA CHAGS PA'I PHYIR DANG , PHYI RNYED PA DANG , BKUR STI TSIGS SU BCAD PA SOGS LA SRED PAS 'JIG RTEN GYI ZHEN PA MI SPONGS TE, DE BAS ZHEN PA'I RGYU DE DAG SPANG BAR BYA'O,
People are unable to give up their craving for the world first because of their
attachment inward to their own being, an attachment which grows from their
belief in an independent "me" and "mine." And on the outside the cause is
their craving for material gain, or for being honored by others, or for words of
praise, and the like. This being the case, we should strive to eliminate these
various causes of craving.

Contemplation Three
Stopping attachment

,ZHI GNAS RAB TU LDAN PA'I LHAG MTHONG GIS,
,NYON MONGS RNAM PAR 'JOMS PAR SHES BYAS NAS,
,THOG MAR ZHI GNAS BTZAL BYA DE YANG NI,
,'JIG RTEN CHAGS PA MED LA MNGON DAGS 'GRUB,
Understand first the fact that vision
Married close to quietude
Destroys the mental afflictions.
Begin then by seeking quietude;
It in turn is achieved by the bliss
Of losing attachment for the world.

DGE BA'I DMIGS PA GANG LA RTZE GCIG PA GOMS PAR BYAS PAS BYING RGOD DANG BRAL TE, LUS SEMS SHIN TU SBYANGS PA'I BDE BA 'DREN PA'I ZHI GNAS KYI RTA DANG RAB TU LDAN PA'I STONG NYID RTOGS PA'I LHAG MTHONG GIS KHAMS GSUM GYI NYON MONGS PA SA BON DANG BCAS PA RNAM PAR 'JOMS PAR SHES PAR BYAS NAS GNAS LUGS KYI DON LA DPYAD PA BYAS PA'I STOBS KYIS SHIN SBYANGS 'DREN NUS PA'I LHAG MTHONG BSGRUB PAR BYA LA DE LA YANG THOG MAR ZHI GNAS BTZAL BAR BYA STE ZHI GNAS SNGON DU MA BSGRUB PAR LHAG MTHONG SKYE MI SRID PA'I PHYIR RO,
You should understand first the following fact. Meditative quietude consists of
practicing a state of single-pointedness upon some virtuous object until one has
been able to eliminate mental restlessness and dullness from the mind; this
then brings on a kind of bliss caused by the extreme manageability of the body
and mind. This quietude is like a horse married to its rider, which is the special
vision of realizing emptiness. The combination of the two then is able to destroy
completely every mental affliction of the three realms, along with the seeds for
these afflictions. Since this is the case, you must seek to achieve a special
vision which brings on the state of manageability, which itself occurs through
being able to analyze the true nature of existence. To achieve this vision
though you must first begin by seeking meditative quietude, for it is impossible to
develop special vision without first achieving this quietude.

,ZHI GNAS DE YANG NI PHYI NANG GI 'JIG RTEN GYI LUS LONGS SPYOD SOGS LA CHAGS PA MED PAS MNGON PAR DGA' BAS 'GRUB STE, DE DAG LA CHAGS PAS BYING RGOD KYI DBANG DU 'GRO BA'I PHYIR RO,
It--this quietude--is in turn achieved by a feeling of bliss, which is caused by
losing one's attachment to the world, in both the inner and the outer sense; that
is, attachment to the body, to possessions, and so on. The reason for this is
that attachment to these things makes us slaves of mental restlessness and
dullness.

Contemplation Four
The rewards of attachment

,MI RTAG SU ZHIG MI RTAG LA,
,YANG DAG CHAGS PAR BYED PA YOD,
,DES NI TSE RABS STONG PHRAG TU,
,SDUG PA MTHONG BAR YONG MI 'GYUR,
How is it that one so impermanent
Could ever feel such sheer attachment
For other impermanent things?
This will prevent you for a thousand
Future lives from seeing anything
Beautiful at all.

DANG PO LA GNYIS, CHAGS PA'I NYES DMIGS DANG , NYES DMIGS SHES NAS SPANG BA'O, , DANG PO LA LNGA, 'DOD PA'I DON DANG MI PHRAD PA DANG , 'DOD YON GYIS G-YEN SPYO BA DANG , THOB KYANG CHOG MI SHES PA DANG , THAR PA LA GEGS BYED PA DANG , DAL 'BYOR CHUD GSON PA'O, , DANG PO NI,
Here is the first point, which is giving up inner attachment, to the person. This
will be covered in two steps of explaining the problems caused by attachment,
and then describing how to give up attachment, now that we have understood
the problems it causes. The first step itself has five different parts, on the facts
that we will not encounter the things we wish for; that we will be diverted by
the objects of the senses; that, even if we achieve what we seek, we will never
be satisfied; that we will be blocked from attaining freedom; and that we will
waste our spiritual opportunity and fortune. Here is the first of the five.

CHAGS PA'I NYES DMIGS NI RANG NYID MYUR DU 'CHI BA'I MI RTAG PA SU ZHIG GNYEN BSHES SOGS MI RTAG PA LA YANG DAG PAR CHAGS PAR BYED PA YOD SDUG PA LA CHAGS PA DES NI 
RNAM SMIN TSE RABS STONG PHRAG TU YANG 'DOD PA'I YUL SDUG PA MTHONG BAR YONG STE GTAN NAS MTHONG BAR MI 'GYUR RO,
Here are some of the problems caused by attachment. How is it that anyone so
impermanent as myself, someone who is very soon to die, could ever feel such
sheer attachment for other impermanent things, such as friends and relatives? This
attachment to things that I find attractive will have a certain karmic
consequence: it will prevent me for even so long as a thousand future lives from
seeing anything, any object, which is beautiful at all; meaning it will stop me
completely from encountering these things.

Contemplation Five
Don't be with children

,RTAG PA MED PA'I MDZA' BSHES KYIS,
,G-YUNG DRUNG CHOS KYANG 'JIG PAR 'GYUR,
,BYIS DANG SKAL BA MNYAM SPYOD NA,
,NGES PAR NGAN 'GROR 'GRO 'GYUR TE,
,SKAL MI MNYAM PAR KHRID BYED NA,
,BYIS PA BSTEN PAS CI ZHIG BYA,
Those fleeting friends and relatives
Can bring to destruction even the Dharma,
That indestructible sphere.
If I spend my time with children
On my same level, then I will go
With certainty to the lower realms.
If being with them leads me down
To a different level, then why is it
I choose to stay with children?

MYUR DU 'BRAL BAS RTAG PA MED PA'I MDZA' BSHES KYIS MI 'GYUR BA'I G-YUNG DRUNG GI THAR PA DANG DE THOB PA'I THABS DAM PA'I CHOS KYANG 'JIG CING NYAMS PAR 'GYUR LA BYIS PA DANG SKAL BA MNYAM PA STE, DE DAG DANG SPYOD PA MTSUNGS PAR SPYOD NA NGES PAR NGAN 'GROR 'GRO BAR 'GYUR TE 'PHAGS PA RNAMS DANG DA LTA MI LUS THOB PA DANG SKAL BA MI MNYAM PAR 'KHRID PAR BYED NA, BYIS PA SO SO'I SKYE BO BSTEN PAS CI ZHIG BYA 'DOD DON MI 'GRUB CING MI 'DOD PA 'PHEL BA'I PHYIR RO,
My friends and relatives, those who are fleeting in the sense that I must quickly
be torn from them, can bring to destruction, and cause me to lose, even that
indestructible sphere of nirvana, along with the holy Dharma which is the means

of attaining this nirvana. And if I spend my time with children, on my same
level--which is to say, if I act the same way they do--then I will go with
certainty to the lower realms. If being with these children leads me down to a level
which is different from that of realized beings, and different from my current
state, where I have managed to attain a human body, then why is it that I choose
to stay with children? If I do I will never get the things I want, but rather see
the things I do not want continue to increase. [Note that "children" throughout
this section refers to persons who have yet to see emptiness directly, and who
are therefore not "realized beings" or aryas.]

Contemplation Six
On seeking to please the world

,SEMS CAN MOS PA SNA TSOGS PA,

Not even the victorious Buddhas possess
The ability to please all beings,
So different in their wishes.
Needless to say then someone as low

Give up all thought of the world.

People put down those who have
No money, and say bad things about
Those who do have money.
If their very nature is that they are
So difficult to be with, how then
Could I ever make them happy?

Not even the victorious Buddhas, who act on behalf of living kind through an
infinite variety of mighty deeds, possess the ability to please all beings, who are
so different in the things they wish for. Needless to say then someone as low as me,
someone who is incapable of reading these beings' minds, could never please
them either. Thus I should give up all thought of associating closely with worldly
kinds of people.

,SEMS CAN RNAMS NI GROGS RNYED PA MED PA LA 'DI NI SNGON BSOD NAMS MA BYAS PA'O ZHES 'PHYA ZHING SMOD LA, RNYED PA CAN LA LOG 'TSO SPYOD PA'O ZHES MI SNYAN PA BRJOD DO, , DE DAG GI RANG BZHIN 'GROGS DKA' BA YIN PA DE BAS NA BYIS PA DE DAG GIS BDAG LA DGA' BA JI LTAR SKYE BAR 'GYUR, MI 'GYUR BAS 'GROGS PAR MI BYA'O,
People tend to criticize and put down those of their friends who have no money,
saying things like "He or she must not have done any good deeds in the past."
And they also say bad things about those who do have money, like "They must have
gotten it through some kind of wrong livelihood." If their very nature is that
they are so difficult to be with, then how could I ever make these children happy with
me? I never could, so let me not be around them.

Contemplation Seven

Animals, nor the birds, nor trees,
Ever say something unpleasant.

May I come to live in a cave somewhere,
Or in some abandoned temple, or else

Here is the first point, concerning the companions I will have when I go into
isolation. Wise men, those who are possessed of great learning, should give
up on the idea of being close to children, and go to live in the forest. When you
live in the forest, neither the wild animals, nor the birds, nor the trees ever say
something unpleasant to you, and thus these new friends are so very easy to live
with. As such you should make a prayer to yourself, as follows: "May there
come a day when I may stay living together with them."

Here is the second point, on where I should go into isolation. Make to yourself
the following prayer as well: "May I come to live exactly as I please, in a cave
somewhere, or in some hollow, or perhaps in some abandoned temple, or else at the
foot of a forest tree. May the day never come that I look back at all, when I think of
the home and other things that I used to have and then gave up; may I never
get any wish at all to have them back. May I reach, in short, a place where I've
finished with every kind of attachment for any of these things."

Make to yourself then a final prayer, one in which you say to yourself, "May
I one day live on some land that no one else thinks is something that they own, on
land that is by nature open and wide. May I stay there living free to do whatever I
please, and totally free of feelings of attachment for anything at all, whether it be
my body, or possessions, or anything of the like."

You reach a place where there's no friend
Nor anyone for your suspicions;
Your body lives in isolation, alone.

Here is the first part, on why it is right for wise people to go into isolation.
Birth never ends in anything but death, and so the hour will come when those of
the world, meaning my friends and relatives, are wrapped in grief, and four strong
men come to lift my corpse up and lead me forward on a stretcher from "that place,"
meaning from my home. May I come to pass all of my days from this moment on
up till that final hour living in isolation, deep in the woods.

Here is the second part, on the benefits of going into isolation. This part has
three sections of its own, on the fact that if you go into isolation you will never
be tormented by grief, or anything of the like; how your virtuous side will
never degenerate, but rather continue to increase; and why therefore it is
something very right for each of us to go into isolation. Here is the first of the
three.

One may ask the following question: "Just what are the benefits that one gets
from going to live in the forest?" If you do so, then you reach a place where
there's no friend over whom you can begin to feel attachment or anger. Nor is
there anyone to raise your suspicions that they might do you some kind of harm.
Your body lives in isolation, alone; there comes a day when, because you have
already abandoned all your friends and relatives, you consider yourself as if you
were already dead. And since you have stopped your attachment, then there's
no one at all to feel grief even when death itself arrives.

Exhausting their material wealth as well.

Think of those objects you hold in your arms
To find your feelings of ecstasy;
These very same things are nothing more

And believe in a thing which is helpless,
A thing which has never possessed
Any nature of being itself?

Here is the first point, which is how there is no result you gain from tasting
pleasure. Men and women lovers, looking to get the thing that they
want--someone to set up a household with--make their propositions over and
over to one another, begging with the words, "My name is such-and-such, and
I want you to live with me." And so too for this thing, for a woman, men avoid
no evil deed, nor any loss of their own reputation, throwing it all away for her.
They engage moreover as well even in actions which are dangerous for them, things
that will hurt them physically and the like, and for this same goal exhaust their
material wealth as well.

These very same things, these bodies, are nothing more than simple skeletons. Why
do you pass up travelling on to nirvana, choosing instead to crave and believe from
your heart in a thing which is helpless at the mercy of other conditions, a thing
which has never possessed any nature of being itself, despite the fact that you hold
it to? You must give up these things you crave for, and make great efforts in
practicing the path to freedom.

Here is the second point, which describes how--in the end--there is never
anything more to life than being discarded upon the burial ground. At the
beginning, when she is still new to you, you strive with great desire to raise up
the veil which covers the face of some woman; and even should you reveal this
face, she looks demurely to the ground. You must go though in advance to the
burial ground, where the faces are wrapped in cloth regardless of whether someone
wants to look or not. Think of the lovely face that stands right now exposed to your
sight, the object of the afflictions of your mind. When she dies the vultures in the
cemetery will come and reveal to you, they will lift the cloth and show you very
clearly, that very same thing. Why is it then that you turn and run, you flee, when
you see such a face in the graveyard? You should have just as much
attachment for it after death as you do before.

And so our entire planet is chaos, and filled to overflowing, covered, with people
who are madmen, mad with a madness created by the error brought to their
minds by the mental afflictions, by the struggle of ignorance with some so-called
"self." You know your heart fails, and you think of your own body in a
graveyard, whenever you go to a burial ground and see nothing there but stacks of
sun-dried bones. Why then is it that you take such pleasure here in the city, a
cemetery covered as it is with bones driven into motion, goaded into moving, by
nothing more than will power? You should feel no such pleasure at all.

Here is the first point, which concerns the fact that we will have no
opportunity to enjoy the thing we wanted. Certain children, during their
younger days, find themselves unable to build up the wealth they want in order
to attract a woman. What then as adults will they have to make them happy, since
they have not been able to attract this person? Suppose that then, during their
adult years, they devote their lives to collecting money; they'll only have gotten old
in their bodies, so what then will they be able to do with--how will they be able
to enjoy--this thing they wanted so badly?

The second point concerns how the suffering of exhaustion prevents us from
enjoying the thing we wanted. Some poor souls who live for things, working
people and the like, go and exhaust themselves, their bodies, completely by laboring
the entire day. At night then they come back home and throw their bodies, as
dissipated then as corpses, on their beds and fall asleep. They don't even have time
to think about this person they were working to get, and have no time to enjoy
them either.

The third point addresses how, because of the geographic distance that
separates us from the thing we wanted, it is difficult for us to make contact
with it. Some people are sent away on missions by those in charge of them; they
are distressed by this, and go through different sufferings far away from their homes.
They start then to have a craving for a woman, but in the course of a very long
time, such as an entire year, cannot even lay their eyes on one, much less act out
their desires.

The fourth and final point describes how, because we will live at the mercy of
others, many things will come to us that we do not want. There are certain ones
who hope to bring some good to themselves, but who are ignorant about the proper
method for doing so. They go out to sell their own bodies for the purpose of
some material gain or the like. They fail though to attain the thing they wanted,
they fail to get the payment they hoped for, and then they are driven on like a
feather by the wind of work for others which--for them at least--is meaningless,
in that nothing comes of it for themselves. They thus come to experience great
suffering in both this and their future lives, and are never able to get the thing
that they wanted.

Here is the first point, which describes how attachment steals our freedom, and
forces us quickly to give up our lives. Some go and barter their very bodies into
the service of others, thus losing their freedom and becoming slaves who must act
at the bidding of others. The women here with them get pregnant and, since they
have no home of their own, must bear their children--go through their
labor--wherever they can, at the foot of a tree, or in some protected hollow.

Some fools, deceived by thoughts of desire and hoping that they will thus be able to
live on for a long time, say to themselves, "I need these material things to support
myself." Then in order to obtain the things they march to engage in battle,
where you never know if you'll have to give up your own life. For profit thus
they go to serve as servants, and force themselves to undergo an entire range
of pain.

Here is the second part, which describes how attachment makes us slaves, and
exposes us to a constant stream of a great variety of sufferings. In this world
we also see others driven by desire who, for the sake of the things they desired,
end up being cut to pieces; or else others who for the same sake are impaled--as
a punishment for crime--the entire length of their bodies upon a pole; or still
others who are pierced throughout with spears, or stabbed with swords or the
like; and yet others who are even tortured and burned alive in fire as well.

You must come to understand then how money is forever the very root of an
endless waste of life, in the torment it causes you as you try to collect it, and then
try to keep it, and finally come to lose it.

The Asian Classics Institute
Course XI: Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life, Part II
Reading Eight: Contemplations on the Perfection of Meditation,
Part II
The following contemplations are based on the Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way
of Life (Bodhisattvacharyavatara; Byang-chub-sems-dpa'i spyod-pa la 'jug-pa) of the
Buddhist master Shantideva (circa 700 AD), and the commentary upon it by
Gyaltsab Je Darma Rinchen (1364-1432) entitled Entry Point for Children of the
Victorious Buddhas (rGyal-sras 'jug-ngogs). The relevant sections are found at
folios 26B-27A and 99B-101B, respectively, in the ACIP electronic editions
TD3871 and S5436.
The content of the contemplations is translated directly from the root text and
commentary; the names of the contemplations are not a part of the original
text, but are based on the divisions of Gyaltsab Je's commentary and have been
supplied for reference. Each lesson is accompanied by the full detailed outline
for the section from Gyaltsab Je's commentary.

We spend our days in gentle walks and thoughts
Of helping others, here in the silent
Peace of the forest, flowing in soft breezes;
We live doing as we please in our mansion
Of a wide flat rock, cool with the touch
Of moonlight and sandalwood scent of the holy,
Living deep within the woods
Of peacefulness, completely emptied
Of conflict and the afflictions.

Here is the first point, which describes one of the feature of living in isolation:
that the place and so on are so perfectly excellent. "If I go into isolation," you
may ask, "where should it be?" Think of a wheel-empowered emperor, who
has no one at all to compete with him, and who revels in the objects of the
senses at his own complete leisure. Just like this emperor do we live, deep
within the woods of peacefulness, at rest from all the various distractions, in a
place completely emptied of both any outer conflict and any kind of mental
affliction--completely free of any of the objects that could trigger within us
emotions such as liking or disliking another person.
We live doing as we please under some very wide, flat rock as a roof, which is just
like a mansion for us. The place is cool, made cool by the touch of sweet
sandalwood scent smeared all over--the soft moonlight of the presence of the holy
beings who have stayed there in the past.
Here the forest is silent, with no kinds of sound to clash with our thoughts, and
peaceful with the soft velvet breezes that flow past to grace the ground of our
meditation. We spend our days here in gentle walks, and thoughts of things we can
do that will help others--in the practice of the wish for enlightenment. And so
it is, that when great practitioners go into isolation, the pleasure they feel is
infinitely greater than anything felt by those who follow the worldly way of
life.

Here is the second point, that another benefit I will achieve from living in
isolation is my independence. In isolation we live where we please, and as long
as we like, in places where there are no other people: in abandoned houses, or in
caves, or else at the foot of a tree. We have given up both the suffering of owning
many different material things, and the suffering of trying to protect these things
from being lost. In short, we live carefree, relying on nothing: no hopes, and no
plans.

well, in order to contemplate the benefits of living in some faraway place, isolated
from the hustle and bustle of life and other such distractions. Put a complete

"What is the method," you may ask, "which I should use to meditate upon this
wish?" You should, from the very beginning, exert yourself in the practice of
treating others and yourself the same. "And how do I do that?" you may ask. We
spend our time working to achieve happiness for ourselves, and working to
stop any suffering for ourselves. We must learn to act just the same way
towards the happiness and the sufferings of others; we should make our
attempts to achieve happiness and to stop suffering the same, for both ourselves
and others. When we do so, then we will come to care for and cherish all living
beings just as we do ourselves.

One may make the following objection:
I don't see how it could be the right thing to do to act towards
the happiness and the sufferings of others exactly the same as I
do towards those of my own; the reason I say this is that the

number of living beings is absolutely infinite, and there is no way
that I could ever think "me" about every one of them.
Think though about the many separate parts of your body: your feet, your hands,
and all the rest. Even though there are many of these parts, we think of them all
as "mine," and care dearly for all of them, as the single body of a single person.
The various different types of beings--worldly gods, humans, and the like--are
just so. Even though they are separate, there is no distinction between their
individual joys and their individual pains: I can learn to view them as
indistinguishable, and then conceive of all of them as if they were my own self,
just as I conceive of myself as myself. The point here is that I could learn to
think about every one of them in the same way, and say to myself, "I shall work
to achieve this particular happiness," and "I shall work to stop this particular
suffering."

One may make yet another objection:
Two facts here are the same: the pain that others have doesn't
hurt me; and the pain that I have doesn't hurt others. Therefore
you are incorrect when you say that I should make very
intentional efforts to remove their pain in exactly the same way
that I make efforts to remove my own pain.
Yet there is no such problem in our reasoning. Suppose you do object this way,
and say that your pain never hurts the body of another, any more than their pain
hurts you. Even so, their pain is your pain. This is because your own pain is
something you find unbearable for just one reason: your habit of grasping to yourself
as yourself.
Suppose that, just so, you become accustomed to considering others yourself
as well. Even though it may be true then that the sufferings which others feel may
never come and strike you personally, still the suffering that these living beings
feel is your suffering to work to remove, since you'll find it hard to bear it when
sufferings come to them, once you have learned to grasp to them as being
yourself.

Course XI: Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life, Part II
Reading Nine: Contemplations on the Perfection of Meditation,
Part III
The following contemplations are based on the Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way
of Life (Bodhisattvacharyavatara; Byang-chub-sems-dpa'i spyod-pa la 'jug-pa) of the
Buddhist master Shantideva (circa 700 AD), and the commentary upon it by
Gyaltsab Je Darma Rinchen (1364-1432) entitled Entry Point for Children of the
Victorious Buddhas (rGyal-sras 'jug-ngogs). The relevant sections are found at
folios 27A-28B and 101B-106A, respectively, in the ACIP electronic editions
TD3871 and S5436.
The content of the contemplations is translated directly from the root text and
commentary; the names of the contemplations are not a part of the original
text, but are based on the divisions of Gyaltsab Je's commentary and have been
supplied for reference. Each lesson is accompanied by the full detailed outline
for the section from Gyaltsab Je's commentary.

Suppose you say the following: "The reason why I don't try to protect all living
beings from their suffering is that when this pain comes to them it doesn't hurt
to me personally." This though is totally wrong. According to this way of
thinking, it must be a mistake for people to try to accumulate money during
their younger years out of a concern that they will undergo some kind of
suffering during their later years; or for any one of us to try to find some way
today, or this morning, to prevent some suffering that we think may come to
us tomorrow, or later in the day. Why then do you try to protect yourself from
some future pain, from some suffering that you are afraid might come later, since
it doesn't do any hurt to you, to the person who exists at the earlier point in
time, either? According to your way of thinking, it must be incorrect to do so.

Someone may give the following reply:
If in this life I fail to stop the causes that are going to bring me
suffering in my later lives, then I myself will have to experience
that suffering in my later life. As such, it is quite appropriate

that I make efforts in the various methods of stopping these
causes.
Here you have an idea that you must do so because you think to yourself that the
you in this life will have to experience the pain in their future lives; but your idea
is all wrong. This is because the person who in this case has already died is one
person, and the one who's taken birth in the future lives is another altogether; it's
completely wrong to say that these two are one and the same.

By the way, the logic presented here is meant to refute the idea that, because
two people are separate entities, it is wrong to say that either one of them is
obliged to work to remove the suffering of the other. To accomplish this
refutation, we present a parallel example involving the two separate versions
of one person at successive points in time. It is not though the intent of the
root text here to deny the fact that, in an ultimate sense, the successive versions
of a person do constitute a single person.

And suppose further that the pain of any particular part of the body were only
something which that one particular part had to care about and try to remove. If
this were the case, then a pain caused in the foot when a thorn pierced it would be
nothing for the hand to worry about; why then would the hand care about the
suffering that the foot was undergoing? According to you it would be wrong
to do so.

Suppose you say now the following:
Although it is wrong to assert that two objects which are unrelated
should work to remove each other's suffering, here it's different.
In this case we assume that I have become accustomed to holding
to a particular self: I consider the bodies of the previous and
succeeding lives, and the bodies of the earlier part of the day and
the latter part of the day, and so on, to be one person. And it is
due to the fact that I have become accustomed to thinking this way
that one of these engages in attempting to remove the pain of the
other.
It is very wrong though to hold to the existence of this "self" and "other" which
are able to perform some action on their own. They are nothing but something
you should reject, with all the strength you have. This is because the tendency to
hold onto some self-nature of the person is mistaken in what it believes to
exist, and is responsible for causing every kind of devastation.

Here is the third point, which is disproving the objection of thinking that it is
wrong to engage in the practice of treating myself and others the same.
Someone may make the following objection:
The two cases are not the same; [in the former case, of myself
and others,] the two beings involved are separate and have no
connection. The feet and hands of any one person though are
one collection of parts, and the person in his younger and older
years, or else in his previous and succeeding lives, is one
continuum. Therefore in this latter case it is logical that one of
the members should undertake to remove the suffering of the
other, whereas in the former case it is not logical.
Isn't it true though that there is no collection, and no continuum either, which
can act on its own accord? Because isn't it the case that the things we call a
"continuum" and a "collection" are simply unreal, in being concepts applied to
multiple parts--just like the concepts of a string of things [such as a rosary of
beads, or a garland of flowers], or an army, or anything similar? Isn't a
continuum simply a concept applied to the combination of what came before
and what came later, and isn't a collection simply a concept applied to the
components that make it up? Aren't they both therefore unreal?

One may make an additional objection:
All those things which can be considered one of the things that
any one person possesses are things which that person controls,
and therefore the suffering of any one member is something that
another member must try to remove, even though these members
may be separate in either location or time.
That so-called "self" of any one person who has suffering though is something
which doesn't exist at all. So who is he then, this person who supposedly acts
on his own accord, that could ever control "it," meaning their own happiness
and pain? And how could these ever be anything that he controlled? The two
are completely equal in being neither.

Since this is true--that is, for the reason that the one who supposedly owns a pain
does not exist anyway--there can be no distinctions at all among then any of the
sufferings which myself and others experience. In a nominal sense though, in
a relative sense, we can speak of the sufferings of "myself" and "others," and
so we can say that it is "right to make efforts to remove the sufferings of
others, just as we strive to remove our own sufferings."

Here is the second more general point: a brief summary. Therefore, the pain
that someone else is feeling is something that I must rightly work to remove, for
the simple reason that it is a kind of pain. What use is it so say here that the
distinction between myself and others is something that is fixed? We must
undertake to eliminate each and every pain of every other person; you can't
therefore continue this argument of yours, where you keep asking why the pains
of all other beings are something you must stop, even though they don't do any
hurt to you. Your own pain is not something that you ever wanted; so if you're
going to stop it, then it is right that you must stop all of the pain that exists. But
if the pain of others is not something that you should remove, then your own
pain should be just like that of all other beings: meaning that your own pain then
would never be something that you should work to remove either. Given all
this, you must learn to cherish others just as you cherish yourself, and make
dedicated efforts to remove their suffering.

Why then do you say you cannot
Think of the bodies of other people
As being yourself as well?
There isn't any difficulty
In deciding that the bodies of others
Are your own body too.

One may continue with the following objection:
I could never come to think of another's body as "me," or of the
eye that belonged to another as being "my eye." How then could
I ever reach the state of mind where I learn to act towards other
people's happiness and suffering in exactly the same way that I
do towards my own?
If in saying this you assume that you have not yet accustomed yourself to the
idea, then we can agree that you never could reach this state of mind. By
accustoming yourself to the idea though, you have learned to think of, to grasp to,
a few drops of semen and blood that belong to other people--to your father and
mother--as being "me," yourself, even though there's no such thing as your "self"
at all. This is all done through the power of getting used to something. Why
then do you say that you cannot think of the bodies of other people as being yourself
as well? You should learn to think this way; if you get used to the idea, then
you will be able to reach that state of mind where you think of their bodies as
your own. Thus it is that we should contemplate carefully upon the great
benefits that come from cherishing other people, and strive as best we can to
remove their sufferings.

,'GYUR KHA CIG LAS DNGOS PO MED PAR GYUR KYANG NI ZHES PA'I TSIG RKANG MI 'BYUNG NGO ,
Incidentally the part of the verse that reads, "Even though there's no such thing
at all" is not found in some translations of the root text.

,DES NA BDAG GI LUS 'DI GCES PAR 'DZIN PA CHED DU BKAG NAS GZHAN DU YANG BZHAG PA DE LTAR GOMS NA DKA' BA MED PA BDAG GCES 'DZIN GOMS PA DANG 'DRA'O,
Thus it is that we should first resolve to stop our habit of cherishing our own
body, and come to decide that the bodies of others can be the object of this
cherishing too; if we get used to thinking this way, there's isn't any difficulty to
it, for it's just like the way that we have already gotten accustomed to
cherishing ourselves.

You must come to understand the following things. This habit of cherishing
yourself is the source of every negative personal quality, and so it is wrong, and
something you must focus great efforts upon to stop. But cherishing all other
living beings, on the other hand, is the source of every mass of goodness--it
is like a great ocean of fine qualities. As such you must make it your practice to
discard completely your habit of caring for yourself, and learn to "take on every other
being," in the sense of learning to cherish them.

Contemplation Twenty-Three
How far can we go?

,JI LTAR LAG PA LA SOGS PA,
,LUS KYI YAN LAG YIN 'DOD LTAR,
,DE BZHIN 'GRO BA'I YAN LAG TU,

When you think of your hands and such
You do consider them all a part
Of your body; so why then don't you
Consider every creature that has
A body as being one of the parts
Of the body of all living kind?

One may make yet another objection: "Living beings are infinite; I could never
manage to think of them all as being myself." Your own hands and such are
separate things; yet when you think of them you do consider them all something
you must care for, since they are all a part of your body. The different kinds of
living beings, even though they are many, are still something that you can get
used to cherishing; and if you do so, then you will come to cherish them as
you do your own body. So why then don't you consider every creature that has a
body as being one of the parts of the body of all living kind? The right thing to do
would be to consider them this way.

For that reason, you must get used to a state
Of mind where you protect all beings,
And to thoughts of compassion as well,
Protecting them just the same way that
You protect yourself even from
The very least unkind word.

Here is the first point, how getting used to cherishing others enables us to
exchange ourselves and others, and to put a stop to our delusions of grandeur.
Now suppose you say, "I could never get used to the state of mind where I
exchange myself and others." Think though of the fact that, because you've
gotten used to it, you are able to think of this body and say "it's mine," to hold it
this way even though it is something which does not have any self-nature of
being a person. Why do you say then that you could never learn to think of other
living beings as "me," even if you got used to cherishing them? If you do
accustom yourself to it, then you can with every certainty learn to think this
way. And if you could accustom yourself to this, to thinking of every living
being as yourself, then you would never feel that it was strange when you devoted
yourself to working for others; nor would you ever feel conceited about it.

Here is the second point, which is advice to make efforts in this practice
without hoping for any good karmic result. Think for example of when you eat
your dinner, for yourself. You don't expect any congratulations from yourself for
doing so. The case here is just the same. Consider how well you protect
yourself even from the very least unkind word that someone might ever say to you.

You must try to get used to having a state of mind where you protect all beings in
just the same way, from every pain; you must as well get used to thoughts of
compassion, for the reason that this is of infinite benefit.

Now because of your attachment for your body, caused by your failure to practice
exchanging yourself and others, you feel great feelings of fear even for little
frightening things like scorpions or snakes or the like. Since this body then is a
source of all this terror, who--that is, what wise person--then wouldn't despise it
like they would some hated enemy? This being the case, it is completely wrong
to cherish the body.

Because we cherish the body so much, we spend our days trying to find a
technique of curing those illnesses that it has--hunger, and thirst, and the rest. And
to do so we slaughter birds and fish, and wild beasts of the forest too. We also lay
in wait at crossroads, to ambush those who are travelling there, and steal the
belongings of others.
For it, for this body that we cherish so greatly, and for profit, and to win the
honor that others give to us, we would even kill our own parents: those who have
been of such immense benefit to us. We would steal also the things belonging to
the Triple Jewel, and for it, for this evil, pass on to burn for it in the hell known
as "Endless Torment." This being the case, what wise men could ever then desire
this body, in the sense of cherishing it, and care for it, and make onto it offerings?
Who is it that wouldn't see this body as the enemy, and who then would not disdain
it? We must then in every possible way stop this tendency to cherish the
body.

Thinking of yourself and saying,

Suppose that, under the influence of an attachment to our possessions, we
begin to think only of ourselves, saying, "If I give all my money and the rest of
my things to other people, then what will I have to use for myself?" This way
of thinking though is nothing but demonic, because like a demon it can only in
the end create terror for us. Suppose on the other hand that we begin to think
only of others, and to say, "If I use this for myself, then what will I have to give to
them?" This is the Dharma of the Angel, in that every good and perfect thing
comes from it.

Here is the fifth point, which is part of the expanded explanation in a listing
of the respective problems and benefits of cherishing ourselves and cherishing
others, from a point of view of help and happiness. To put it quite briefly, the
total amount of happiness that exists in the world has come from wanting to make
others happy, and from working for the benefit of others. And the total amount
of suffering that exists in the world has, on the other hand, come from cherishing
ourselves, from wanting to make ourselves happy. We must therefore make great
efforts to stop in ourselves this tendency of cherishing ourselves.

Here is the second point from above, which is a brief summary. So what need
is there for many words, for any long explanation? The children of the world work
for their own sake, for their own dear selves; and this makes every single thing
that they ever hoped would not happen to happen to them. The able Buddhas,
on the other hand, do their labor for the sake of others, and in so doing bring to
its final perfection every good and excellent thing. Come and see the difference
between these two, and come to believe in it.

The following contemplations are based on the Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way
of Life (Bodhisattvacharyavatara; Byang-chub-sems-dpa'i spyod-pa la 'jug-pa) of the
Buddhist master Shantideva (circa 700 AD), and the commentary upon it by
Gyaltsab Je Darma Rinchen (1364-1432) entitled Entry Point for Children of the
Victorious Buddhas (rGyal-sras 'jug-ngogs). The relevant sections are found at
folios 28B-30B and 106A-114A, respectively, in the ACIP electronic editions
TD3871 and S5436.
The content of the contemplations is translated directly from the root text and
commentary; the names of the contemplations are not a part of the original
text, but are based on the divisions of Gyaltsab Je's commentary and have been
supplied for reference. Each lesson is accompanied by the full detailed outline

Here is the first point, on the problems of cherishing ourselves that we cannot
see. We must learn to practice perfectly this exchange of our own happiness with
the suffering of others. That is, in the past, we focused upon achieving happiness
for ourselves, and upon eliminating our own suffering. Now though we must
do the opposite, which is to cherish others. If we fail to focus on bringing
about their happiness, and upon striving to eliminate their suffering, then we
ourselves will never reach that enlightenment. And even if you think to yourself
that it would be all right to stay here in the cycle of life without reaching
enlightenment, still it is a fact that there is in this cycle no kind of happiness
which is complete.

Here is the second point, on the problems of cherishing ourselves that we can
see. Suppose you fail to discard this tendency to cherish yourself, and to
practice the exchange of yourself and others. You can forget then the problems
this causes in reaching the goals of the world beyond; even in this life none of the
things that you hope to achieve will ever come about: those whose duty it is to serve
you will do none of their work, and those masters you serve will never pay you for
work that you have done.

Consider every single harm that comes in this entire world, whether it be from
humans or from non-human creatures. Think too of every fear that comes in the
mind, and so too every pain that ever comes in the body. All of them come from
grasping to, from cherishing, myself. What use for me then is this single greatest
demon, this cherishing of myself that causes everything there is that I don't
want to happen? I should stamp it out.
Until the day that you give up this habit of cherishing your own self only, you'll
not be able to stop the suffering of all living kind; it's like, for example, the
following example: until the day that you let go of some coal of fire that you're
holding in your hand, you will not be able to stop your hand from burning.

Here is the second point, which is trying to avoid acting in a wrong way, once
we have done the exchange of ourselves with others. I have dedicated my life
to be a servant of other beings, and it's wrong for me act in ways that are
improper towards those whose servant I am; for example, in the way I look at
them or anything of the like. It's something very wrong for me to look with eyes
of anger at other beings, or something like this, when these eyes themselves
belong to the other beings. And it's also wrong for me to work only, exclusively,
for my own goals. I must try to work for them, for their goals; and since it since
it's so wrong to do something towards them that's not right, looking with the eyes
that belong to them to hurt them or such, I must watch myself to see if I am
doing anything wrong to them through any of the three doors of expression.
I must understand it when I am making a mistake, and I should develop a
habit of restraining myself from such actions, through thinking over and over
about the problems they will bring me.

Next is the third point, which is acting in a way which is not mistaken, once
we have done the exchange. Therefore--that is, given the above reasoning--I
should make all other people the first priority. Anything that I ever find upon my
person--food, clothing, or anything of the like--I should take away from me
forcefully; that is, I should remove my tendency to see it as being "mine," and
seek some way to make a use of it for these other people. I should never forget to
think of my food and clothing as though they belonged to some great master,
and that I am simply using them.

Here you, the bodhisattva, should focus upon those living beings who are
inferior to you, those who are equal, those who are superior, and so on. Then
you should make them be yourself, and you should make yourself now be none
other than these others; that is, you should reverse the states of mind which hold
to "me" and "other." When you engage in this practice of exchanging yourself
and others then you should do so with a state of mind which is resolved, which
is free of any idea such as hesitation about what you're doing. If you are the
bodhisattva named "John" then you should practice feeling jealous of John; or
if you're equal to him you should practice feeling competitive towards him; or
if he's inferior to you, you should practice feeling proud towards him.

When the bodhisattva named "John" engages in the practice of exchanging
himself and others, he should think to himself, "This one, John, should receive
the honor of others." Then he should think of other living beings as himself and
say, "But since we are inferior in the good qualities that we possess, it should
not be us who gets the honor." We should furthermore never get the things that
make us happy in that way that he, this John, always does. He, the bodhisattva
John, should bask in praise, and we, all of us sentient beings, should be belittled.

He should have all happiness, and we should have the suffering. We should be
the ones who have to do all of the work--such as carrying heavy loads and the
like--and he, John, should sit around in perfect leisure. Throughout the world he,
this bodhisattva, should become known as a man who is great in his morality, his

learning, and all the rest, whereas we should stay inferior, and known as knowing
nothing.

Now you have taken great pains to gain good qualities; what's the use of this

The fact that he is so superior, and we so inferior, is all established by
comparison. Remember then that there do exist those people of exceeding good
qualities compared to whom this bodhisattva is himself inferior. There are also
those miserable beings compared to whom we are the highest. Therefore there is
no need for us, for us living beings, to feel discouraged; with effort, we can
achieve enlightenment. Do the practice this way, thinking of others as being
yourself.

Suppose someone comes and says, "You are inferior to this bodhisattva John,
due to the fact that your morality and your worldviews are degenerate, and
the like." But the degenerate state of our morality and worldviews, and the fact
that we have troubles making a living and all the rest--all this degeneration of
both the way we think and the way we act--is forced upon us by temporary
factors, by mental affliction. The problem here is not that we have chosen to be
this way, not that we want to be this way. The relevant part of the root text
here can also be read as "are rather forced by the temporary factor of
affliction."

If you really have any compassion, you bodhisattva John, then you must care
for us, and try to remove our troubles, by using all your strength. And we too
should willingly take on all the hurts that come from the spiritual hardships
needed to gain fine qualities. Let us though ask a question: are we not someone
you, John, should care for and try to help? Why is it then that you belittle us
living beings so? And what use anyway would we ever have for the qualities that
he, this bodhisattva, has? Because he is indeed an extraordinary being, of great
qualities--qualities that are doing absolutely no good for all us living beings.

Moreover, this bodhisattva John has degenerated in his morality and his
worldview, and so it is as though he is living in the jaws of some savage thing
like the lower births, or a poisonous snake, or some great wild beast. Because
of this fact he has no compassion for living beings; he is not only of no help to all
us beings, he is even worse than no help. He has a delusion that he possesses
higher spiritual qualities, and so it is almost seems as though he hopes to pollute
the "wise," meaning us sentient beings; it is not right, the way that he either

desires us to excess, or else derides us. And so it is that we must think
carefully about how wrong it is for the bodhisattva to hurt himself, once he has
decided to think of all living beings as himself, and himself as them.

Here is the second point, which is competing with each other in a whole list
of good things. No matter what now we must see to it that all the good qualities
which we have are spoken of highly and publicized, all over the world. We must
moreover assure that what good qualities he, this bodhisattva, may happen to have

Next is the third point, on learning to take joy when trouble comes to the other
one. Any faults that we, all sentient beings, may have must be hidden away; and
we--again all living beings--must make efforts to see that offerings are made to
us by other beings, but not to him. We must gain with ease, and now, all the things
we ever wanted--food, clothes, and the like--and we must win all the honor that
others could give; but these should not come to him.

Here is the fourth point, learning to take joy when trouble comes to the other
one. Whenever something wrong befalls him, whenever this bodhisattva John
suffers a loss, all of us will watch for a long length of time, feeling a kind of joy.
We will also assure that he becomes a laughing-stock for everyone, for all beings,
and that he is derided in all circles, and responds in the same way. Say to
yourself these things, exchange yourself with others, and so raise the spirits of
living beings, and stop any delusions you may have about having great
spiritual qualities yourself.

exchanging yourself and others, then it's completely impossible that you'd be living
like this, going through all this suffering, in something so opposite to the bliss of
Buddhahood--the perfect and excellent completion of one's own and all others'
goals. As such you should feel a deep sense of regret for all the time you have
wasted in meaningless activities, and strive now with great energy to practice

You might think to yourself the following: "I could try to practice exchanging
myself and others, but I don't think I could ever become accustomed to it
completely." As such--meaning that, since there are so many benefits which
come from working for others--you must become accustomed to thinking of others,
and you must bring this practice of thinking of others to its final end. When
you think of others you must learn to cherish all these living beings just as you
do yourself, when you get used to believing that your body, which has come from
nothing more than a couple of drops of semen and blood belonging to someone
else--that is, to your parents--could ever be this person you call yourself.

acting as if I were the least of servants, accepting every extra load, without any
kind of pride as I do so. Let me reflect upon how he, meaning me, is by his

very nature wrong. And if it occurs to me that I should praise him for some
minute good quality that he might have, something like a little learning, then
let me think the following. I will refuse to praise him for some small and
insignificant good qualities he may acquire by accident; I will see to it that any
qualities which he, this bodhisattva, does have are not detected by anyone else at all.
And thus it is that we must be sure to keep our good qualities secret, and
contemplate upon the practice of never publicizing them at all.

Suppose someone makes the following argument: "I spend my time taking care
of my body out of a special kind of craving: out of a desire to work for the
good of others." But this way of thinking is wrong, because the more it is that
you feel craving for this body of yours, and cherish it--the more it is that you
take steps to do what you must in order to care for this, for the body of yours, with
food and clothing and the rest--then the more it is that you get great pain
when you fail to get even some small thing that you want; the more it is that the
body descends to nothing more than a state in which it cannot bear any pain at all,
cannot endure even small sufferings. When the body has fallen in this way,
it becomes extremely difficult to care for.

"And what happens then?" you may ask. The fall is such that the craving
increases further and further, until it reaches a point where, even if you were able
to get every thing that was desirable on the surface of this planet, it would still never
be enough to quench your feelings of desire. Who then is it that could act to give
you all you want, who could satisfy your craving? So long as you have a
craving for the objects of the senses, it is completely impossible for you to be
contented.

It is, for example, like the statement in scripture about the king named Nurse-
from-Me, who had at his disposal the entire wealth of the four continents, and
half of the throne of the great god Hundred Gifts himself. Yet still he could
not be satisfied. And when the desires we have cannot be satisfied, then an
intense craving for the objects of desire occurs, which brings on mental afflictions
such as liking things, or disliking things, and all the rest. It also causes a
lessening of what thoughts we do have which are tending towards the virtuous

Satisfaction, the ultimate pleasure

The excellent things that come to those
Who depend on nothing at all
Are absolutely endless;
On the other hand is desire for
The body, which grows forever,
Leaving you no other chance.
He who is finished grasping to
Attractions has found the finest
Thing to possess of all.

Think about those who depend upon nothing at all: who care nothing for their
body, or for possessions. The excellent things that come to them, their perfect
qualities of feeling little need for things, and being easily satisfied, are absolutely
endless. As such it is completely impossible for them to go through the frenetic
way of life caused by not having enough material things.

On the other hand is the desire where you crave material possessions for the sake
of the body; if you fail to apply the antidotes for this attitude, then it grows
forever--so that the craving for objects of the senses leaves you with no other
chance in your life. He who is finished grasping to things which are attractions,
he who has stopped holding them to be attractive, has found the finest thing to
possess of all.

Its final destination is always the same:
The dust. On its own it is immobile,
Dependent upon another for its motion.
This body is a thing of filth,
And merciless too; why then do you
Hold it to be yourself?

I cannot stop my pride for it?

The final destination for it--for this body--is always the same: the dust, and never
anywhere else. On its own the body is immobile, and depends upon another, the
mind, for getting it to move. This body is a thing of filth, a huge pile of filthy
things like meat and blood, and the source of a great many merciless fears too.
Why then do you hold it to be yourself? If you do hold it this way, then you will
have to undergo the sufferings of the hells. And so whether it lives or dies, it
doesn't matter to me; what's the use of this machinery, the body? There's no point
to it at all. And what difference is there at all between it, this body, and a lump
of rock that sits there motionless? Think about how terrible it is; how
unbearable our craving for the body is. Think about how sad it is; why is it
that I cannot stop the pride I feel, the arrogance, that I have for the body? I must
act now, to wipe out every form of pride within me.

Regardless of whether I continue to care
For the body, or whether the vultures
Come to feed upon it,
It has no feelings of attachment
Or anger; why then is it that
I have this attachment myself?

In your worship of this body, my mind, you've gone and piled up many sufferings,
all of it meaninglessly. This body makes me feel love towards those who help
me, and hate towards those who do me harm. Even if I do work hard to take
care of it though, the body has no capacity of returning the kindness; it just sits
there, no better than a piece of wood. So what's the use of this thing, why am I so
attached to it? It's wrong for me to act like this.

Regardless of whether I continue to care for the body with different material
possessions, or whether the vultures and so on come to feed upon it, this body has
no feelings of attachment towards those who help it, nor any anger for those that
hurt it. Why then is it that I have this attachment for it myself? What I do is
very wrong.

Contemplation Forty-Three
The goals of quietude

,DE BAS SGRIB PA BSAL BA'I PHYIR,

And so, in order to clear away
The obstacles, I must collect my mind
To avoid the path that errs;
Always then I must place my thoughts
In balanced meditation upon
An object that's correct.

And so it is, that in order to clear away all the obstacles--both those that relate to
the mental afflictions and those that block a knowledge of all things--I must
learn to develop the special vision of reality. To do this, I must first learn to
develop meditative quietude. And for this, I must collect my mind, to avoid the
path that errs; that is, to avoid the useless thoughts of desire and so on which
act to prevent me from reaching quietude. I must then use the eight factors of
eliminating the problems to meditation, in order to place my thoughts always in
balanced meditation upon an object that's correct.
[The eight factors are:
1) an interest in learning to meditate;
2) effort which delights in meditating;
3) a kind of faith which believes in the benefits of meditation;
4) a pleasant feeling of self-control of body and mind in meditation;
5) recollection, which helps one to avoid losing the object being
meditated upon;
6) awareness, which watches to see if either mental restlessness or
dullness are occurring;
7) the thought to take action, which applies meditational antidotes in
the mind when necessary; and
8) the thought to leave things alone, when restlessness and dullness
have been shut off, and the mind is focused correctly.]
To summarize, we must undertake to learn in greater detail the shared method
of achieving meditative quietude as it is found in the Levels of Listeners, as well
as the unique method of achieving this quietude as it is found in the present
root text, and in the Stages of Meditation, written by Master Kamalashila. We
must consider carefully the great benefits that are derived from the practice of
meditative quietude, and the serious problems caused by not meditating in this
way. And then we must strive to make intense efforts in meditating upon
single-pointed concentration, using the nine methods of fixing the mind, and
so on. For greater detail, we must also study the presentations found in the
greater and lesser books on the stages of the path of the perfections.

Here in summary is a final verse:
We must learn to use the special vision,
Which sees directly the nature of reality,
In order to destroy the two types of obstacles,
Ripping them out from the roots.
All this though depends on achieving
Unshakable one-pointed concentration;
As such you must first seek to master
The practice of quietude.
