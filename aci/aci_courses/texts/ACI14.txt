Course XIV: Lojong, Developing the Good Heart
Reading Three

SHOG*, , RGYAL BA YANG DGON PA'I GDAMS NGAG BZHUGS SO, ,
Herein Contained are the Advices of the Victorious One,
Yang Gunpa
The following advices are included in A Compendium of Texts on Developing the
Good Heart (Blo-sbyong brgya-rtza), compiled by the great bodhisattva Muchen
Konchok Gyeltsen (14th century), pp. 335-337. They were composed by Gyalwa Yang
Gunpa (1213-1258), an illustrious master of the Kagyu tradition. The verses are old,
and the copy that we have to work with seems to have a number of textual errors,
which we have tried to work around but have largely left uncorrected.
The Victorious One, Yang Gunpa, once said:

*, , 'DUS BYAS LA RTAG PA MED KYI,
,ZHEN MED KYI 'KHRI BA CHAD,
,'KHOR BA NA BDE BA MED KYIS,
,NGES 'BYUNG GI SKYO SHAS BSKYED,
Nothing that starts remains unchanged;
Have no attachment, cut the ties.
There's no happiness in this vicious circle;
Get tired of it, find renunciation.

,'JIG RTEN LA SNYING PO MED KYI,
,RDZUN LA BLO GTAD MA BYED,
,RANG SEMS SANGS RGYAS YIN GYI,
,NGO SHES KYI ZHAL MJAL GYIS GSUNGS,
The world is hollow and meaningless;
Do not trust the lie.
Your own mind is the Buddha;
Go and meet your friend.

,YANG ,
He also said:

,TSE 'DI'I GRIB SO YOL LA,
,THAR LAM RDOG SNA BSKUL 
CIG,'DU 'DZI'I BLO SNA RINGS SO,
,'PHYI PHYIS BLO SNA BTUNGS 
The hour of life is passing;
Start down the road to freedom.
Send away the many thoughts of the busy life you lead;
Bring to your side the many thoughts of what will happen later.

SHIG,SPRO YANG SDOD DBANG MED DO,
,PHYI MAR GANG PHAN SOM 
CIG,DAL 'BYOR RGYUN THOB DKA' 'O,
,THOB TSE SNYING PO LONG 
Everyone would like to stay, but no one has the power;
Try to think of something that will come and help you later.
It's hard to find a life with opportunity and leisure;
Now for once you have, so try to get the most from it.

CIG,'KHRUL PA 'DRIS PA SLA'O,
,DRAN PA'I SO PA TSUGS 
SHIG,'DOD YON 'DRED PA MKHAS SO,

It's easy to get used to mistakes;

Learn to hate useless things.

CIG,CHOS MIN SNYING PO MED DO,
,JI DGU THED LA BOR

,MYUR BA'I SKAM SHA ZO CIGCES SO, ,
Nothing but the Dharma means anything at all;
Throw the rest out like trash.
It all boils down to dying;
Pack light and take off now.

,YANG ,
He also said:

,'CHI BA SNYING LA BZHOG DANG ,
,BRTZON 'GRUS LA THANG LHOD MED PA'I GNAD YIN,
Put your death in your heart;
This is the key for checking
Whether your practice is tuned too tight or loose.

,'KHOR BA'I SKYON TSANG SOMS DANG ,
,ZHEN PA RTING NAS BZLOG PA'I GNAD YIN,
Think of the viper's nest of the problems of this life;
This is the key for stopping

,BLO SNA GZHAN DON DU SBYONGS DANG ,

Let every thought be of what others need;
This is the key for making
Everything you ever do the Dharma.

,BSAM RGYU BLA MA LA GYIS DANG ,

Don't think of anything but your Lama;
This is the key for turning
Your mind and Theirs into one.

,SNOD BCUD YI DAM DU SBYONGS DANG ,
,THA MAL GYI ZHEN PA BZLOG PA'I GNAD YIN,
See the world and people as Angels;
This is the key for stopping
The idea that life is ordinary.

,GANG SHAR SO MAR BZHOG DANG ,
,'KHOR BA RANG GROL LA 'GRO BA'I GNAD YIN,
Whatever comes, make it crystal;
This is the key for making
This life turn to freedom, all by itself.

,GNAD DRUG GI GDAMS PA'O, ,
This last teaching is known as the "Advices on the Six Keys."

,RGYAL PO BZHI NI,
The next one is called "The Four Kings."

,MOS GUS KYI RGYAL PO BLA MA SANGS RGYAS SU MTHONG BA,

The King of Faith is thinking about your death.
The King of Practice is giving up on this world.
The King of Devotion is to see your Lama as the Buddha.
The King of Thoughts is to cut off your dependence
on seeing things as coming from their own side.

,GSUNG YANG ,
He also said:

,BDE BA THAMS CAD LDAN PAR 'DOD NA,
,'DOD CHAGS LA GNYEN PO THONGS DGOS,
If you want to have every happiness,
You must use the antidotes that keep you
From liking things ignorantly.

,BLA NA MED PA'I BYANG CHUB THOB PAR 'DOD NA,

If you want to reach matchless Enlightenment,
You must use the antidotes that keep you
From being ignorant.

,MGO THON PAR 'DOD NA,
,NGA RGYAL LA GNYEN PO THONGS DGOS,
If you want to stand independent on your own,
You must use the antidotes that keep you
From feeling any pride.

,GEGS THAMS CAD SEL BAR 'DOD NA,
,PHRAG DOG LA GNYEN PO THONGS DGOS,
If you want to stop all obstacles,
You must use the antidotes that keep you
From feeling jealousy.

,'DI LTAR ZAB CHOS KYI GNAD MA 'DUS PA MED PAS, GSOL BA THOB, GZHIG PA CHUG GSUNGS,
There is not a single important point in all of the teachings of the Dharma
which is not found in these words. Go then and pray for blessings; go then
and think hard about these things.

,YANG ,
He also said,

,DAD PA LA MI RTAG PA'I SO BA TSUGS,
,DGE SBYOR LA BRTZON 'GRUS KYI LCAGS KYIS BRAB,
Post the sentry of thinking about impermanence, and let him guard
your faith.
Beat the horse of your spiritual practice with the whip of joyful effort.

,DAM TSIG LA RANG SEMS KYI DPANG PO 
ZHOG,DGRA DUG LNGA LA KHA NANG DU LDOG GIN STOS,
Let your own mind be the witness who testifies whether you've kept
your pledges.
If you need an enemy to fight, then stop the five poisons that live
inside of you.
The "five poisons" are the mental afflictions of liking things ignorantly, disliking
things ignorantly, being ignorant, pride, and jealousy; these have appeared in the
verses just above.

,YANG ,
He also said:

,LHA CHOS KYI RTZA BA DAD PA,
,JO BZANGS KYI RTZA BA ZHEN 
LOG,'GRO DON GYI RTZA BA SNYING RJE,
,BYIN RLABS KYI RTZA BA MOS GUS,
,SANGS RGYAS KYI RTZA BA RTOGS TSAD GSUNGS,
Faith is the very root of all the Dharma of the Gods.
Feeling sick of this life is the very root of all fine people.
Compassion is the very root of working to help others.
Devotion is the very root of receiving every blessing.
Whatever realizations you have are the very root of the Buddhas.

,RTZA BA LNGA'O,
These are known as the "Five Roots."

,BSGYUR BA LNGA NI,
He also taught something called the "Five Changes":

,RTAG SEMS 'CHI BAR BSGYUR BA,
,CHAGS SEMS SGYU MAR BSGYUR BA,
,SDANG SEMS SNYING RJER BSGYUR BA,
,SPYOD LAM CHOS SPYOD DU BSGYUR BA,
,RNAM RTOG LTA BAR BSGYUR BA'O GSUNGS,
Change your idea that nothing will change into thoughts of death.
Change your desire for things into the realization that everything is
an illusion.
Change your anger into compassion.
Change the way you live now into a life of Dharma.
Change all the ideas you have into worldview.

,YANG ,
And he also said:

,'DAS PA'I RJES SPYOD PA 'GYOD,
,ZHEN GYI PHYI RNYOGS YIN GYI 
The legacy of the past
Is a life you can well regret;
Dregs from your old attachments,
Leave that all behind now.

BZHOG,MA 'ONGS PA'I SNGUN BSU BA,

Leave that all behind now.

ZHOG,DA LTA BA LA BZO BYED PA,

Anger and attachment;
Leave that all behind now.

,CHOS SKU'I NGO SPROD YIN GYIS SKYONG GSUNGS,
Decide that all you see here is
The Realm of the Uncreated,
A taste of the Voidness Body;
Keep this with you now.

,YANG ,
And finally did the Victorious One, Yang Gunpa, speak the following:

,NA TSA 'DI YANG DAG TU GRUB PA MED KYI 'DZIN PHUR THON,
,KUN RDZOB TU LAS 'BRAS MI BSLU BA YIN GYI LAS NGAN SDIG SGRIB SBYONG ,

,CHOS BDUN PO DE SEMS LA 
ZHOG,NYAMS LEN NANG THOG TU SBYONGS GSUNGS SO, ,
Keep these seven Dharma teachings in your heart, and let your
Dharma practice be something that you do inside yourself:
1) This sickness didn't just happen by itself; so use the medicine and
get rid of it.
2) On the level of appearances, karma and its consequences never fail;
so clean away your bad karma, your bad deeds and your
obstacles.
3) The reality of things is beyond the mind; so reside in a state where
you hold to nothing. [This statement should not be taken
literally, but rather interpreted in light of the teachings of the
Middle Way.]
4) Grasping to things as self-existent is what forces you to take birth;
so cut the ties of all your hopes and dreams.
5) Your inner nature is the Body of Voidness; so recognize how sick
you are.
6) Whatever happens is a holy blessing; so think of everything that
happens as an attainment.
7) Think whatever you want; but don't think of anything as pain.

Course XIV: Lojong, Developing the Good Heart
Readings Four and Five

`THEG PA CHEN PO'I GDAMS NGAG 
BLO SBYONG DON BDUN MA'I RTZA BA BZHUGS SO,
Herein Lies the Root Text of
"The Seven-Step Practice for Developing a Good Heart,"
Advices for Training Oneself in the Greater Way
The following version of the Seven-Step Practice for Developing a Good Heart was
excerpted from a "short woodblock" (dpe-thung) format edition, including the text of
Lord Atisha's Lamp for the Path, in the possession of Sermey Khen Rinpoche Geshe
Lobsang Tharchin. The text is quite old and had a number of apparent problems; the
following version has been compiled using several other editions for comparison.

,AOm SVA STI,
Om svasti!
Om! May there be goodness!

THEG PA CHEN PO'I GDAMS NGAG BLO SBYONG GI SKOR LA, , 'KHRID TSUL MI 'DRA BA DU MA YOD KYANG , DGE BA'I BSHES GNYEN 'CHAD KHA BA'I LUGS KYIS DON BDUN DU MDZAD DE, SNGON 'GRO RTEN GYI CHOS BSTAN PA, DNGOS GZHI BYANG CHUB KYI SEMS SBYONG BA, RKYEN NGAN BYANG CHUB KYI LAM DU KHYER BA, , TSE GCIG GI NYAMS LEN DRIL NAS BSTAN PA, , BLO 'BYONGS PA'I TSAD, , BLO SBYONG GI DAM TSIG, BLO SBYONG GI BSLAB BYA DANG BDUN GYI,
Now there are a great many ways of teaching those advices for training oneself
in the greater way--the lojong, or instructions for developing the good heart.
In the tradition of the spiritual friend, the geshe, Chekawa, these instructions
are organized into a seven-part practice. These seven are:
1) Instructions on the foundation Dharma, the preliminary practices;
2) The actual practice for developing the Wish for
Enlightenment [bodhichitta];
3) Learning to use problems as a path to Enlightenment;
4) A summary of an entire lifetime's practice;
5) The point at which one can say that he or she has
successfully developed the good heart;
6) Pledges to keep for developing the good heart; and
7) Certain advices on developing the good heart.

Part One:
Instructions on the Foundation Dharma,
The Preliminary Practices
The first of these is expressed in the following line of the root text:
Train yourself first in the preliminaries.
These preliminaries come in three parts: meditating on your spiritual
opportunities and fortunes, and considering how difficult it is to obtain them;
meditating upon your own death, the fact that you are impermanent; and
meditating upon the problems of this vicious circle of suffering.

Part Two:
The Actual Practice for Developing
The Wish for Enlightenment (Bodhichitta)
The second part, on the actual practice for developing the Wish for
Enlightenment, has two steps of its own: developing the ultimate Wish, and
developing the apparent Wish. There are three sections within the first of
these steps: the preparation, the actual practice, and the conclusion. For the
preparation, you should do the following: bring to mind thoughts of taking
refuge; make supplications; offer the various steps of the seven-part practice;
take your meditation position with your body carefully straightened up; and
then count your breaths up to 21, without losing track at all.

The second step, the actual practice, is found in the following lines of the root
text:
Learn to see all things as a dream;
Examine the nature of the mind, unborn.
The antidote itself is gone to is;
Let it go in the essence, source of all things.

GSUM PA NI, THUN MTSAMS SGYU MA'I SKYES BUR BYA,
The third step, the conclusion, is expressed in the next line of the root text:
Inbetween sessions, be a figment of the imagination.

The second more general step, meditating on the apparent Wish for
Enlightenment, has two sections: deep meditation, and the period after this.
Here is the first:
Practice giving and taking, alternately;
Let the two ride on the wind.

GNYIS PA NI, , YUL GSUM DUG GSUM DGE RTZA GSUM, , SPYOD LAM KUN TU TSIG GIS SBYANG , , LEN PA'I GO RIM RANG NAS BRTZAM,
And here is the second:
Three objects, three poisons, three stores of virtue.

Part Three:
Learning to Use Problems
as a Path to Enlightenment
The third main part, learning to use problems as a path to Enlightenment, is
found in the following lines of the root text:
When the world and those in it are full of bad deeds,
Learn to use problems as a path to Enlightenment.

Here there are two different steps: how to think, and how to act. The first has
two sections of its own: the apparent and the ultimate. Here is the first:

The blame all belongs to only one person.
Practice seeing them all full of kindness.

Next is the step on how to practice in your actions:
The four acts are the supreme method.
On the spot, turn all that happens to practice.
Note by the Tibetan commentator: These four are accumulating masses of good
karma; cleaning oneself of bad karma; making offerings to harmful spirits; and
making offerings to protectors of the Dharma.

A Summary of an Entire Lifetime's Practice
The brief essentials of the instruction
Are combined within five powers.
In the great way these same five are the advices
For sending your mind; cherish the act.

Note by the Tibetan commentator: The five powers are those of resolutions for the
future; of accustoming yourself; of pure white seeds; of destruction; and of
prayer.

The Point at Which One Can Say
That He or She has Successfully Developed the Good Heart
All Dharma comes down to a single point.
There are two judges; keep the main one.
Be joy alone, in an unbroken stream.
It's there when you can keep it unthinking.
Note by the Tibetan commentator: The two judges here are yourself and others.

Part Six:
Pledges to Keep for Developing the Good Heart
Keep to the three laws.
Change your mind and stay the same.
Speak not of what was broken.
Never worry about what they're doing.
Rid yourself of the biggest affliction first.
Never hope for any reward.
Stop eating poison food.
Don't let the stream flow smooth.
Forget repaying criticism.
Give up laying ambushes.
No going for the jugular.
Load your own truck, no passing the buck.
Don't get fixed on speed.
Don't feed the wrong face.
Don't turn the sweet angel to a devil.
Don't look for crap to make yourself happy.
Note by the Tibetan commentator: The three laws are never acting in a way that
contradicts what you have committed yourself to; never placing yourself in a
dangerous situation; and never falling into the habit of discriminating between
others.

Do two at the two of beginning and end.
Bear with whichever comes of the two.
Keep the two at the cost of your life.
Note by the Tibetan commentator: The "two" in the second line are being well off
and being poor. The "two" in the third line are your general spiritual pledges
and the pledges of the instructions on developing the good heart.

Train yourself in the three kinds of hardship.
Take to yourself the three main causes.
Live in three ways that never get weaker.
Keep the three that should never be lost.
Note by the Tibetan commentator: The "three hardships" are learning to detect the
start of a mental affliction; to stop it; and to stop the habit. The "three main
causes" are finding a Lama, practicing the Dharma, and having all the support
you need to practice the Dharma come together. The "three ways" are feeling
devotion [for your Lama], joy [for practicing the lojong or instructions for
developing a good heart], and keeping your various vows and commitments
[through strong awareness and recollection]. The "three that should never be
lost" are virtuous actions in your actions, your words, and your thoughts.

Figure out both and free yourself.
Stop thinking all the time about how wonderful you are.
Don't let little things get to you.
Don't change from moment to moment.
Don't expect any thanks.
Note by the Tibetan commentator: When you have trained yourself well in these,
then you will be able to do the following:

Turn these five signs of the days of darkness
Around us into a path to enlightenment.
These words of advice are the essence of nectar;
They were passed down through Serlingpa.
Note by the Tibetan commentator: The five signs are transformed into learning to
endure without anger; feeling inspired to practice; a feeling of sweetness;
thoughts of compassion; and great aspiration--and so the mind itself becomes

the path. [The five signs of the days of darkness, which are said to be going
on now, are: the darkness of the times, marked by strife; the darkness of
lifespans, which have dropped to less than a hundred; the darkness of
worldviews, very mistaken and difficult to change in people; the darkness of
mental afflictions, strong and protracted; and the darkness of beings
themselves, with minds and senses that are out of control.] The last two lines
are meant to indicate that this instruction is one with an authoritative source.

Karmic seeds from following this practice in my past lives
Were awakened, and the urge to teach this to others came to me
On many occasions. And so I have finished it, these words
Of instruction for beating the tendency of seeing things
As having some nature of their own, and I have ignored
All kinds of trouble and the derision of others to do so.
Now I can die,
Without a shred of regret.
Note by the Tibetan commentator: In these words, that king of all deep
practitioners, Chekawa, expresses the greatness of the instruction, for he has
succeeded in applying it to his own heart.
Incidentally, there are many different versions of this root text: some are longer
or shorter, and in others the lines come in a different order. I've set this one
down here following the version found in the book of instruction by the
bodhisattva Tokme.

When the holy Lama, the Great One, the Sachen, was twelve years of age, he
spent six months in a deep practice to reach the Realized One, Manjushri.

One day he had a direct vision of the Lord, Manjushri. His body was a russet
gold, and he sat atop a throne of jewels, in the midst of a great mass of pure
light. He held his hands in the gesture of teaching the Dharma, and sat with
a look of perfect beauty, flanked by a pair of bodhisattvas. And then he spoke
the following words:

,TSE 'DI LA ZHEN NA CHOS PA MIN,
,KHAMS GSUM LA ZHEN NA NGES 'BYUNG MIN,
,BDAG DON LA ZHEN NA BYANG SEMS MIN,
,'DZIN PA BYUNG NA LTA BA MIN,
A person who is still attached to this life is no Dharma practitioner.
A person who is still attached to the three worlds has no renunciation.
A person who is still attached to getting what they want is no bodhisattva.
A person who still grasps to things has no worldview.

And the Sachen thought carefully about the meaning of these words. And he
came to realize that the entire practice of the path of the perfections could all
be found here, in these words for developing the good heart, called "Freedom
from the Four Attachments." And thus did he come to an extraordinary level
of understanding all the things there are.

Here is the first. Give up attachment to this life.
Anyone who keeps the ethical life,

There's no way you can do without
Living the ethical life. But if you do so
Because you're attached to goals of this life,
Then you've planted the roots for living in
The eight worldly thoughts.
You'll disparage those whose ethics are less.
You'll feel jealous of those who keep
Their ethics well. The ethics you follow yourself
Will be done for the recognition of others.
You will plant the seeds for the lower realms.
You will slip into being a person
Whose ethical life is a sham.

A person who follows the arts of learning
And contemplation gains resources
That will allow them to reach all knowable things.
People like this in the world are a lamp

And possess the seeds that will bring them

There's no way you can do without
Learning and contemplation. But a person
Whose learning and contemplation are done
Attached to worldly kinds of goals
Is only gaining the resources which
Will allow them to reach the state of pride.
They will speak badly of those whose learning
And contemplation are less than theirs.
They will be jealous of others
Whose learning and contemplation are good.
The people around them, and all they own,
Will never be very stable.
They are planting roots to grow
As a birth in the lower realms.
They have slipped into learning and contemplation
That is lost to the eight worldly thoughts.

There's no way you can do without
Learning to meditate. But a person
Whose meditation is focused upon
Achieving worldly kinds of goals
Is a person who in the midst of the forest
Is living in a downtown crowd.
The prayers that they recite
Are worthless blabber.
They put down those who study and contemplate.
They feel jealous of others who meditate.
Their meditative concentration
Has slipped into one-pointedness of mind
Upon these same eight worldly thoughts.

You would never be able to bear it.
He who fails in accomplishing

If you hold that things then can't exist,
You will never find a higher birth;

Now you can always count on them,
They always repay the kindness received.
They lend a hand to all who come,
And are soft and gentle to everyone.
They are courteous in their behavior to others,
And act as a servant to all.
They listen well what needs to be done,
And greet you with a joyful smile.

They use with respect resources we share,
And their courage is always evident.
Their places are clean and simple,
They are getting their paradise ready,
And the Dharma has captured their hearts.
People like this are truly kings
Of the great soaring lords, the garudas;
They will pass with speed to the heaven
Where the Youthful Guide holds court.

***************
In his explanation of Freedom from Four Attachments, the holy lama Drakpa Gyeltsen
describes the suffering of the three lower realms, and says we should "pity the man or
woman who ends up in those realms." The following quotation, from Lord Buddha
himself, is used by Je Tsongkapa and other eminent Lamas to explain just where these
realms really exist:

,SEMS CAN STONG PHRAG DU MA SKYO BSKYED KYANG ,
,GANG DAG SHI 'PHOS NGAN 'GROR DRAG 'GRO BA'I,
,'GRO BA DE DAG NAM YANG YOD MA YIN,
Lord Buddha spoke the following, in the Sutra Requested by Upali:
When I taught you of the terrors
Of the realms of hell,
Many thousands of those among you
Were frightened and dismayed.
But I tell you now,
That those people who die and travel
To these terrible realms of pain
Don't even exist at all.

,GNOD PA BYED PA YOD PA MA YIN TE,
,RTOG PA'I DBANG GIS NGAN SONG DE DAG NA,
,LUS LA 'BAB MTHONG DE NA MTSON CHA MED,
There is no one to hurt you,
No one to cut you with a sword,
No one to thrust a spear through your body;
Everything that you see happening to you
Within these realms of terror
Is only a projection;
There are no instruments of pain there.

Flowers blossom in a rainbow
Of pleasing, elegant blooms;
Mighty structures crafted of pure gold
Steal your heart away.
But here too no one ever came
And stopped to do construction;
All of these were also built
By the single act of projection--
The whole world is but a creation
That comes from your projections.

Reading Eight

*, , THEG PA CHEN PO'I BLO SBYONG MTSON CHA 'KHOR LO BZHUGS SO, ,
Herein lie the instructions
on developing the good heart entitled
"The Wheel of Knives"
This work on developing the good heart was presented to Lord Atisha (982-1052) by
the Indian master Dharma Rakshita. The selections found here are taken from a
version in the Dharmsala edition of The Compendium of Texts on Developing the
Good Heart, pp. 96-110. Please note that many different editions of the texts exist,
with spellings that sometimes vary greatly; we have used some of these in the present
translation where it appeared more correct.

Peacocks wander in the midst
Of a forest of poison trees;
A garden of healing herbs and plants
May be something lovely,
But peacocks have no love for them--
They live off poison itself.

A garden of comfort and pleasures

But the warriors have no attachment for them--
They live off a forest of pain.

The kings of cowardice who pursue
Comfort and pleasure find themselves
Transported instead to pain.
Those mighty warriors who pursue
Pain for others find themselves
Forever surrounded by bliss,
By the power of their courage.

Now in this place desire is like
A forest of poison trees;
Bodhisattva warriors, like peacocks,
Are strong enough to take it.
Cowards though are like the crow,
For these same leaves are death to it--
How could those who only think
Of what they want themselves
Ever have the strength to eat
This poison?

The same is true with all the other
Mental afflictions there are;
These are enough to threaten the life
Of nirvana for those like crows.
The peacock bodhisattvas though
Turn the poison forest of
Their mental afflictions into opportunities,
And food to keep them strong.
They leap then into the forest
Of this vicious circle of life;
They make it an opportunity,
And thus destroy the poison.

Realize now that grasping for yourself
Is the henchman of the devil
And keeps you here in this vicious circle,
Helpless to help yourself.
Run now far from the state of mind
That only wants what's good for me,
That only wants what feels good,
And happily take upon yourself
Any hardship for others' sake.

Driven on against their will by karma,

Upon the head of the part of me
That wants only me to be happy.

May I stop myself and give away
My own happiness to others.
Whenever those who've pledged to help me
Instead do something very wrong,
May I say to myself, "It's because I failed
To keep my mind on goodness,"
And thus put my heart at ease.

To be more than I am.
From now on then I'll take great care
In choosing those I associate with.

When another person weaves their wiles
And totally misleads me,
It's because the wheel of knives
Has turned on me again:
The karma of thinking only of me,
Of pride, of hoping for recognition.
From now on then I'll not let on
To anyone all the personal qualities
That I've been able to gain.

When all the teaching and learning
Of Dharma that I do
Has degenerated into feelings
Of liking and dislike,
It's because the wheel of knives
Has turned on me again:
The karma of failing to consider

Deep within my thoughts
All the trouble the demons can bring.
From now on then I'll watch
For things that can hurt my practice
And give up all of them.

When all the things that I've done right
Suddenly turn to something wrong,
It's because the wheel of knives
Has turned on me again:
The karma of repaying kindnesses
That others have done for me
With the very opposite.
From now on then I'll bow my head
And with the utmost respect
Return each kindness granted.

To put it in a nutshell,
Anything that ever falls
Upon us that we never wanted
Is just the same as a blacksmith
Who accidentally kills himself
Forging a sword for someone.
It's all because the wheel of knives

Has turned on us again;
Decide then that from now on
You'll be careful not to commit
A single negative act.

When a person goes to the lower realms
And goes through all the pain there,
It's just the same as an archer
Who accidentally kills himself
With an arrow of his own.
It's all because the wheel of knives
Has turned on us again;
So come, decide, that from now on
You'll be careful not to commit
A single negative act.

And when the troubles of the home life
Fall upon you in a flash,
It's just as if a child
Brought up safely by its parents
Turns around and kills them;
It's all because the wheel of knives
Has turned on us again.
From now on then the wisest thing
Is to live the life of a person
Who has left the home life behind.

Reading Nine
The following reading is a continuation of "The Wheel of Knives" as presented to Lord
Atisha (982-1052) by the Indian master Dharma Rakshita.

,'JABS NAS BSLU BA'I CHOM RKUN BDAG GIS ZIN,
,RANG DU BRDZUS NAS BSLU BA'I ZOG PO NI,
,AE MA BDAG 'DZIN 'DI YIN THE TSOM MED,
Since this is the way things are,
I've finally realized
Just who my enemy is.
I've caught the thief who lay in wait
And deceived me with his trap.
He's a masquerader fooling others,
And fooling himself as well.
I see it now!
He's the habit I have
Of grasping to myself,
And of this there can be no doubt.

,DA NI LAS KYI MTSON CHA KLAD LA BSKOR,

,STOBS BZHI'I MCHE BA GTZIGS PA DGRA LA BSNUN,
Now let's see the wheel of knives,
Of karma, cut his skull!
O Angel of Wrath,
Now cut his skull, cut thrice!
Stand like a god on widespread legs,
A knowledge of two truths;
Stare in hatred with two eyes,
Of method, and of wisdom;
Open your jaws and show your fangs,
Four powers of confession,
Sink them deep within the flesh
Of this, my hated foe.

,RANG GZHAN 'PHUNG DU 'JUG PA'I DAM NYAMS KHUG,
I call on the King of the secret knowledge
And secret words that work
To torture all these enemies.
There is no freedom here in the woods
Of the vicious circle of life.
Take up in your hands the wheel of knives,
Take up the wheel of karma,
Speed to the side of my foe,
The cruel one, evil demon that he is,
This grasping to myself,
Broken vows and promises,
Waster of my life and others,
Go and fetch him here.

Fetch him, bring him,
Lord of Anger, Lord of Death;
Strike, strike now,
Strike this highest foe in his heart;
With the roar of hell
Smash now the skull
Of my misperceptions,
The ones who have wasted my life;
Bring your death
To the heart of this butcher,
My greatest enemy.

Force the enemy to swear his allegiance.

Break I beg you all my chains.
Break and smash!
Cut the ties that make me grasp.

Come to me, Angel of Wrath, Lord of Death;
Take this pitiful sack filled with five poisons,
Mired by the force of karma and afflictions
In this filth of the vicious circle of life;
Come, I beg you, come right now,
And rip this bag to shreds.

He would escort me
To the terrors of the three lower realms;
I don't know enough to be afraid of him,
I run to the things that would take me there.
With the roar of hell
Smash now the skull
Of my misperceptions,
The ones who have wasted my life;
Bring your death
To the heart of this butcher,
My greatest enemy.

He chases after happiness
But knows nothing of how
To make it come.
The slightest unpleasant thing
Is unbearable to him,
And at the same time he's full
Insatiable
Wanting all the wrong things.
With the roar of hell
Smash now the skull
Of my misperceptions,
The ones who have wasted my life;
Bring your death
To the heart of this butcher,

,DGRA BDAG GSHED MA'I SNYING LA M'A RA YA,
He's quick to make new friends
And slow to show consideration
To the ones he has.
His aspirations
Are limited to food,
And he's ready on a moment's notice
To steal, to covet,
To fly into a fury.
With the roar of hell

,DGRA BDAG GSHED MA'I SNYING LA M'A RA YA,
He's a master at trying to get things
Out of others
Through flattery and sweet hints,
But he still talks bad
About everyone.
He's ready in a minute
To make a buck,
But he's so cheap
That what he has

Is glued to his pockets.
With the roar of hell
Smash now the skull
Of my misperceptions,

He makes a great show
Of the troubles he takes
To help others in some
Insignificant way;
At the same time he's dying
For a way to help himself
Without any trouble at all.
With the roar of hell

He has lots of big Lamas
And lots of inability
To keep any of the pledges
That they give him.
He has lots of students

And lots of inability
To give them any real help
When they need it.

He's sworn himself
To every great deed
And actually accomplished
Practically nothing
That is any help to others.
He's famous,
But if you look closely
The angel was kidnapped
By a devil.

The breadth of his spiritual learning
Is about zero,
But his talk is big,
And meaningless.
The breadth of his spiritual study
Is about zero,
But still he's had
A million realizations,
Of realizing nothing.

And has less qualification
Than the devil himself.
He is a high holy Lama,
But his anger and desire
Are crueler than any demon's.

He throws away the idea
Of living an ethical life,
The way to freedom itself,
And instead settles down
In the house where he grew up;

Have any real nature of their own.
There is nothing you should practice,
There is nothing you should give up.
Strip everything of your perceptions.
Leave your mind as it came
From the beginning that never was.
Don't confuse things by trying to understand them.
Live in the place called as-it-is,
And then you will become
A high and holy being.

Use this way to analyze
The apparent Wish for enlightenment
And the ultimate one as well.
With these then you can amass
The collections of merit and wisdom
Without the slightest obstacle,
And come to the perfect accomplishment
Of every single need
That you and others have.

And so here ends "The Wheel of Knives," an instruction which strikes the enemy at
his heart. This work was composed by that great secret practitioner, Dharma Rakshita,
master of scripture and reasoning, and highly realized being, as he lived deep in the
forest, surrounded by every imaginable kind of dangerous wild beast. He wrote it
according to the teachings of the Holy Lamas, and it is a teaching that you should go
now and put into your own life, here in the last degenerate days of the world, full as
they are of their own frightening events.

Dharma Rakshita granted this instruction to Atisha, and Atisha himself followed it
deeply in every corner of the known world, so that when the time came he would be
able to use it to tame the wild minds of his many very difficult disciples. In the end,
he achieved great realizations from this teaching, and composed the following lines in
honor of it:

,KHO BOS RGYAL SRID SPANGS NAS DKA' BA SPYAD PA'I TSE,

,DENG SANG GNYEN PO THUB NAS TSIG SKYA BZUNG ,
You know I renounced a throne and undertook great spiritual hardships;
Because of the karma I thus collected, I was able to meet an incredible Lama.
He granted me the nectar of this holy teaching, and gave me empowerment--
And because it has begun to work for me, I now consider it the holiest word.

You know I delved into the meaning of a wide variety of spiritual schools;
I used my wisdom to search in them, I studied far and wide.
And though I must admit I've seen an infinite display of wonders there,
This teaching is the one I find will help us here in degenerate times.

With these words, Lord Atisha granted this teaching to the Great One with lifetime
layman's vows [Dromtun Je], a veritable reservoir into which the holy Dharma was
poured, and a being who--among all the inconceivably extraordinary disciples of both
India and Tibet--was the single one foretold both by that Enlightened Woman, the
Victorious One, Tara, the Lady of Liberation, and by an unthinkable number of other
close Angels as well. Lord Atisha gave Dromtun Je these instructions to aid him in
his task of taming the wild minds of those first disciples of a faraway and barbarian
land: Tibet. It has also been said, by the great translators and masters of days gone
by, that this teaching actually came down from Lord Buddha, and from his two
spiritual sons.

The instructions then were passed from Lord Atisha down through Potawa, Sharawa,
Chekawa, Chilbupa, Hla Chenpo, Hla Droway Gunpo, Ujowa, Kenpo Martun, and
Kenpo Sherab Dorje.

From them it came down to Kenpo Buddha Ratna, who taught it to Kirti Shila, who
taught it to Gyalwa Sangpo, who taught it to Sunam Rinchen of Nupchu Lung, who
taught it in turn to Gyalchok Konchok Bang.

Which were Passed Down
through the Master Translator of Sumpa

`GU RU NA MO,
I bow down to my holy Lama.

It happened that the accomplished saint named the Master Translator of
Sumpa travelled to India. While there, he was able to study a great deal of the
secret teachings. When it came time for him to return to Tibet, he took the
leftover gold he had with him and set off first to the Seat of the Diamond
[Vajrasana], so that he could make offerings to the site of the Great
Enlightenment.

One day after reaching the Seat of the Diamond he spent some time at the
Great Temple, walking around it in prayer, and sometimes pausing for a rest.
There was a woman there as well, in red; as he watched her walking around
the Temple too, he noticed that for awhile she would be stepping on the
ground, and then for a stretch that she stepped in the air itself, and then on the
ground once more.

Then there was a lady in green, and she walked at the side of the red, and she
said but four things:
I don't feel so well today. I have this urge to get going
somewhere. It would be better if people didn't have to die.
Death is a frightening thing.

DER BUD MED DMAR MO DES LO TZA BA LA SPYAN GYIS ZUR MIG CER BA GCIG GZIGS NAS SNGON MO DE LA MO DE NGA GANG BYUNG GIS CHOG NA CI BYAS KYANG BDE STE KHYOD KYI BLO DE GANG BYUNG GIS MA CHOG PAS LAN PA YIN,
The lady in red turned to the green, and with a sideways glance at the Master
Translator said but four things in reply:
My dear, once you've learned to be satisfied with whatever
comes to you, you will find happiness no matter what happens.
Your problem is that you are never satisfied.

MO DE SEMS BZHAG SAR SDOD NA PHYIN KYANG CHOG STE, KHYOD KYI SEMS DE BZHAG SAR MA SDAD PAS LAN NO, ,
My dear, once you've learned to leave your mind in one place,
you can go wherever you want. Your problem is that you've
never learned to leave your mind in one place.

MO DE BLO CHOS SU SONG NA SHI YANG SLA BA LA KHYOD KYI BLO RGYUN CHOS SU MA SONG BAS LAN NO, ,
My dear, once your mind has sunk into the Dharma, even dying
is an easy thing to do. Your problem is that your mind has never
sunk into the Dharma.

MO DE RANG SEMS SKYE MED DU RTOGS NA 'CHI RGYU YANG MED DE, KHYOD KYI SEMS SKYE MED DU MA RTOGS PAS LAN ZER NAS LAN RNAM PA BZHI 'DEBS KYIN GDA' SKAD,
My dear, once you've realized that the mind is beyond all
beginning, there is no death at all. Your problem is that you've
never realized that the mind is beyond all beginning.

And with these words, all the sadness that the Master Translator had ever felt
in his heart melted away. All the Dharma that he'd ever heard suddenly took
on meaning. And he would say that, at that moment, he gained his greatest
realizations.

Here is what the lines mean. The Master Translator would say that the point
about being satisfied with whatever comes to you means, among other things,

that one must learn to be satisfied with whatever level of material comfort
comes to you, since it concords exactly to the deeds of karma that you yourself
have collected in the past. Don't be jealous of the good things that come to
others. And never let yourself be sucked into events, whether they be pleasant
or unpleasant.

SEMS BZHAG SAR SDAD PAR BYA BA BLA MA'I BYIN BRLABS DANG , THABS KHYAD PAR CAN LA BRTEN NAS SEMS RANG NGO SHES, RANG SA ZIN, RANG DBANG THOB PA LA SOGS PA DGOS,
The point about leaving your mind in one place refers, among other things, to
the fact that you must learn to understand the true nature of your mind, and
keep it in its place, and then gain mastery over it--using the blessings of your
Lama, and unexpected but skilful means, to do so.

SEMS CHOS DANG 'DRES PA NI SEMS RIG RIG PO 'DI YIN, CHOS DE'I RANG BZHIN RTOGS PA CIG DGOS,
The point about mixing your mind with the Dharma refers to that knowingness
of the mind. You must learn to recognize the true nature of this Dharma.

The point about realizing that the mind has no beginning refers to realizing
how the mind begins. "Death" refers to it ending. There is no death anymore
for a person who realizes that the mind has no beginning, and no ending, and
no staying; and whose realization of these things goes on whether they are
within deep meditation or just come out of it.

Here is the lineage through which this teaching has been passed down to us.
It was spoken first to the Master Translator of Sumpa by the pair of the Holy
Angel--the Diamond Sow, Vajra Yogini--and the Lady of Liberation, or Tara.
He taught it to the Sakya Pandita, who passed it on to that great and
accomplished being, Tsotrangwa. He taught it to Kedrup Chuje, he to Ritru
Rechen, he to Prajnya Bodhe, he to Dunshakpa Buddha Ratna, he to Kirti Shila,
he to the Dharma Lord Gyalwa Sangpo, and he to the Dharma Lord Sunam
Rinchen--who granted it, finally, to Konchok Bang.

On a very special day once Lord Atisha was training his mind in the Wish for
enlightenment, bodhichitta, while circling a holy place on foot. Off to the east
then, up in the sky in the direction of the Seat of the Diamond--site of Lord
Buddha's enlightenment--he saw two women. Their bodies were something
just beyond a human form, but something just short of the divine; and they
were covered in precious jewels.

GZHON PA LA RGAN PA DES DRI BA'I TSUL MDZAD NAS MYUR DU 'TSANG RGYA BAR 'DOD PAS

The younger of the two made as if to ask a question of the older:
What method would a person have to train themself in, if he or
she hoped to reach to their Enlightenment most quickly?

MYUR DU 'TSANG RGYA BAR 'DOD PAS BYANG CHUB KYI SEMS SBYONG ZHES GSUNGS NAS GSANG SNGAGS LUGS 'DI GSUNGS SO, ,
And the older of the two replied, in the way of the Secret Word, and said to
the other:
A person who hoped to reach to their Enlightenment most
quickly would have to practice the Wish for Enlightenment.

BUD MED GNYIS SGROL MA DANG KHRO GNYER CAN YIN SKAD,
They say that the two women were the Lady of Liberation and the Woman of
Ferocity.

to Chen-ngawa, he to Jayulpa, he to Tsangpa Rinpoche, he to Langlungpa, he
to Sanggye Gompa, he to Samtse Rinsangpa, and he to Sanggye Gampa
Janchub Kyab. Yeshe Shab granted it to Shila Vadzra, he taught it to Dunshab,
he taught it to Buddha Ratna at Laloy Gunpa, he taught it to Kirti Shila, he
taught it to Jaya Bhadra, and he taught it to Punye Ratna. Punye Ratna,
finally, passed it on to Gyalchok Konchok Bang.
