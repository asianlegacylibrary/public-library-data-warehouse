Here I will, with great feelings of faith and in keeping with my own capacity,
offer a commentary in explanation of the Perfection of Wisdom in 300 Verses,
more commonly known as the Diamond-Cutter. It would seem that this text is
rather difficult to comment upon correctly, for a number of reasons. First of
all, the work is largely devoted to elucidating the meaning of the absence of
a self-nature. Moreover, Lord Buddha repeats himself quite a number of times
during the teaching. Finally, there appears to be but a single explanation of
the work by the masters of ancient India, and none by a Tibetan at all.
Nonetheless, I will undertake a commentary, to the best of my intellectual
ability.

We will proceed in three steps: the preliminaries, the actual body of the text,
and the conclusion. The first part here has three sections of its own: a
translation of the title, along with an explanation of its significance; the
translator's obeisance; and setting the scene. Here is the first.

In the language of India, this teaching is called the Arya Vajra Chedaka
Nama Prajnya Paramita Mahayana Sutra. In the language of Tibet, it is
called the Pakpa Sherab Kyi Paroltu Chinpa Dorje Chupa Shejawa Tekpa
Chenpoy Do. [In the English language, it is called An Exalted Sutra of the
Greater Way on the Perfection of Wisdom, entitled "The Diamond-Cutter."]

The root text here begins with "In the language of India, this text is called the
Arya Vajra..." The Tibetan equivalents of the words in the title are as follows.
Arya means pakpa, [or "exalted."] Vajra means dorje, [or "diamond."]
Chedaka is chupa, [or "cutter."] Prajnya is sherab, [or "wisdom."] Para is
paroltu, [or "to the other side,"] while ita means chinpa, [or "gone," and the
two together mean "perfection."]
Nama is for shejawa, [which means "entitled."] Maha stands for chenpo, [or
"greater."] Yana means tekpa, [which is "way," or "vehicle."] Sutra translates
as do, [or "sutra," meaning the teaching of an enlightened being.]

How do we get this word paramita? The ending am is required between the
words para and ita, to represent the second grammar case. In combination the
a of the am drops out, and the resulting m is attached to the ita, which gives
us mita.

Here is the significance of the name. The worldly god named Hundred Gifts,
or Indra, wields a diamond bolt, which no physical object in the entire world

can destroy. A mere touch of this bolt though can reduce mountains of stone
and other such entities to piles of dust. The subject of this work is the actual
perfection of wisdom; that is, the wisdom with which one perceives emptiness.
The point of the title is that the antithesis of this wisdom can never affect it in
the least; and that the wisdom, on the other hand, cuts from the root
everything involved with the mental afflictions, and each and every suffering.

Third is the third preliminary, where the scene is set. The speaker is the
person who compiled the words of this text, who says "I heard" the following.
Once, meaning at a certain time, the Conqueror was residing at Shravasti, in

the park of Anatapindada at the gardens of Prince Jetavan. In convocation
with him--that is, together with him--were a great gathering of 1,250 monks
who were listeners, as well as an immense number of bodhisattvas who
were great beings.

In India there were six great cities, including the one known as "Shravasti."
This particular city was located in the domain of King Prasenajita, and
contained a particularly excellent site--the exquisite gardens of one known as
Prince Jetavan.

There came a time, several years after the Conqueror attained his
enlightenment, when a certain householder by the name of Anatapindada
resolved that he would construct a large, wondrous temple where Lord
Buddha and his retinue could reside on a regular basis. To this end he
approached Prince Jetavan and purchased his gardens by paying him many
thousands of gold coins, enough in fact to fill the gardens themselves.

Jetavan as well offered to the Conqueror a parcel of land that had been part of
the quarters for the caretakers of the property. In these gardens Anatapindada,
availing himself of the abilities of Shariputra, directed artisans from the lands
of both gods and men to construct an extraordinary park.
When the park was completed, the Conqueror, perceiving that Jetavan wished
it, named the main temple after him. Anatapindada, by the way, was a great
being who had purposely taken a birth as someone who could act as the
Teacher's sponsor. He had the power to see deposits of precious gems and
metals deep under water or below the earth itself, and could utilize these
riches whenever he wished.

In the morning then the Conqueror donned his monk's robes and outer
shawl, took up his sage's bowl, and entered the great city of Shravasti for
requesting his meal. When he had collected the food, he returned from the
city and then partook of it. When he had finished eating he put away his
bowl and shawl, for he was a person who had given up the later meal. He
washed his feet and then seated himself on a cushion that had been set forth
for him. He crossed his legs in the full lotus position, straightened his back,
and placed his thoughts into a state of contemplation.

In the morning then the Conqueror--all for the sake of his disciples--donned
the three parts of a monk's attire, took up his sage's bowl, and went to the
great city of Shravasti for requesting, in order to request, his meal. He
accepted his food and then, after coming back, partook of it.

When he had finished eating he put away his bowl and so on, for he was a

request a meal in the latter part of the day. He washed his feet, bathed them,
and then seated himself on a cushion that had been set forth for him. He
crossed his legs in the full lotus position, and straightened his back. Then
he placed his thoughts into a state of contemplation, knowing that he was
about to deliver this teaching.

We should speak a bit here about the fact that the Conqueror went to request
food. As far as the Buddha is concerned, there is no need at all to go and ask
for his meal. Rather, he does so only so that his disciples will have an
opportunity to collect masses of good karma, or else in order to give
instruction in the Dharma, or for some similar reason.
The Sutra of Golden Light explains how it is completely impossible for a Buddha
to suffer hunger or thirst. And even if they did need to eat or drink
something, it is a complete impossibility that the Buddhas would ever find
themselves without sufficient supplies; they could take care of themselves
perfectly well, for they have gained total mastery over what we call the
"knowledge of the store of space." They have as well the ability, should they
so desire, to turn dirt or stones or other things of the like into gold, or silver,
or precious jewels.
Furthermore they have the power to transform such objects, and also inferior
kinds of food, into feasts of a thousand delectable tastes. No matter how poor
some meal might be, it turns to a matchless, savory banquet as soon as a
Buddha touches it to his lips--delicious in a way that no other kind of being
could ever in his life experience. The Ornament of Realizations is making this
same point when it says "To him, even a terrible taste turns delicious to the
supreme."

There was a time before when, for three months, the Teacher pretended to be
so destitute that he was forced to eat the barley that we usually use for horse
fodder. His disciple Ananda was depressed by the sight, thinking to himself,
"Now the day has come that the Teacher, who was born into royalty, is
reduced to eating horse fodder." The Teacher then took a single piece of the
grain from his mouth, handed it to Ananda, and instructed him to eat it. The
disciple complied, and was filled; in fact, for an entire week thereafter he felt
no urge to eat anything at all, and was overcome with amazement. This
incident applies here too.

The Golden Light relates how--despite the fact that the Teacher appeared to
have to go for requesting his meal--and seemed as well to eat it, in truth he
did not eat, and had no feces or urine either. The Sutra of the Inconceivable
explains as well that the holy body of the Ones Thus Gone are like a lump of
solid gold: there is no cavity inside, and no organs like the stomach, nor large
or small intestines. This is actually the way it is.

And then a great number of monks advanced towards the Conqueror and,
when they had reached his side, bowed and touched their heads to his feet.

They circled him in respect three times, and then seated themselves to one
way. At this point the junior monk Subhuti was with the same group of
disciples, and took his seat with them.

The root text is saying that, then, a great number of monks too advanced to
the side of (which is to say approached) the Conqueror. Then they circled
him in respect three times, and seated themselves to "one way"; that is, they
sat down all together. Not only that, but at this point the respected elder
named Subhuti was with this same group of disciples, and took his seat with
them.

explanation of the actual body of the text. This itself comes in two parts: a
description of how the teaching was initially requested, and then an
explanation of the series of answers that followed. Here is the first of these.

And then the junior monk Subhuti rose from his cushion, and dropped the
corner of his higher robe from one shoulder in a gesture of respect, and
knelt with his right knee to the ground. He faced the Conqueror, joined his
palms at his heart, and bowed. Then he beseeched the Conqueror in the
following words:

The root text next describes how the junior monk Subhuti then rose from the
cushion where he had been seated, and dropped the corner of his "higher"
robe--meaning his upper robe--from his left shoulder in a gesture of respect.
He placed the sole of his left foot on the ground, and then knelt with his right
knee as well. He faced in the direction of the Conqueror, joined his palms
at his heart, and bowed. Then he beseeched the Conqueror in the following
words.

O Conqueror, the Buddha--the One Gone Thus, the Destroyer
of the Enemy, the Totally Enlightened One--has given much
beneficial instruction to the bodhisattvas who are great beings.
Whatever instruction he has ever given has been of benefit.
And the One Gone Thus, the Destroyer of the Enemy, the
Totally Enlightened One, has as well instructed these
bodhisattvas who are great beings by granting them clear
direction. Whatever clear direction he has granted, o
Conqueror, has been a wondrous thing. O Conqueror, it is a
wondrous thing.

To put it simply, Subhuti beseeches the Buddha by saying:
O Conqueror, you have given much instruction to the
bodhisattvas who are great beings; and in a spiritual sense it has
been of the highest benefit, the ultimate help, for both their
present and future lives. Whatever instruction you have ever
given, all of it has been of this same benefit.
You have as well instructed these bodhisattvas by granting
them three kinds of clear direction. You have directed them
towards the source, and towards the dharma, and towards the
commands.
Subhuti then tells the Conqueror how wondrous this is, and so on.

In Master Kamalashila's thinking here the word "source" would refer to
directing a disciple to a spiritual guide. The word "dharma" would signify
how this guide leads his disciple to engage in what is beneficial. And the
"commands" would describe the Buddha's directions: "You, my bodhisattva,
must act to help all living beings."

O Conqueror, what of those who have entered well into the
way of the bodhisattva? How shall they live? How shall they
practice? How should they keep their thoughts?
This did Subhuti ask, and then...

This brings us to the actual way in which the sutra was requested. Subhuti
asks the Conqueror, "What of those who have entered well into the way of
the bodhisattva?" He phrases his question in three different sections: "How
shall they live? How shall they practice? How should they keep their
thoughts?"
Here secondly we explain the Buddha's reply.

...the Conqueror bespoke the following words, in reply to Subhuti's
question:
O Subhuti, it is good, it is good. O Subhuti, thus it is, and
thus is it: the One Thus Gone has indeed done benefit to the
bodhisattvas who are great beings, by granting them beneficial
instruction. The One Thus Gone has indeed given clear
direction to the bodhisattvas who are great beings, by granting
them the clearest of instruction.

The Conqueror is greatly pleased by the request that Subhuti submits to him,
and so he says "It is good." Then he provides his affirmation of the truth of
what Subhuti has spoken, by assenting that the One Thus Gone has indeed
done benefit to the bodhisattvas who are great beings, and has indeed given
them clear direction.

And since it is so, o Subhuti, listen now to what I speak, and

the bodhisattva should live, and how they should practice, and

"And since this reason is so," continues the Buddha, "listen well now to what
I speak, and be sure that it stays firmly, without ever being forgotten. For I
shall reveal to you the answer to those three questions about how these beings
should live, and so on."

"Thus shall it be," replied the junior monk Subhuti, and he sat to listen as
instructed by the Conqueror. The Conqueror too then began, with the
following words:

In reply then Subhuti proffers to the Conqueror, "Thus shall it be." He sits
to listen as instructed by the Conqueror, and the Conqueror too begins his
explanation with the words that follow.
This Subhuti, by the way, is only posing as a disciple: in reality he would
appear to be an emanation of Manjushri himself. When the Teacher spoke the
sutras on the Mother of the Buddhas, it was none other than Subhuti that he
would appoint to give the opening presentations--and there is a special
significance to why he did so.

As for the general structure of the text, Master Kamalashila makes his
presentation in a total of eighteen different points. These begin with relating
the text to the Wish for enlightenment, and then to the perfections, and then
discussing the aspiration for the Buddha's physical body. After covering all the
others, he reaches finally the part where the Buddha has completed his
pronouncement.
Master Kamalashila provides his commentary by relating the first sixteen of
these points to the levels of those who act in belief. The one point that follows
then he relates to the levels of those who act out of total personal
responsibility. Point number eighteen refers, lastly, to the level of a Buddha.
My intention here is to offer a somewhat more concise explanation, and I begin
with the part that concerns the Wish for enlightenment.

The Asian Classics Institute
Course VI: The Diamond-Cutter Sutra
Reading Two: Emptiness and the Wish for Enlightenment
The following selections are taken from the Diamond-Cutter Sutra, spoken by Lord
Buddha (500 BC), and the commentary to it named Sunlight on the Path to
Freedom, by Choney Lama Drakpa Shedrup (1675-1748) of Sera Mey Tibetan
Monastery. The root text is in bold and has been inserted into the commentary.

Subhuti, this is how those who have entered well into the way of the
bodhisattva must think to themselves as they feel the Wish to achieve
enlightenment:

I will bring to nirvana the total amount of living beings, every
single one numbered among the ranks of living kind: those
who were born from eggs, those who were born from a womb,
those who were born through warmth and moisture, those who
were born miraculously, those who have a physical form, those
with none, those with conceptions, those with none, and those
with neither conceptions nor no conceptions. However many
living beings there are, in whatever realms there may
be--anyone at all labelled with the name of "living being"--all
these will I bring to total nirvana, to the sphere beyond all
grief, where none of the parts of the person are left at all. Yet
even if I do manage to bring this limitless number of living
beings to total nirvana, there will be no living being at all who
was brought to total nirvana.

What the root text is saying is: "Subhuti, this is how those who have entered
the way of the bodhisattva must think to themselves first as they feel the
Wish to achieve enlightenment:
Whatever realms there may be, and however many living
beings there are, they reach to infinity, they are countless. If one
were to classify those numbered among the ranks of living kind
by type of birth, there would be four: those who were born from
eggs, and then those who were born from a womb, those who
were born through warmth and moisture, and those who were
born miraculously.
Then again there are the sentient beings living in the desire realm
and the form realm: those who have a physical form. There are
also the beings in the formless realm: those with no physical
form.
There are "those with conceptions," meaning the beings who live
in all the levels except the ones known as the "great result" and
the "peak of existence." There are "those with no conceptions,"
which refers to a portion of the beings who reside at the level of
the great result. In addition are the beings who have been born
at the level of the peak of existence: those with no coarse kinds
of conceptions but who on the other hand are not such that they
have no subtle conceptions.
The point, in short, is that I speak of all living beings: of anyone
at all labelled with the name of "living being." All these will
I bring to total nirvana, to the sphere beyond all grief, where
one no longer remains in either of the extremes--and where
none of the two kinds of obstacles, and none of the suffering
heaps of parts to the person, are left at all.

To summarize, these bodhisattvas develop the Wish for the sake of bringing
all these different living beings to the state of that nirvana where one no longer
remains in either of the extremes; to bring them to the dharma body, the
essence body, of the Buddha. The reference here is either to someone who is
feeling the Wish for the first time, or to someone who has already been able
to develop it. The first of these two has been practicing the emotion of great
compassion, where one wishes to protect all living beings from any of the three
different kinds of suffering they may be experiencing. This has made him
ready for his first experience of the state of mind where he intends to lead all
sentient kind to the ultimate nirvana. The latter of the two, the one who has
already developed the Wish, is re-focussing his mind on his mission, and thus
increasing the intensity of his Wish.

Here is a little on the four types of birth. Birth from an egg exists among
humans, serpentines, birds, and other creatures. Birth from the womb is found
with humans and animals, and is also one of the ways in which craving spirits
take birth. There are many examples of inanimate objects which grow from
warmth and moisture--crops and so on. Among humans though there was the
case of the king called "Headborn." The majority of the insects which appear
in the summer are also born this way. Miraculous birth occurs with the
humans who appear at the beginning of the world, and with pleasure beings,
hell beings, inbetween beings, and near pleasure-beings. It is also one of the
ways in which animals take birth. An example of birth from an egg among
humans would be the story that we see of Saga, who possessed the lifetime

vows of a laywoman. She gave a great number of eggs, and from these eggs
grew boys.

The above description applies to the way in which a person thinks as he or she
feels what we call the "deceptive" Wish for enlightenment. It refers both to
the Wish in the form of a prayer and to the Wish in the form of actual
activities. I would say as well that Lord Buddha's intention at this point is to
refer primarily to the Wish as it occurs at the paths of accumulation and of
preparation.

For a person to feel a Wish for enlightenment which is complete in every
necessary characteristic, it is not sufficient simply to intend to lead all other
sentient beings to the state of Buddhahood. Rather, you must have the desire
that you yourself reach this state as well. This is exactly why Maitreya stated
that "The Wish for enlightenment consists of the intention to reach total
enlightenment for the sake of others." The part about "the sake of others" is
meant to indicate that you must intend to lead other beings to nirvana,
whereas the part about the "intention to reach total enlightenment" means that
you must intend to reach perfect Buddhahood yourself.

Lord Buddha wants us to understand that this Wish for enlightenment must
be imbued with that correct view wherein you perceive that nothing has a self-
nature. This is why He states that we must develop a Wish for enlightenment
where we intend to lead this limitless number of living beings to the nirvana
beyond both extremes, but where at the same time we realize that, even if we
do manage to bring them to this total nirvana, there will be no living being
at all who achieved it, and who also existed ultimately.

The Tibetan term for "nirvana" means "passing beyond sorrow." The "sorrow"
mentioned here refers to the pair of karma and mental afflictions, as well as to
suffering. The nirvana to which you wish to bring beings then refers to a state
of escaping from the combination of karma and bad thoughts, along with
suffering: it means to go beyond them. This is why the unusual Tibetan verb
here refers not only to nirvana, but to the act of bringing someone to nirvana
as well. The root text at this point is meant to indicate that ordinary beings
can possess something that approximates the ultimate Wish for enlightenment.
It is also indicating the existence of the actual ultimate Wish for enlightenment,
which only realized beings possess.

At this juncture in his commentary, Master Kamalashila presents a great deal
of explanation concerning the correct view of reality. He does so because he
realizes that this background is very important for a proper understanding of
the remainder of the root text, which is all spoken relative to the correct view
of emptiness. If I did the same here in my own commentary I fear it would
become too long for the reader, and so I will cover some of these points now,
but only in the very briefest way, just to give you a taste.

Now each and every existing object, be it part of the afflicted part of existence
or part of the pure side, is established as existing only by virtue of terms. If
one performs an analysis with reasoning which examines an object in an
ultimate sense, no object can bear such examination, and we fail to locate what
we gave our label. Here the thing we deny is easier to deny if we can identify
it clearly. As such I will speak a bit about what this thing we deny is like.

Generally speaking there are a great number of different positions that exist
about what the object we deny exactly is. Here though I will give my
explanation according to the position of the Consequence section of the Middle
Way school. A certain sutra says that "They are all established through
concepts." The Commentary to the Four Hundred too contains lines such as the
one which says, "It is only due to the existence of concepts that existence itself
can exist, and..." The Lord, in his Illumination of the True Thought, says as well
that "These lines [from sutra] are describing how all existing things are
established by force of concepts; and we see many other such statements, that

all existing objects are simply labelled with our concepts, and are established
only by force of concepts."

There is a metaphor used to describe how all existing things are labelled with
our concepts. When you put a rope with a checkered pattern on it in a dark
corner, some people might get the impression that it's a snake. The truth at
this point though is that nothing about the rope is a snake: neither the rope as
a whole, nor the parts of the rope. Nonetheless the person thinks of the rope
as a snake, and this snake is an example of something which only makes its
appearance as something labelled with a concept.

In the same way, the heaps of parts that make us up serve as a basis for us to
get the impression "This is me." There is nothing at all about these heaps as
a whole, nor their continuation over time, nor their separate components, that
we could establish as being an actual representation of "me." At the same time
though there is nothing else, nothing essentially separate from these heaps of
parts to ourselves, that we could consider an actual representation of "me"
either. As such, this "me" is merely something labelled upon the heaps of parts
that make us up; there is nothing which exists by its own essence.

This too is the point being made in the String of Precious Jewels, by the realized
being Nagarjuna:
If it's true that the persona is not the element
Of earth, nor water, nor fire, nor wind,
Not space, or consciousness, not all of them,
Then how could he ever be anything else?
The part of the verse that goes from "not earth" up to "not consciousness" is
meant to deny that you could ever establish a self-nature of the person in any
of the six elements that make up a persona, considered separately. The words
"not all of them" are meant to deny that you could establish such a self-nature
in the collection of the six elements, considered as a whole. The final line of
the verse denies that there could be any self-nature which was essentially
separate from these same elements.

How then do we establish the existence of the persona (which in this case
simply means "person")? The same work says:
Because the persona includes all six
Elements, he's nothing that purely exists;
Just so, because they include their parts,
None of these elements purely exist.
Given the reason stated above, the persona is nothing more than something
labelled upon the six elements that make him up--he does not though purely
exist.

Just so none of these elements themselves exist purely, for they too are simply
labelled upon the parts that they include. This same reasoning can be applied
to the heaps of parts that make up a person, and all other objects as well: you
can say about all of them that, because they are labelled on their parts and
their whole, they do not exist independently. The physical heap of parts that
I myself possess is something labelled upon my five appendages and so on;
these appendages themselves are something labelled upon the body as a whole
and the parts that go off to each side of it; and the smaller appendages like
fingers and toes too are labelled upon their whole and their parts.

A water pitcher is something labelled on its spout and base and other parts;
the spout and base and such in turn are labelled on their parts and whole; and
so on--the same pattern applies to all physical objects. Mental things too are
labelled on mental events of successive moments, and through the objects
towards which they function, and so on. Even uncaused phenomena are
labelled upon the respective bases that take their labels. All this I have
covered before, in other writings.

Given the above, there does not exist anything which does not occur in
dependence, or which is not labelled through a dependent relationship.
Therefore the point at which we can say something is the object denied by our
search for a hypothetical self-existent thing would be any time that thing
existed without having been labelled through a dependent relationship. This
too is why the Root Text on Wisdom states:
No object which does not occur
Through dependence even exists at all;
As such no object could exist
At all if it weren't empty.

In short, when you search for the thing given the name of "self" or "me" you
will never find anything; despite this, the fact that things can do something is
completely right and proper, in the sense of an illusion, or magic. And this
fact applies to each and every existing thing there is. As the Shorter [Sutra on
the Perfection of Wisdom] states,
You should understand that the nature of every single living is the
same as that of the "self."
You should understand that the nature of all existing objects is the same
as that of every living being.

The King of Concentration says as well,
You should apply what you understand about how
You think of your "self" to every thing there is.

All this is true as well for objects like the perfection of giving and so on: they
exist only through being labelled with a term, and are empty of any natural
existence. Seeking to make us realize how necessary it is to understand this
fact, Lord Buddha makes statements like "Perform the act of giving without
believing in any object at all."

This is the most important thing for us to learn: so long as we are still not free
of the chains of grasping to things as truly existing, and so long as we have yet
to grasp the meaning of emptiness, then we will never be able to achieve
freedom, even if the Buddha should appear himself and try to lead us there.
This is supported by the words of the savior Nagarjuna:
Freedom is a complete impossibility
For anyone who does not understand emptiness.
Those who are blind will continue to circle
Here in the prison of six different births.
Master Aryadeva as well has spoken that "For those who conceive of things,
freedom does not exist." And there are many other such quotations.

,DE CI'I PHYIR ZHE NA, RAB 'BYOR, GAL TE BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA' SEMS CAN DU 'DU

Why is it so? Because, Subhuti, if a bodhisattva were to conceive of
someone as a living being, then we could never call him a "bodhisattva."

Here we return to where we left off in the root text. One may ask, "Why is it
so? What reason is there for saying that we should develop a Wish for
enlightenment, while still understanding that there is no truly existing sentient
being at all who ever achieves it?" Lord Buddha first calls Subhuti by name,
and then explains that we could never call any particular bodhisattva a
"bodhisattva who had realized the meaning of no-self-nature" if this
bodhisattva were to conceive of any living being as a living being who
existed truly.

Course VI: The Diamond-Cutter Sutra
Reading Three: Emptiness and the Bodies of a Buddha
The following selections are taken from Sunlight on the Path to Freedom, written
by Choney Lama Drakpa Shedrup (1675-1748) of Sera Mey Tibetan Monastery. The
original root text of the sutra by Lord Buddha is included in darker type.

,DE CI'I PHYIR ZHE NA, RAB 'BYOR, BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA' GANG MI GNAS PAR SBYIN PA SBYIN PA DE'I BSOD NAMS KYI PHUNG PO NI, RAB 'BYOR, TSAD GZUNG BAR SLA BA MA YIN PA'I PHYIR RO,
Why is that? Think, o Subhuti, of the mountains of merit collected
by any bodhisattva who performs the act of giving without staying.
This merit, o Subhuti, is not something that you could easily ever
measure.

One would have to admit that a person locked in the chains of grasping to
some true existence can collect a great amount of merit through acts of giving
and the like. But suppose a person is able to practice giving and the rest after

he has freed himself from these same chains. His merit then is certain to be
ever much greater. And it is to emphasize this point that the Buddha says,
Why is that? Think, o Subhuti, of the mountains of merit collected by any
bodhisattva who performs the act of giving without staying. This merit is
not something whose limit you could easily ever measure; in fact, it would
be quite difficult to measure.

O Subhuti, what do you think? Would it be easy to measure
the space to the east of us?
And Subhuti replied,
O Conqueror, it would not.
The Conqueror bespoke:
And just so, would it be easy to measure the space to the south
of us, or to the north of us, or above us, or below us, or in any
of the ordinal directions from us? Would it be easy to measure
the space to any of the ten directions from where we now
stand?
And Subhuti replied,
O Conqueror, it would not.

The Conqueror bespoke:
And just so, o Subhuti, it would be no easy thing to measure
the mountains of merit collected by any bodhisattva who
performs the act of giving without staying.

The root text here is presenting an example. It would be no easy thing to
measure the space to the east or any of the rest of the ten directions reaching
out from the particular point where we are now. Then the Buddha
summarizes the point of the example with the words that start with "Just so,
Subhuti..."

,RAB 'BYOR, 'DI JI SNYAM DU SEMS, MTSAN PHUN SUM TSOGS PAS DE BZHIN GSHEGS PAR BLTA'AM, RAB 'BYOR GYIS GSOL PA, BCOM LDAN 'DAS, DE NI, MA LAGS TE, MTSAN PHUN SUM TSOGS PAS DE BZHIN GSHEGS PAR MI BLTA'O, , DE CI'I SLAD DU ZHE NA, DE BZHIN GSHEGS PAS MTSAN PHUN SUM TSOGS PAR GANG GSUNGS PA DE NYID MTSAN PHUN SUM TSOGS PA MA MCHIS PA'I SLAD DU'O, , DE SKAD CES GSOL PA DANG , BCOM LDAN 'DAS KYIS TSE DANG LDAN PA RAB 'BYOR LA 'DI SKAD CES BKA' STZAL TO,
O Subhuti, what do you think? Should we consider someone
to be the One Thus Gone because he possesses the totally
exquisite marks on a Buddha's body?
And Subhuti replied,
O Conqueror, we should not. We should not consider someone
the One Thus Gone because he possesses the totally exquisite
marks on a Buddha's body. And why not? Because when the

One Thus Gone himself described the totally exquisite marks
on a Buddha's body, he stated at the same time that they were
impossible.
And then the Conqueror spoke to the junior monk Subhuti again, as follows:
 , SBYIN SOGS BSOD NAMS KYI TSOGS LAS SANGS RGYAS KYI GZUGS SKU 'GRUB PAR 'GYUR ZHING , GZUGS KYI SKU NI MTSAN DPES BRGYAN PA'O, , RAB 'BYOR 'DI JI SNYAM DU SEMS ZHES PA NI, RAB 'BYOR KHYOD KYIS DON 'DI LA JI LTAR YIN SNYAM DU SEMS PA STE BSAM, DE BZHIN GSHEGS PA'I GZUGS KYI SKU RNAM PA GNYIS NI MTSAN DPE PHUN SUM TSOGS PA DANG LDAN PA YIN MOD, 'ON KYANG MTSAN DPE PHUN SUM TSOGS PA YOD PA DE TZAM GYIS DE BZHIN GSHEGS PAR LTA BA STE 'DOD PAR BYA BA YIN SNYAM MA'AM ZHES DRIS PA NA, RAB 'BYOR GYIS BCOM LDAN 'DAS DE NI DE LTAR BLTA BA MA LAGS SO ZHES GSOL TE, CUNG ZAD DBYE BA NI MTSAN DPE PHUN SUM TSOGS PA YOD PA DE TZAM GYIS DE BZHIN GSHEGS PAR BLTA BAR MI BGYID DE, DE CI'I SLAD DU ZHE NA, DE BZHIN GSHEGS PAS GZUGS KYI SKU'I MTSAN DPE PHUN SUM TSOGS PA GANG GSUNGS PA DE NYID KUN RDZOB TU SGYU MA LTAR YOD PAR GSUNGS KYI, DON DAM PAR MTSAN DPE PHUN SUM TSOGS PA MA MCHIS PA'I SLAD DU'O ZHES GSOL TO,
The merit of acts such as giving and the rest bring us the physical body of a
Buddha, and this physical body is adorned with various marks and signs. The
words "Subhuti, what do you think?" mean "Subhuti, turn your mind to this
subject, and think about how it could be--contemplate upon it."
The Buddha then asks Subhuti, "Assume for a minute that someone possessed
the totally exquisite marks and signs, or the two physical bodies, of the One
Thus Gone. Would that in itself require us to consider him--that is, assert
that he is--the One Thus Gone? What do you think?"

Subhuti replies to the Buddha with the words starting off from, "We should
not consider him so." At this point we have to draw a slight distinction. One
should not necessarily consider someone the One Thus Gone simply because
he possesses the totally exquisite marks and signs. "And why not?" says
Subhuti. He answers himself by saying, "Because when the One Thus Gone
himself described the totally exquisite marks and signs on a Buddha's body,
he stated at the same time that they existed deceptively, in the way of an
illusion. Signs and marks of this kind that existed ultimately, however, would
be a complete impossibility."

,RAB 'BYOR, 'DI JI SNYAM DU SEMS, MTSAN PHUN SUM TSOGS PA DE TZAM DU RDZUN NO, , JI TZAM DU MTSAN PHUN SUM TSOGS PA MED PA DE TZAM DU MI RDZUN TE, DE LTAR DE BZHIN GSHEGS PA LA MTSAN DANG MTSAN MED PAR BLTA'O, , DE SKAD CES BKA' STZAL PA DANG , BCOM LDAN 'DAS LA TSE DANG LDAN PA RAB 'BYOR GYIS 'DI SKAD CES GSOL TO,
O Subhuti, what do you think? The totally exquisite marks on
a Buddha's body, as such, are deceptive. The totally exquisite
marks on a Buddha's body are also not deceptive, but only
insofar as they do not exist. Thus you should see the One
Thus Gone as having no marks, no marks at all.
Thus did the Conqueror speak. And then the junior monk Subhuti replied
to the Conqueror, as follows:

,GZUGS SKU'I MTSAN DPE RNAMS NI RI MOS BRIS PA'I GZUGS BRNYAN LTAR RKYEN TSOGS PA LAS BYUNG BA'I KUN RDZOB BRDZUN PA'I GNAS TSUL YIN GYI, BDEN PA'I RANG BZHIN MIN NO ZHES STON PA NI, BCOM LDAN 'DAS KYIS RAB 'BYOR LA CI TZAM DU MTSAN PHUN SUM TSOGS PA DE TZAM DU BRDZUN NO ZHES GSUNGS, 'O NA MI BRDZUN PA GANG ZHE NA, JI TZAM DU MTSAN DPE PHUN SUM TSOGS PA RNAMS BDEN PAR MED PA DE TZAM NI MI BRDZUN ZHING BDEN TE, DE LTAR DE BZHIN GSHEGS PA LA BDEN PAR GRUB PA'I MTSAN DANG MTSAN MA MED PAR BLTA BAR BYA'O, , 'DIS GZUGS SKU LA MTHA' GNYIS SEL TE, GZUGS

The marks and signs on the physical body of the Buddha are like an image
drawn on a piece of paper: they are not the real thing--they exist in a
deceptive manner, as things that occur when all of their causes have gathered
together. They do not exist as something with a true nature. To indicate this
fact, Lord Buddha says to Subhuti, "Insofar as the totally exquisite marks on
a Buddha's body exist, as such they are deceptive.
"Just what," you may ask, "is meant by the word deceptive?" The totally
exquisite marks and signs on a Buddha's body are also not deceptive, and
true, but only insofar as they do not exist truly. Thus you should see the
One Thus Gone as having no marks, no marks to indicate his nature, at all.
The section here helps to prevent us from falling into either one of the two
extremes. The physical body of the Buddha and its various marks and signs
do exist--albeit in a deceptive way, in a false or empty way--and this fact
keeps us from the extreme of denying the existence of something which
actually does exist.
The text though also states that there exist no marks, and no marks that would
indicate any nature, which also exist truly. This fact keeps us from the extreme
of asserting the existence of something which actually does not exist. The
former of these two [marks] is referring to the physical body of a Buddha. The
latter is referring to the dharma body, and chiefly to the essence body.

Reading Four: The Future of the Buddha's Teaching
The following selections are taken from Sunlight on the Path to Freedom, written
by Choney Lama Drakpa Shedrup (1675-1748) of Sera Mey Tibetan Monastery. The
original root text of the sutra by Lord Buddha is included in darker type.

O Conqueror, what will happen in the future, in the days of
the last five hundred, when the holy Dharma is approaching its
final destruction? How could anyone of those times ever see
accurately the meaning of the explanations given in sutras such
as this one?
And the Conqueror bespoke,
O Subhuti, you should never ask the question you have just
asked: "What will happen in the future, in the days of the last
five hundred, when the Dharma is approaching its final

destruction? How could anyone of those times ever see
accurately the meaning of the explanations given in sutras such
as this one?"

The issue is whether or not there will be anyone at all in the future who
believes in, or has any great interest in, sutras such as this one--sutras which
explain the nature of the dharma body, and the physical body, of a Buddha.
In order to raise this issue, Subhuti asks the question that begins with "O
Conqueror, what will happen in the future, in the days of the last five
hundred, when the holy Dharma is approaching its final destruction?"
In reply, the Conqueror speaks: "O Subhuti, you should never ask the
question you have just asked." What he means here is that Subhuti should
never entertain the uncertainty of wondering whether or not there will be
anyone of this type in the future; and if he never had this doubt, Subhuti
would never ask the question.

And again the Buddha bespoke,
O Subhuti, in the future, in the days of the last five hundred,
when the holy Dharma is approaching its final destruction,
there will come bodhisattvas who are great beings, who possess
morality, who possess the fine quality, and who possess
wisdom.
And these bodhisattvas who are great beings, o Subhuti, will
not be ones who have rendered honor to a single Buddha, or
who have collected stores of virtue with a single Buddha.
Instead, o Subhuti, they will be ones who have rendered honor
to many hundreds of thousands of Buddhas, and who have
collected stores of virtue with many hundreds of thousands of
Buddhas. Such are the bodhisattvas, the great beings, who
then will come.

O Subhuti, says the text, in the future, even when the holy Dharma is
approaching its final destruction, there will come bodhisattvas who are great
beings. They will possess the extraordinary form of the training of morality;
they will possess that fine quality which consists of the extraordinary form
of the training of concentration, and they will possess the extraordinary form
of the training of wisdom.

And these bodhisattvas who are great beings will not be ones who have
rendered honor to or collected stores of virtue with only a single Buddha, but
instead they will be ones who have rendered honor to and collected stores
of virtue with many hundreds of thousands of Buddhas. This fact, says the
Conqueror, is something I can perceive right now.

Master Kamalashila explains the expression "days of the last five hundred" as
follows:
"Five hundred" here refers to a group of five hundreds; it refers
to the well-known saying that "The teachings of the Conqueror
will remain for five times five hundred."
As such, the "five times five hundred" refers to the length of time that the
teachings will remain in the world: 2,500 years.
On the question of just how long the teachings will survive in this world, we
see a number of different explanations in the various sutras and commentaries
upon them. These state that the teachings of the Able One will last for a
thousand years, or two thousand, or two and a half thousand, or five thousand
years. When we consider their intent though these various statements, they are
not in contradiction with each other.

The reason for their lack of contradiction is that some of these works are meant
to refer to the length of time that people will still be achieving goals, or still be
practicing. Still others refer to the length of time that the physical records of
these teachings remain in our world. Some, finally, appear to be referring to
the Land of the Realized [India].
There are many examples of the kinds of bodhisattvas mentioned in the text.
In the Land of the Realized, there have been the "Six Jewels of the World of
Dzambu," and others like them. In Tibet there have been high beings like the
Sakya Pandita, or Buton Rinpoche, or the Three Lords--the father and his
spiritual sons.

O Subhuti, suppose a person reaches even just a single feeling
of faith for the words of a sutra such as this one. The One
Thus Gone, o Subhuti, knows any such person. The One Thus
Gone, o Subhuti, sees any such person. Such a person, o
Subhuti, has produced, and gathered safely into himself, a
mountain of merit beyond any estimation.

Suppose, says the text, that a person of those future days learns, and then
contemplates, a sutra such as his one; that is, a scripture which teaches the
perfection of wisdom. And say further that this brings him to reach, or
develop, even just a single feeling of admiration for this teaching--much less
any frequent emotion of faith for it. From this moment on the One Thus
Gone knows and sees that any such person has produced, and gathered
safely into himself, a mountain of merit beyond any estimation. He "knows"
the person's thoughts, and "sees" his visual form and such.

Why is it so? Because, Subhuti, these bodhisattvas who are
great beings entertain no conception of something as a self, nor
do they entertain any conception of something as a living
being, nor any conception of something as being alive, nor any
conception of something as a person.

MI 'JUG PA NI BDAG MED RTOGS PA'I SKABS LA DGONGS SO,
One may ask the reason why the above is so. It's because these particular
bodhisattvas will entertain no manifest conception of something as a self, or
as a living being, or as being alive, or as a person. The denotation of the
words "self" and "person" and so on here are the same as I have mentioned
earlier. Master Kamalashila at this point says:
The expression "conceive of something as a self" means thinking
"me," or grasping that the self exists. "Conceiving of something
as a living being" means grasping that something belonging to
the self exists. "Conceiving of something as being alive" means
continuing to grasp to the same "self" as above, but for the entire
length of its life. "Conceiving of something as a person" means
grasping that those who are born again and again are born.
Thus the meaning of grasping to something as belonging to the self is a bit
different than before.
When the text says that these bodhisattvas entertain no such coarse
conceptions, it is referring specifically to the occasions at which one realizes
the lack of a self-nature.

O Subhuti, these bodhisattvas who are great beings neither entertain any
conception of things as things, nor do they entertain any conception of
things as not being things. They neither entertain any conception of a
thought as a conception, nor do they entertain any conception of a thought
as not being conception.
Why is it so? Because if, o Subhuti, these bodhisattvas who are great beings
were to entertain any conception of things as things, then they would grasp
these same things as being a "self"; they would grasp them as being a living
being; they would grasp them as being something that lives; they would
grasp them as a person.
And even if they were to entertain them as not being things, that too they
would grasp as being a "self"; they would grasp as being a living being; they
would grasp as being something that lives; they would grasp as a person.

The text is saying: "Not only do these beings avoid entertaining a belief in
things as being something true; neither do they entertain any conception of
physical form and other things as being true things nominally. Nor as well
do they entertain any conception where they believe that these things are not
things."
From another point of view, it is appropriate as well to gloss the passage as
follows. Physical form and other such things are deceptive objects, and
deceptive objects are not something which is true. These bodhisattvas avoid
entertaining even the conception where one believes that this fact itself is

something true. If one in fact did entertain such a conception, then certain
problems would arise--and this explains the relevance of the two paragraphs
that come next in the root text, the one that mentions "If they were to
entertain any conception of things as things" and so on; and the other that
starts with "If they were to entertain them as not being things" that had a
self.

Course VI: The Diamond-Cutter Sutra
Reading Five: Emptiness and Karma
The following selections are taken from Sunlight on the Path to Freedom, written
by Choney Lama Drakpa Shedrup (1675-1748) of Sera Mey Tibetan Monastery. The
original root text of the sutra by Lord Buddha is included in darker type.

The Conqueror bespoke:
O Subhuti, what do you think? Suppose some son or daughter
of noble family were to take all the planets of this great world
system, a system with a thousand of a thousand of a thousand
planets, and fill them all up with the seven kinds of precious
substances, and offer them to someone. Would that son or
daughter of noble family create many great mountains of merit
from such a deed?

With this next section of the sutra, Lord Buddha wishes to demonstrate a
certain fact. In the sections above we have spoken about the act of becoming
enlightened, and of teaching the dharma, and so on. Neither these, nor any
other object in the universe, exists ultimately. Nonetheless, they do exist
nominally. As such, one would have to admit that anyone who performs an
act of giving does acquire great merit thereby. Yet anyone who carries out the
process of learning, or contemplating, or meditating upon this teaching
acquires infinitely greater merit.
To convey this point, the Conqueror asks Subhuti the question beginning with
"What do you think? Suppose some son or daughter of noble family were
to take this great world system, a system with a thousand of a thousand of
a thousand planets..." The system mentioned here is described in the Treasure
House [of Higher Knowledge, the Abhidharmakosha,] as follows:
A thousand sets of all four continents with
A sun and moon, Mount Supreme, pleasure
Beings of the desire, and world of the
Pure agreed as an elementary system.
A thousand of these is a second-order kind,
The intermediate type of world system.
A third-order system is a thousand of these.

"Suppose further," continues Lord Buddha, "that they were to fill up this
system of planets with the seven kinds of precious substances: with gold,
silver, crystal, lapis, the gem essence [emerald], karketana stone, and crimson
pearl. And say then that they offered them to someone. Would they create
many great mountains of merit from such a deed, from giving someone else
such a gift?"

And Subhuti replied,
O Conqueror, many would it be. O Conqueror, it would be
many. This son or daughter of noble family would indeed
create many great mountains of merit from such a deed. And
why so? Because, o Conqueror, these same great mountains of
merit are great mountains of merit that could never exist. And
for this very reason do the Ones Thus Gone speak of "great
mountains of merit, great mountains of merit."

In response, Subhuti replies:
It would be many great mountains of merit--and these great
mountains of merit are mountains of merit that we could
establish as existing only in name, only in the way that a dream
or an illusion exists: these same great mountains of merit
though could never exist as mountains that existed ultimately.
The Ones Thus Gone as well speak in a nominal sense of "great
mountains of merit, great mountains of merit"--applying the
name to them.
This section is meant to demonstrate a number of different points. Black and
white deeds that you have committed before now, and which you are going
to commit later, are such that the ones in the past have stopped, and the ones
in the future are yet to come. Therefore they are non-existent, but we have to
agree that, generally speaking, they exist. We also have to agree that they are
connected to the mind stream of the person who committed them, and that
they produce their appropriate consequences for this person. These and other
difficult issues are raised in the words above.

And the Conqueror bespoke:
O Subhuti, suppose some son or daughter of noble family were
to take all the planets of this great world system, a system with
a thousand of a thousand of a thousand planets, and fill them
all up with the seven kinds of precious substances, and offer

them to someone. Suppose on the other hand that one of them
held but a single verse of four lines from this particular
dharma, and explained it to others, and taught it correctly. By
doing the latter, this person would create many more great
mountains of merit than with the former: they would be
countless, and beyond all estimation.

We should first say something about the word "verse" here. Although the
sutra in Tibetan is not written in verse, the idea is that one could put it into
verse in Sanskrit. The word "hold" refers to "holding in the mind," or
memorizing. It can also apply to holding a volume in one's hand and, in either
case, reciting the text out loud.
The phrase "explain it correctly" is explained as stating the words of the sutra
and explaining them well. The phrase "teach it correctly" is explained as
teaching the meaning of the sutra well, and this is the most important part.
Suppose now that one held the sutra and did the other things mentioned with
it, rather than the other good deed described. This person would then create
great mountains of merit that were ever more countless, and beyond all
estimation.

'DI LAS BYUNG STE, SANGS RGYAS BCOM LDAN 'DAS RNAMS KYANG 'DI LAS SKYES PA'I PHYIR RO,
Why is it so? Because, Subhuti, this is where the matchless
and totally perfect enlightenment of the Ones Thus Gone, the
Destroyers of the Foe, the Totally Enlightened Buddhas, comes
from. It is from this as well that the Buddhas, the Conquerors,
are born.

The reason for this is as follows. The act of giving someone the dharma is of
much more benefit that the act of giving material things. Not only that, but
the enlightenment of the totally enlightened Buddhas comes from--is
achieved through--the perfection of wisdom: the realization of emptiness
which forms the subject matter of this text. It is from putting this into practice
as well that the Buddhas, the Conquerors, are born.

Reading Seven: Emptiness and the Destruction of the Mental
Afflictions
The following selections are taken from Sunlight on the Path to Freedom, written
by Choney Lama Drakpa Shedrup (1675-1748) of Sera Mey Tibetan Monastery. The
original root text of the sutra by Lord Buddha is marked with an ornament in the
Tibetan and bold in the English.

O Conqueror, I declare that the Ones Thus Gone--those
Destroyers of the Foe who are the Totally Enlightened
Buddhas--reside in the highest of all those states that are free
of the mental afflictions. I am, o Conqueror, a person who is
free of desire; I am a foe destroyer.

But I do not, o Conqueror, think to myself, "I am a foe
destroyer." For suppose, o Conqueror, that I did think to
myself, "I have attained this very state, the state of a foe
destoyer." If I did think this way, then the One Thus Gone
could never have given me the final prediction: he could never
have said: "O son of noble family, o Subhuti, you will reach
the highest of all those states that are free of the mental
afflictions. Because you stay in no state at all, you have
reached the state free of mental afflictions; you have reached
what we call the 'state free of mental afflictions.'

Then Subhuti explains, "I am, nominally speaking, a foe destroyer. But it is
also true that I do not, while grasping to some true existence, think to myself,
"I am a foe destroyer." If I did grasp to it this way then I would start to have
mental afflictions, and then I would stop being a foe destroyer. I am a foe
destroyer, and the Conqueror has given me the final prediction: he has told
me, "Nominally speaking Subhuti, son of noble family, you will reach the
highest of all those states that are free of the mental afflictions." In an
ultimate sense though, because I stay in no state at all, he could never have
given me the final prediction, he could never have said, "O son of noble
family, o Subhuti, you will reach the state free of mental afflictions." This
is because, ultimately speaking, there does not even exist any place to stay, no
thing to make one stay there, nor even anyone who stays there. All this is
consistent with the position of the Consequence school, which says that
grasping to some true existence is a mental affliction.

The Conqueror bespoke:
O Subhuti, what do you think? Was there any dharma at all
which the One Thus Gone took up from that One Thus Gone,
the Destroyer of the Foe, the Perfectly Enlightened Buddha
called "Maker of Light"?
And Subhuti respectfully replied,
O Conqueror, there was not. There exists no dharma at all
which the One Thus Gone received, the One Thus Gone took
up from that One Thus Gone, the Destroyer of the Foe, the
Perfectly Enlightened Buddha called "Maker of Light."

Ultimately speaking then there is nothing for one to achieve, and nothing that
helps one achieve it, and no one even to do the achieving. But we can say
even further that, again speaking ultimately, there is no dharma at all that one
takes up, and practices. In order to demonstrate this point, Lord Buddha states
the following.

The Conqueror asks, "O Subhuti, do you think that there was any dharma
at all which I, the One Thus Gone, in those days long ago took up, ultimately
speaking, from the Buddha called 'Maker of Light'?"
And Subhuti offers up the reply, "No, there was no such dharma."

This specific reference, wherein Lord Buddha speaks of the Buddha "Maker of
Light" by name, recalls an event which had taken place long before. In those
times our Teacher was a youth known as "Cloud of Dharma." Due to the
blessing of the Buddha "Maker of Light," he was able to achieve a stage known
as the "great mastery of things that never grow," and to bring about the eighth
bodhisattva level. When this had happened, Light Maker gave him the final
prediction, saying "In the future, you will become the Buddha known as
'Shakyamuni'." In order to remember the kindness that Light Maker paid on
this occasion, I will speak more of this later on.
We should say a little about this expression, the "great mastery of things that
never grow." This refers to a point at which one has eliminated the mental
afflictions, and achieved total mastery, fluency, in meditating upon non-
conceptual wisdom, which perceives directly each and every instance of the
very nature of all things, their emptiness of any natural existence. As such, all
caused objects appear to this person exclusively in the nature of an illusion, as
empty of any true existence, not only during periods of deep meditation but
during the times between these meditations as well.

When one reaches the stage of the great mastery of things that never grow, one

that what was predicted to finally happen, and the thing one is to achieve, and
becoming enlightened--all of them--are empty of any natural existence. As
such the Buddha had no belief that he was taking up any truly existing
dharma at all from the Buddha Light Maker.

It is true that, at the time that the final prediction is made, the Buddha who is
predicted does not yet exist. And it is true that, by the time he becomes a
Buddha, the person who received the prediction no longer exists. In a nominal
sense though there is a single continuum, a single person, who exists from the
point of the prediction up to the point of enlightenment. There does exist a
general kind of "me," one which extends to the whole "me" of the past and the
future, where we do not divide out the separate me's of some specific points

in the past and future. It is with reference to this general "me" that the Buddha
grants his final prediction, and says "You will become such and such a
Buddha."

To give an example, it is true that the particular me's of specific past or future
lives, or else the particular me's of some point early on in your life, or later on
in your life, are not the "me" you are at this present moment in time.
Nonetheless it is allowable for us to say, of things that those me's have done
or are going to do, "I did that," or "I am going to do that." It's just the same
with the final prediction.

We also say things like "I am going to build a house," or "I am going to make
a hat, or some clothes, or a pair of shoes." Even though the house and the rest
have no existence at the moment that we say these things, we can speak
nonetheless of them, for we are thinking of them in the sense of something that
will come about in the future. And they will occur, if only nominally; but they
will not come forth through any nature of their own. If they could come about

through some nature of their own, then the house and so forth that we must
agree exist even as we speak of building or making them could never exist at
all. This is exactly the idea expressed in the Sutra Requested by Madrupa, where
it says:
Anything which arises from conditions does not arise;
There is no nature of arising in such a thing.
Anything dependent on conditions is explained as empty;
Anyone who understands emptiness is mindful.
You can also apply at this point all the reasonings presented earlier for
demonstrating how things have no true existence.

At some point you will gain a really correct understanding of how, despite the
fact that results do come from causes, they do not come from these causes
through any nature of their own. At that moment you will finally grasp the
way in which Middle Way philosophy describes how, despite the fact that
things are empty of any natural existence, they can still quite properly work
and function as they do. At that point too you will have discovered the
Middle Way itself, the path where the appearance of the normal world and
emptiness itself are inseparably married together.

Why is it so? Because, o Subhuti, there was a time when the
King of Kalingka was cutting off the larger limbs, and smaller
appendages, of my body. At that moment there came into my

mind no conception of a self, nor or of a sentient being, nor of
a living being, nor of a person--I had no conception at all. But
neither did I not have any conception.

For what reason is it so? Because long ago there was a time, o Subhuti, when
the king of Kalingka got the evil suspicion that I had engaged in relations
with his woman. And so he was cutting off the larger limbs, and smaller
appendages of my body. (The latter refers to the fingers and toes.)
At that moment I practiced patience, keeping my mind on an understanding
of the lack of true existence to each of the three elements to the act of patience.
As I focussed on the "me" which exists nominally, there came into my mind
no conception where I held any belief in some truly existing "me": and so I
had no conception of anything from a truly existing "self" up to a truly
existing "person."
At that moment I had no conception at all of any such conception that
something was existing truly. At the same time though it was neither as if I
had no other, nominal conceptions at all. What Subhuti is saying here is the
following. I did have the thought that I would have to keep my patience: I did
have the thought to take the pain on willingly, and not to be upset about the
harm being done to me. And I did have the kind of conception where I
reconfirmed my knowledge of how I had perceived that no existing object has
any true existence.

Why is it so? Suppose, o Subhuti, that at that moment any conception
of a self had come into my mind. Then the thought to harm someone
would have come into my mind as well.
The conception of some sentient being, and the conception of some
living being, and the conception of person, would have come into my
mind. And because of that, the thought to harm someone would have
come into my mind as well.

Here is the reason why it is so. Suppose that at that moment any conception
of a self, where I thought of "me" as existing in an ultimate way, had come
into my mind. Or suppose any of the other conceptions mentioned had come
into my mind. Then the thought to harm someone would have come into my
mind as well; but the fact is that it did not.

The Conqueror bespoke:
Suppose, o Subhuti, that some bodhisattva were to say, "I am

true.

Lord Buddha wishes to indicate that, in order for a person to reach the
enlightenment described above, he or she must first bring about a paradise in
which to achieve the enlightenment. Therefore the Conqueror says to Subhuti,

Suppose some bodhisattva were to say or think to
himself--while holding a belief in true existence, and referring to
ultimate existence--"I am working to bring about paradises."
This statement would not be spoken true.

Why is it so? Because the Ones Thus Gone have stated that
these paradises, these "paradises," these lands that are put there
do not even exist. And this is why we call them "paradise."

,RGYU MTSAN NI, 'TSANG RGYA BA'I GNAS KYI ZHING GI BKOD PA PHUN SUM TSOGS PA RNAMS NI RGYU RKYEN DU MA TSOGS NAS BYUNG BA SGYU MA LTA BU'I BKOD PA YIN GYI, DON DAM PAR BKOD PA DE DAG MED PAR DE BZHIN GSHEGS PAS GSUNGS PA'I PHYIR TE, 'ON KYANG MA BRTAG MA DPYAD PA'I BLO NGO NA YOD PAS THA SNYAD DU ZHING GI BKOD PA RNAMS ZHES BYA'O, , SANGS RGYAS KYI ZHING MA ZAD, SNOD BCUD KYI BKOD PA THAMS CAD KYANG CHA SHAS DU MA TSOGS PA LA BTAGS PA STE, KHANG PA LA SOGS PA BZHIN NO, , DE DAG THAMS CAD KYANG RIGS PAS RDUL PHRA RAB KYI BAR BSHIG NA CI YANG MA YIN PA'I BAR 'GYUR TE MTSON TZAM MO,
Why is this the case? The reason is that the Ones Thus Gone have stated that
these perfect paradises, these places where you achieve your enlightenment,
are put there like an illusion; that is, they occur because a great many causes
and conditions have come together. But lands which have been put there in
an ultimate sense, say the Buddhas, do not even exist. Since though they do
exist to that state of mind which performs no check or analysis, we can
nominally call them "paradise."
This fact refers not only to the paradise of a Buddha, but also to each and
every thing which has ever been put here: to both the world where beings live
and the beings who live in the world. All of these are simply a label put on
the collection of a number of parts: they are all the same as a house, for

example. And all of these are such that, should you break them down
mentally all the way to their tiniest atoms, you would reach the point where
they are nothing at all. (This is the briefest sketch of the meaning for you.)

Since this is so, o Subhuti, those bodhisattvas who are great
beings develop their wish without residing in these thoughts.
They develop their wish without residing in anything at all.
They develop their wish without residing even in visible form.
They develop their wish without residing even in sounds, or in
smells, or in tastes, or in things to touch, or in any object at all.

Since this is so, says Lord Buddha, bodhisattvas who are working to bring
about their paradise should develop their wish [for enlightenment] without
residing in any such state where they hold a belief in some true existence.
They should develop their wish without residing in any state where they
believe in the ultimate existence of anything at all. They should develop their
wish without residing in any state where they hold a belief in some true
existence of any object at all: visible form, or any of the rest.

O Subhuti, it is thus: Suppose, for example, that someone's

as the king of all mountains, Mt. Sumeru. What do you think,
o Subhuti? Would that person's body be large?
And Subhuti replied,
O Conqueror, such a body would be large. O you who have
Gone to Bliss, such a body would be large. And why so?
Because Those Gone Thus have stated that it could never be a
thing at all. And this is why we call it a "body." Because
Those Gone Thus have stated that it could never be a thing at
all, we call it a "large body."

Lord Buddha wishes to show that the above applies not only to outer things
such as paradises, but also to the beings who inhabit this world: to objects such
as the body of a person. He wishes to show that they too exist only because
conditions have come together, and not in an ultimate way. Therefore he asks
Subhuti,
Suppose some person's body were to grow to the size of the
king of mountains, Mt. Sumeru. What do you think? Would
that body be something large?
And Subhuti respectfully replies,
Such a body would be large. Those who have Gone Thus
though have stated that this same body exists only as a term
applied to the heaps, to some collection of a great many parts.
It could never be a thing at all which existed in essence; that is,
it could never be something which did not depend on its parts,
say they. And this is why we can call such a body "large," in
the sense that words are used in the everyday world.
Here a large body is just a representative example; we are meant to apply this
reasoning to all physical objects, large or small. The entire statement here in
the sutra is aimed at showing us how to meditate upon the fact that each and
every detail of the world and the beings who inhabit it are all empty of any
natural existence.

And I tell you further, o Subhuti: any place where this sutra is
taught thereby becomes a place worthy of the offerings of the
entire world, with its gods, and men, and demigods. It

becomes a place which is worthy of their prostrations, and
worthy of their circumambulations. That place becomes
something like a stupa.

Furthermore, any place where this sutra is taught thereby becomes a place
worthy of the offerings, and the prostrations, and the circumambulations of
all the living beings in the entire world, with its gods, and men, and
demigods. This point recalls the line in the Ornament of Realizations where it
talks about "enlightenment and none other than a stupa." This refers to a fact
mentioned in the root sutra--in the Mother, in its more extensive, medium,
and shorter versions, as well as in the commentaries. Here it says that any
place where a bodhisattva on the path of habituation stays thereby becomes a
place like a stupa, a place that should be revered by other people. The
reference here in this case is mainly to any place where there resides a person
who has managed to develop the whole point of this text--that is, an
extraordinary form of actual perfection of wisdom--within the stream of his
mind. Previously in the sutra a section similar to this one appears, but each
instance applies to a different case.

Here in a statement over and above the one before, Lord Buddha says,
O Subhuti, consider any son or daughter of noble family who
takes up this sutra, who holds it in their hands, and so on--any
living being who does these things and then puts the meaning of
the sutra into practice. It is entirely possible that such a person
could experience some pain, that they could suffer, and suffer
intensely, through various kinds of illness, or conflict with
others, or being criticized, or chained, or beaten, or anything of
the like. It could happen, but it would be no great problem,
because. . .

Why is it so? Because, o Subhuti, such beings are purifying
non-virtuous karma from the entire string of their previous
lives, karma that would have taken them to the three lower
realms. As they purify this karma, it causes them to suffer here
in this life. As such they will succeed in cleaning away the
karma of these non-virtuous deeds of their previous lifetimes,
and they will as well achieve the enlightenment of a Buddha.

For what reason is it so? Because such beings are purifying great non-
virtuous karma that they have committed both in this life and in their lifetimes
past--karma so serious that it would normally have taken them to the three
lower realms. As such, the results of all these deeds are ripening here in this
very life. Thus one is suffering pain, and by force of this suffering he or she
is "cleaning away"--that is, purifying--all of this non-virtuous karma. As
such, one will quickly achieve the enlightenment of a Buddha.

The force of an antidote action consisting of making great efforts in the
perfection of wisdom is destroying the grasping to some self-existence, the very
root of all non-virtuous deeds. This is why the text goes on to say that one
will achieve freedom and the state of omniscience. And since the text does say
this, then needless to say one could destroy the karma that is leading you to
a birth in the lower realms. The way in which this works is explained in texts
such as the Blaze of Reasoning and others. As the Sutra of the Great Liberation
says as well,
Even though one may have the bad karma
To take his birth in the three lower realms,
A simple headache will clean it away.
Suppose for example that a seed is planted, but is then deprived completely
of water, or fertilizer, or warmth, or the rest. Then it would never sprout.
Here the case is the same. If you are able to eliminate grasping to some self-
nature, then none of the karmas you have collected, regardless of how many
there are, can ever ripen forth. This is because their companion, the mental
afflictions, are absent. As the Commentary on Valid Perception states,
No further karmas can ever project their results
In one who has gone beyond the desire for existence;
This is because the conditions have all been finished.

Dharma? How are we to consider it?
And the Conqueror bespoke the following to the junior monk Subhuti:
O Subhuti, this particular kind of Dharma is known as the
"perfection of wisdom," and that is how you should consider it.

Then Subhuti asks, "What is the name of this text?" In reply the Conqueror
states, "Its name is the 'perfection of wisdom,'" and "that is how you should
consider it to be named." The subject matter selected by the Teacher, the
subject expressed by the text, is the perfection of wisdom in its actual form.
The point here then is that the Teacher has named the text that expresses this
subject by using the name of the subject it expresses. Here the name of the
perfection of wisdom is meant to represent all the other perfections as well.

Why is it so? Because, o Subhuti, that same perfection of
wisdom spoken by the Ones Thus Gone is a perfection of
wisdom that doesn't even exist. And this is why we call it the
"perfection of wisdom."

That same perfection of wisdom spoken by the Ones Thus Gone to be the
"perfection of wisdom" is a perfection of wisdom that doesn't even exist as
a perfection of wisdom in an ultimate sense. And this is why we can, in a
nominal sense, label it the "perfection of wisdom." All these kinds of
explanations, where they state that things do not exist ultimately but do exist
nominally, illustrate the path of the middle way, wherein the two truths are
accepted as an inseparable unity, which functions to prevent completely the
two extremes. They illustrate, in short, how the quality of being empty of any
natural existence, and the quality of existing nominally, coexist with each other
as simultaneous attributes of any single object.
Here is a bit on the literal meaning of the expression "perfection," or "gone to
the other side." This term connotes either that thing which takes you to the
other side of the ocean of cyclic life, or else the state of having already reached
that other side. Taken the former way, the expression refers the perfection of
wisdom as it exists on the paths of those who are still learning [that is, non-
Buddhas]. Taken the latter way, it refers to the perfection of wisdom which
exists at the level of a Buddha, and is equivalent to the knowledge of all
objects.
If we go beyond its strictest sense, there are many different usages of the term
"perfection of wisdom": it can refer to the "natural," or the "textual," or the
"path," or the "resulting" perfection of wisdom. It's important to be able to
distinguish between all these, but it would be beyond the scope of this
commentary for me to discuss them here. To put it briefly, what was spoken
of as the "perfection of wisdom" refers to that knowledge which is imbued

with the wish to attain enlightenment, and which perceives emptiness. It is
this same perfection of wisdom which acts as an extraordinary kind of
method for taking the first five perfections--those of giving and the rest--and
leading them up to the point of enlightenment. I will speak further of this
later.

O Subhuti, what do you think? Is there any dharma at all
which the Ones Thus Gone ever speak?
And Subhuti respectfully replied,
O Conqueror, none of the dharmas ever spoken by the Ones
Thus Gone even exist.

In the part before this one, Lord Buddha mentioned "the perfection of wisdom
spoken by the Ones Thus Gone," and explained how it could be the perfection
of wisdom. Someone might think to themselves, "Are there though any other
dharmas which were spoken by the Ones Thus Gone, and which do exist in an
ultimate sense?"
In order to answer this question with an emphatic "No!" the Buddha poses a
question to Subhuti: "Is there any such dharma at all?"

In reply, Subhuti offers up the following answer: "None of the dharmas ever
spoken by the Ones Thus Gone even exist, at least in an ultimate sense." The
point here is very similar to the one before, where it said that the teaching of
the dharma by the Ones Thus Gone did not even exist.

XVIII. A Unique Teaching of the "Implication" School
The fifth and final section in our explanation of correct view concerns a unique
teaching followed by the "Implication" group of the Middle Way school. This
instruction is contained in the following verse of the root text.
(13)
In addition, the appearance prevents the existence extreme;
Emptiness that of non-existence, and if
You see how emptiness shows in cause and effect
You'll never be stolen off by extreme views.

THAL 'GYUR BA MIN PA TSOS SNANG BAS MED MTHA' DANG , STONG PAS YOD MTHA' SEL BAR BZHED KYANG ,
Now all the schools except for the members of the "Implication" group hold
that an understanding of the appearance of things prevents you from falling
into what we call the "extreme of thinking things do not exist," while an
understanding of emptiness prevents you from falling into what is known as
the "extreme of thinking things do exist."

The position of the Implication group though is that no particular object you
can choose has any true existence, aside from merely appearing this way; and
understanding this prevents you from going to the extreme of thinking things
exist--that is, exist in an ultimate way. And because this mere appearance itself
cannot exist on its own, an understanding of emptiness prevents your falling
into the extreme of thinking things do not exist--that is, do not exist in a
conventional way.

Once something is interdependent there is no possibility for it to be anything
else but something which does not exist naturally--something which cannot
stand on its own. This is because it must then occur in dependence on the
collection of parts which serve as the basis that receives our label. Look at the
example of some feeble old man, unable to rise from his chair by himself, who
must seek some other support to get up--he cannot stand on his own. Here
it's a similar case: no object can stand on its own, no object can exist just
naturally, so long as it must depend on any other factor.

LAN BYED,
Generally speaking, there are a great number of logical proofs that can be used
when you want to establish the meaning of no self-nature. There is one
though which is like the king of them all, and this is it: the "proof through
interdependence." Let's say we put forth this argument to someone, and we
say:
Consider a sprout.
It cannot exist truly,
For it is interdependent.
Members of certain non-Buddhist schools will answer "I disagree with your
reason," which is to say, "Sprouts are not interdependent." This they must say
because they believe that every object in the universe is a manifestation of
some primeval One.

The majority of the earlier Tibetan Buddhists fell into the extreme that we call
"thinking things have stopped," for they would say that if something did not
exist truly it could not exist at all. The schools from the Mind-Only on down,
the group of schools known collectively as the "Functionalists," all fall into the
extreme of "thinking things are permanent," for they cannot explain
interdependence if they accept that nothing exists naturally. Members of the
"Independent" group within the Middle Way school accept the idea of
interdependence, but do not agree that if something is interdependent it cannot
"exist by definition." This too is tantamount to the extreme of thinking things
are permanent.

SMRA BA SOGS KYI 'KHRUL GZHI YOD MED BZHI PO 'DI MA PHYED PA'I SKYON YIN,
The real sages of the Middle Way school make a fourfold distinction: they say
that nothing exists naturally, but not that nothing exists at all; everything exists
merely by convention, but everything exists without existing naturally. The
point of error for the Functionalists and those other schools is their failure to
distinguish between these four: two kinds of "nothing exists" and two kinds of
"everything exists."

According to the Implication system, both extremes--thinking things are
permanent and thinking things have stopped--can be prevented with a single
logical statement: "It cannot exist truly, because it is interdependent." The first
part of the statement keeps us from the extreme of thinking things are
permanent; the second, from the extreme of thinking things have stopped.

My own precious teacher, Choney Lama, was always saying that both parts of
the statement each prevent both of the extremes--permanence and stopping. He
would explain this as follows: the literal sense of the statement's first part, "It
cannot exist truly," serves to prevent the extreme of thinking things are
permanent. The implication of saying that something cannot exist "truly"
though is to say that, more generally, it is not non-existent; this then disallows
the extreme of thinking that things have stopped. And this description, he
would say, was enough for us to figure out for ourselves the process for the
second part of the statement: "...because it is interdependent."

DES NA DPAL LDAN ZLA BAS KYANG , DE PHYIR RTEN 'BYUNG RIGS PA 'DI YIS NI, , LTA NGAN DRA BA MTHA' DAG GCOD PAR BYED, , CES GSUNGS PA RED,
With this understanding we can see why the glorious Chandrakirti stated:
Therefore this proof employing interdependence
Cuts the net of every mistaken view.

So we've shown that no object in the universe exists truly; we've given
"because it's interdependent" as our reason for saying so; and we've
demonstrated that these two facts can prevent one from falling into either
extreme. This too is why we see statements like the following, from Root
Wisdom:
Everything is right for any thing
For which the state of emptiness is right.
Or the well-known sutra lines:
Form is emptiness,
Emptiness form.

MDO LAS KYANG , GZUGS STONG PA'O, , STONG PA NYID GZUGS SO, , ZHES SOGS GSUNGS, 'DI YANG RTEN 'BYUNG STONG PA DANG , STONG PA RTEN 'BYUNG GI DON DU GSUNGS PA YIN, DE BZHIN DU NGA STONG PA'O, , STONG PA NYID NGA'O, , ZHES SBYAR NA GO BDE BAR 
These last lines by the way are stated to show that interdependence is itself
empty, and emptiness itself interdependent. It helps your understanding of
this point if you take the same pattern and read it as

I am emptiness,
Emptiness me.

'DUG,MDOR BSDU NA, RANG BZHIN GYIS STONG PA LA RGYU 'BRAS THAMS CAD 'THAD, MTHA' GNYIS LA MA LHUNG BA ZHIG BYUNG NA LTA BA'I GOL SA GZHAN MI 'BYUNG GSUNGS,
In short, concluded our Lama, the laws of cause and effect are all totally
proper for any entity which is empty of any natural existence. If you can just
keep yourself from falling into the two extremes, you will make no great other
blunders in your effort to develop correct view.

It is thus. Any living beings who receive an explanation of this
sutra and who are not made afraid, and are not frightened, and
who do not become frightened, are truly wondrous.

Here is the reason. In future days, certain living beings will receive, they will
listen to, an explanation of the meaning of the words of this sutra. And yet
they will not be made afraid, and they will not be frightened, and they will
not become extremely frightened, by any such thought as: "If this is so, and
if nothing at all exists in a true way, then all the ways in which things like
karma and its consequences work cannot be right, and so really nothing at all
can work."
Rather they will find a greater belief, an even greater faith, in all these objects.
And beings like this will be truly wondrous.
If things did exist in a true way, then it would be improper to say that they
ever changed. And then it would be improper, it would never be right, to
describe all the workings of things like karma and its consequences.
The way in which all things work, and nirvana itself, and everything else are
all quite proper. And none of these objects has any true existence, none of
them has any nature of their own. How all this can be is described by Lord
Tsongkapa in his Praise from Interdependence:
Reaching the state of nirvana could never occur,
And elaborations too could never be stopped,
If objects had any nature of their own, because
A nature could not be stopped, You stated.
He also says,
Since things are empty of any nature
And the way things work is right,
There is no contradiction between them.
Those who see things the opposite
Think nothing can work with emptiness...

Why is it so? Because, o Subhuti, the One Thus Gone now speaks to
you the holy perfection of wisdom; and the holy perfection which the
One Thus Gone now speaks to you is the same perfection of wisdom
which Conquering Buddhas beyond any number to count have
spoken as well. And this is why we can call it the "holy perfection
of wisdom."

Here is the reason why it will be so wondrous. The holy, or highest,
perfection of wisdom--a work which teaches how no object exists through any
nature of its own--is now being spoken to you by myself, by the One Thus
Gone. And this is the same perfection of wisdom which has been spoken
in the past by Conquering Buddhas who are beyond any number to count.
Lord Buddha makes this statement because he wants his listeners to consider
what he has just said above as something authoritative. What he has just said,
remember, is that nothing involved with cause and effect has any nature of its
own. And this reason is why we can call it the "holy perfection of wisdom."

Reading Eleven: The Verse of Impermanence and Emptiness
The following selections are taken from Sunlight on the Path to Freedom, written
by Choney Lama Drakpa Shedrup (1675-1748) of Sera Mey Tibetan Monastery. The
original root text of the sutra by Lord Buddha is marked with an ornament in the
Tibetan and bold in the English.

,RMI LAM GLOG DANG SPRIN LTA BU,

An obstruction of the eye,
A lamp, an illusion,
The dew, or a bubble;
A dream, or lightning,
Or else a cloud.

Next comes a concluding summary, which shows how all things brought
about by causes are empty of any nature of their own, and are also
impermanent. All this is contained in the verse about the "star, an obstruction
of the eye, a lamp," and the rest.
We could take for example the five heaps--physical form and the rest--or any
such objects. All these can be described in the following metaphors.

SKAR MA RNAMS NI MTSAN MOR SNANG ZHING , NYIN MOR MI SNANG BA DE BZHIN DU PHUNG SOGS KYI 'DUS BYAS RNAMS NI MA RIG PA'I MUN PA YOD NA DON DAM PAR STONG GI, BDEN MED RTOGS PA'I YE SHES KYI NYI MA SHAR BA NA DON DAM PAR MI SNANG BAS SKAR MA BZHIN DU BLTA'O,
Stars appear at night, and then by day they no longer appear. The parts to a
person and other things brought about by causes are just the same. If a
person's mind is full of the darkness of ignorance, then they appear to exist in
an ultimate sense. [Correcting an error in Tibetan text, stong for snang.]
Suppose though that the sun rises--the sun of the wisdom which perceives
that nothing exists truly. Then these objects no longer appear in an ultimate
sense. As such we should see these things as being like a star.

,RDUL SOGS RAB RIB KYIS MIG BSGRIBS PA'I TSE DON JI LTA BA BZHIN DU MI SNANG BAR GZHAN DU MTHONG BA LTAR MA RIG PA'I RAB RIB KYIS BLO MIG BSGRIBS PA'I NGOR 'DUS BYAS RNAMS KYANG DON GZHAN DU SNANG NGO ,
Suppose your eyes are blocked by some obstruction in them--by particles of
dust or something of the like. The thing that you're trying to look at then
doesn't look the way it really is; rather, you see it some other way. It's just the
same with the eye of the mind when it's blocked by the obstruction of
ignorance. Things brought about by causes then appear to this mind as
something other than what they are.

The flame of a butter lamp, supported by a thin plant wick, flares and then
quickly dies out. Caused things, each supported their various causes and
conditions, also go through a continuous process of rising and quickly dying
out.

,SGYU MA NI DON GZHAN DU SNANG BA LTAR 'DUS BYAS RNAMS NI BLO 'KHRUL BA'I NGOR BDEN PAR SNANG NGO ,
An illusion is something that looks different than what is actually there.
Things brought about by causes also appear to exist truly, to a mistaken state
of mind.

,ZIL MA NI MYUR DU 'JIG PA LTAR 'DUS BYAS RNAMS NI RANG GI DUS GNYIS PAR MI SDOD PAR MYUR DU 'JIG GO,
Dew vanishes quickly; things with causes are the same--they die away
speedily, without lasting even into the second instant of their existence.

,CHU BUR NI CHU 'KHRUGS PA SOGS LAS GLO BUR DU 'BYUNG ZHING 'JIG PA LTAR 'DUS BYAS RNAMS NI RKYEN TSOGS NA GLO BUR DU 'BYUNG ZHING 'JIG GO,
Bubbles pop up at random, because some water is stirred up or something of
the like, and then they burst and disappear just as suddenly. Caused things
work the same way: when the various conditions all come together, they pop
up suddenly, and then they die out just as suddenly.

,RMI LAM NI GNYID KYIS BSLAD PA'I TSE 'KHRUL SNANG YIN PA LTAR 'DUS BYAS RNAMS NI MA RIG PAS BSLAD PA'I NGOR BDEN SNANG DU 'CHAR RO,
Dreams are an example of a misperception, which is due to the affects of sleep
on the mind. Things brought about by causes as well are misapprehended,
they seem to exist truly, to the mind which is affected by ignorance.

,GLOG NI MYUR DU 'BYUNG ZHING 'JIG PA LTAR 'DUS BYAS RNAMS NI RKYEN TSOGS NA MYUR DU 'BYUNG ZHING 'JIG GO,
Lightning flashes and dies out quickly. Caused things too rise and die out
quickly, depending on the conditions that assemble to bring them about.

Clouds are something that gather and fade in the sky, depending on the
wishes of the serpent-beings and such. Things brought about by causes are the
same; depending on the influence of karma which is either communal or not,
they rise or die out.
Each of the metaphors above is also meant to represent how no object brought
about by causes has any true existence.

entire group. A more restricted application is quoted from sutra by Master
Nagarjuna:
The physical form is like a bubble that forms,
And the feelings resemble the froth of a wave;
Discrimination is just a mirage,
And the other factors like empty cane;
Awareness is similar to an illusion--
Thus did the Cousin of the Sun speak.

Master Kamalashila relates the final three metaphors to the three times; this is
a little different from the explanation here, but the two are in no way
contradictory.

To put it briefly, Lord Buddha is telling us that we should "See that each and
every thing brought about by causes is impermanent, and is empty of any
nature of its own, all just like the nine examples given above." We should also
consider these lines as indicating both the lack of self to the person, and the
lack of self to phenomena.
