Their roar of arrogance covers the world,
And they strut with imagined self-importance:
Source of Happiness, Rider on the Cloud,
Child of the Golden Womb, Lord of Those
Who Have No Body, Belly String, and the rest.
But the minute they lay their eyes on your form
It does to them what the sun does to a firefly,
And they throw themselves at your feet,
Touching them with their lovely crowns.
I bow down to you, Lord of the Able,
God of all the gods.

These are points that many with no little
Mass of spiritual qualities--
Filled with realizations won
With much learning of great holy books
And much pain spent in the ways
Of reaching conclusions with reason--
Have tried their best, but nonetheless
Have failed to realize.
Here though I will explain them,
With thoughts of purest love,
For I have seen them perfectly
Through the kindness of my Lama,
The Protector, the Gentle One.

Please lend your ear then, those
Who hope to become themselves

With deep insights that realize
The real nature revealed
In the teachings of the Buddha.

,DE DAG THUGS RJE MNGA' BAS THABS TSUL DANG ,
,RIGS PA BRGYA DAG GIS NI 'DZUD PAR MDZAD,
Now the Sutra Requested by the Realized Being Rashtrapala says,
Different beings must wander here
Because they have no knowledge
Of the ways of emptiness,
Of peace, and of things that never began.
Those with compassion use skillful means
And millions of different reasonings
To bring them into it.

,CES CHOS RNAMS KYI DE BZHIN NYID NI SHIN TU RTOGS PAR DKA' BA DANG , MA RTOGS NA 'KHOR BA LAS MI GROL BAR GZIGS NAS THUGS RJE CAN GYI STON PAS THABS KYI TSUL DANG RIGS PA'I SGO DU MA ZHIG GIS DE KHONG DU CHUD BA LA 'DZUD PAR GSUNGS SO, ,
What these lines are saying is that the real nature of all things is something
which is extremely difficult to perceive; and that if one fails to perceive it, one
can never be freed from the circle of suffering. Our compassionate Teacher has

seen these things clearly, and thus undertakes to bring beings on to a grasp of
this real nature, using a great many skillful means, and a great many different
types of reasoning.

DE'I PHYIR RNAM DPYOD DANG LDAN PA DAG GIS DE NYID JI LTAR YIN KHONG DU CHUD PA'I THABS LA 'BAD DGOS LA DE YANG RGYAL BA'I GSUNG RAB KYI DRANG BA DANG NGES PA'I DON RNAM PAR PHYED PA LA RAG LAS SHING ,
For this reason, those with the capacity of insight should make great efforts in
the various means of coming to a grasp of just what the real nature of things
is. This, in turn, depends upon the ability to distinguish between what is
figurative and what is literal among that highest of all spoken words--the
speech of the victorious Buddhas.

DE GNYIS RNAM PAR 'BYED PA YANG 'DI NI DRANG BA'I DON NO 'DI NI NGES PA'I DON NO ZHES GSUNGS PA'I LUNG TZAM GYIS NUS PA MA YIN TE, GZHAN DU NA SHING RTA CHEN PO DAG GIS DRANG NGES 'BYED BA'I DGONGS 'GREL BRTZAMS PA DON MED PAR 'GYUR BA'I PHYIR DANG , GSUNG RAB LAS DRANG NGES KYI 'JOG TSUL MI MTHUN PA DU MA GSUNGS PA'I PHYIR DANG ,
The distinction between these two is not something that words themselves
have the power to draw, saying "This part is figurative, and this part is literal."
Otherwise it would have been a useless exercise for the great innovators to
compose commentaries exploring the true intent of the teachings, undertaking
to make distinctions between what was figurative and what was literal.
Neither would there have been spoken, in that highest of spoken words itself,
so many conflicting versions of how we decide what is figurative and what is
literal.

'DI NI 'DI'O ZHES GSUNGS PA TZAM GYI LUNG GIS DE LTAR GZHAG PAR NI MI NUS LA DE'I TSE SPYI LA DE LTAR MA KHYAB PA NA BYE BRAG DRANG NGES LA YANG 'DI 'DI'O ZHES GSUNGS PA TZAM GYIS KYANG SGRUB PAR MI NUS PA'I PHYIR RO, ,
And look finally at the fact that--even if a scripture does say that "This is this
way, and that is that way"--this still does not enable us to decide that it really
is. If it is thus the case, throughout the teachings in general, that we cannot
draw any unquestionable conclusions from such statements, then why should
it be true--in this more particular case--that we can conclusively establish the
distinction between the figurative and the literal from any particular reference
that says, "This is the one, and this the other"?

DE'I PHYIR GSUNG RAB KYI DRANG NGES 'BYED PAR LUNG BSTAN PA'I SHING RTA CHEN PO DAG GIS DRANG NGES KYI DGONGS PA BKRAL ZHING DE YANG NGES DON GYI GSUNG RAB KYI DON GZHAN DU 'DREN PA LA GNOD BYED DANG , GZHAN DU DRANG DU MI RUNG BAR DON DER NGES PA'I SGRUB BYED KYI RIGS PAS LEGS PAR GTAN LA PHAB PA ZHIG GI RJES SU 'BRANGS NAS DGONGS PA 'TSOL DGOS PAS MTHAR GTUGS NA DRI MA MED PA'I RIGS PA NYID KYIS DBYE DGOS TE,
Therefore we must go about our search for the true intent of the teachings by
following the two great innovators--those who the scriptures foretold would
be able to draw the distinction between the figurative and the literal. It is they
who have unravelled for us the idea behind the figurative and the literal; it is
they who have used true reasoning to establish, in a perfect way, those
teachings which are literal--by finding proofs against any attempt to interpret
them in some other light; and proofs in support of their being something
literal, not something figurative, not something we could say refers to
something else. In the end, we must learn to make this distinction through
immaculate reasoning alone.

RIGS PA DANG 'GAL BA'I GRUB MTHA' KHAS LEN NA SMRA BA PO TSAD MA'I SKYES BUR MI RUNG BA'I PHYIR DANG , DNGOS PO'I DE KHO NA NYID KYANG 'THAD PAS SGRUB PA'I RIGS PA'I SGRUB BYED DANG LDAN PA'I PHYIR RO, ,
And this is true because anyone who espouses some philosophical system that
contradicts reason could never be called a perfectly credible person; and
because the very nature of things is, moreover, something that must be
established by reason grounded in accurate perception.

,BSREGS BCAD BRDAR BA'I GSER BZHIN DU,
,LEGS PAR BRTAGS LA NGA YI BKA',
,BLANG BAR BYA YI GUS PHYIR MIN, ,
ZHES GSUNGS SO, ,
Lord Buddha himself saw the truth of this highest form of meaning, and thus
spoke the following:
Whether you are a monk or some other thinker,
You must accept my words only after you've finished
A careful examination of them, testing them like gold--
In the fire, by cutting, and using the touchstone too.

DE LTAR NA DRANG NGES 'BYED PA LA GNYIS, MDO SDE DGONGS 'GREL LA BRTEN PA'I PHYOGS DANG , BLO GROS MI ZAD PAS BSTAN PA LA BRTEN PA'I PHYOGS SO, ,
And so it is that we proceed, in our task of distinguishing between the
figurative and the literal, in two steps, presenting first the ideas of the side that
uses the Commentary on the True Intent of the Sutras to help draw this
distinction, and secondly the ideas of the side that uses the Sutra Taught at the
Request of Never-Ending Wisdom to do so.

DANG PO LA GNYIS, MDO SDE NAS JI LTAR GSUNGS PA DGOD PA DANG , DE'I DON JI LTAR BKRAL BA'I TSUL LO, ,
The first step has two parts of its own: setting forth what the sutra says, and
showing how its meaning is commented upon.

DANG PO LA BZHI, MDO SDE LA 'GAL SPONG GI DRI BA, 'GAL BA DE SPONG BA'I LAN, NGO BO 
NYID GSUM GYI NGO BO NGOS GZUNG BA, DE DAG GIS GRUB PA'I DON ZHUS PA'O, ,
The first of these parts has four further divisions: a question meant to clarify
apparent contradictions in the sutras; an answer that clarifies these apparent
contradictions; an identification of the nature of the three real natures; and a
statement, offered by the bodhisattva, of the conclusion reached by these
points.

DANG PO NI DGONGS 'GREL LAS, BCOM LDAN 'DAS KYIS RNAM GRANGS DU MAR PHUNG PO RNAMS KYI RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYANG BKA' STZAL, SKYE BA'I MTSAN NYID DANG , 'JIG PA'I MTSAN NYID DANG , SPANG BA DANG YONGS SU SHES PA YANG BKA' STZAL,
Here is the first. We find the following in the Commentary on the True Intent:
O Conqueror, you have in many of your presentations made
statements that the heaps have some definitive characteristics of
their own. You have also spoken of their characteristic of
beginning, and their characteristic of being destroyed, and of
eliminating and comprehending.

PHUNG PO RNAMS KYI JI LTA BA DE BZHIN DU SKYE MCHED RNAMS DANG RTEN CING 'BREL PAR 'BYUNG BA DANG ZAS RNAMS KYI BAR YANG BKA' STZAL,
You also stated that the way in which the heaps exist is the same
for the doors of sense, and for things that occur through
interdependence, and for everything up to the different kinds of
sustenance.

DE BZHIN DU SBYAR NAS BDEN PA RNAMS KYI RANG GI MTSAN NYID DANG YONGS SU SHES PA DANG SPANG BA DANG MNGON DU BGYI BA DANG BSGOM PA DANG KHAMS RNAMS KYI RANG GI MTSAN NYID DANG KHAMS SNA TSOGS PA DANG KHAMS DU MA DANG SPANG BA DANG YONGS SU SHES PA DANG ,
The question continues in the same pattern through the truths:
. . .And you stated that these truths were something that had
definitive characteristics of their own, and were something which

we should comprehend, and something we should eliminate, and
something to bring about, and something to practice. And then
you spoke of the categories as having some definitive
characteristics of their own, and so too did you speak of the
various categories, and the many categories, and of eliminating
and comprehending.

BYANG PHYOGS SO BDUN GYI RANG GI MTSAN NYID DANG MI MTHUN PA DANG GNYEN PO DANG MA SKYES PA SKYE BA DANG SKYES PA GNAS PA DANG MI BSKYUD PA DANG SLAR ZHING 'BYUNG BA DANG 'PHEL ZHING YANGS PA NYID KYANG BKA' STZAL LA,
The question turns too through the different groups among the 37 qualities of
enlightenment:
. . .You spoke too of these qualities as having some definitive
characteristics of their own, and you spoke of their nature of
being inconsistent, and of being an antidote, and of the growth
of what has not grown, and of the staying of what has grown,
and of there being no separation, and of coming back, and of
increasing, and of spreading.

And you said, O Conqueror, that no existing thing could have
any nature of its own; you said that no existing thing ever began,
or stopped; you said that they were, from the very beginning, in
a state of peace; you said that they were, by nature, something
that was completely beyond all grief.

BCOM LDAN 'DAS KYIS CI LA DGONGS NAS CHOS THAMS CAD NGO BO NYID MA MCHIS PA CHOS THAMS CAD MA SKYES PA MA 'GAGS PA BZOD MA NAS ZHI BA RANG BZHIN GYIS YONGS SU MYA NGAN LAS 'DAS PA ZHES BKA' STZAL SNYAM BGYID LAGS TE,
What was it, O Conquering One, that you were truly thinking of
when you said that no existing thing could have any nature of its
own, and said that no existing thing ever began, or stopped;
when you said that they were, from the very beginning, in a state
of peace; when you said that they were, by nature, something
that was completely beyond all grief?

BCOM LDAN 'DAS KYIS CI LA DGONGS NAS CHOS THAMS CAD NGO BO NYID MA MCHIS PA CHOS THAMS CAD MA SKYES PA MA 'GAGS PA GZOD MA NAS ZHI BA RANG BZHIN GYIS YONGS SU MYA NGAN LAS 'DAS PA ZHES KYANG BKA' STZAL BA'I DON DE NYID BCOM LDAN 'DAS LA BDAG YONGS SU ZHU LAGS SO, , ZHES GSUNGS SO, ,
And so this is what I ask of you, O Conquering One: was it really
that which the Conqueror had in mind when you said that no
existing thing could have any nature of its own, and said that no
existing thing ever began, or stopped; when you said that they
were, from the very beginning, in a state of peace; when you said
that they were, by nature, something that was completely beyond
all grief?

'DIS NI MDO SDE KHA CIG TU CHOS THAMS CAD NGO BO NYID MED PA SOGS SU GSUNGS PA DANG , KHA CIG TU PHUNG PO LA SOGS PA'I RANG GI MTSAN NYID LA SOGS PA YOD PAR GSUNGS PA GNYIS SGRA SOR BZHAG NA 'GAL NA'ANG 'GAL BA MED DGOS PAS CI LA DGONGS NAS NGO BO NYID MED PA SOGS SU GSUNGS ZHES DRIS TE, DES NI RANG GI MTSAN NYID YOD PA SOGS SU GSUNGS PA YANG CI LA DGONGS NAS GSUNGS PA DON GYIS ZHUS SO, ,
The point of this question is as follows. In some sutras, Lord Buddha said that
no existing thing had any nature of its own, and so on. In other sutras though
he said that the heaps and so on did have their own definitive characteristics,
and so on. The bodhisattva knows that--if we take these two types of
statements on face value--then they contradict each other; but that it cannot

be the case that they do. Therefore he is asking Lord Buddha what he really
had in mind when he said that no existing thing could have any nature of its
own, and so on. The bodhisattva is, by implication, asking just what Lord
Buddha meant by phrases such as "existing by definition" and the like.

'DIR RANG GI MTSAN NYID CES PA RGYA NAG GI 'GREL CHEN SOGS LAS THUN MONG MA YIN PA'I MTSAN NYID LA BSHAD PA NI RIGS PA MA YIN TE, MDO NYID LAS KUN BRTAGS KYI SKABS SU RANG GI MTSAN NYID GYIS GRUB PA LA GSAL BAR GSUNGS PA'I PHYIR DANG , KUN BRTAGS LA'ANG THUN MONG MA YIN PA'I MTSON BYED YOD PAS MTSAN NYID NGO BO NYID MED PA KUN BRTAGS LA BSHAD DU MI RUNG BA'I SKYON DU 'GYUR BA'I PHYIR RO, ,
The term here "definitive characteristic" or "definition" [in "having definitive
characteristics" or "existing by definition"] has been explained in the great
Chinese commentary and elsewhere as referring to the particular verbal
definition of a thing. This idea though is incorrect, since--for one thing--the
sutra itself clearly refers to the idea of existing by definition in the parts where
it talks about constructs. Furthermore, even constructs have their own
particular verbal descriptions which are used to define them; so if this were the
meaning of "definition" here then there would be a problem if we went on to
describe them as not having any nature or definitive characteristics of their
own.

KHAMS SNA TSOGS PA DANG DU MA LA 'GREL PA RNAMS KYIS GZHAN DU BSHAD KYANG 'OG NAS 'BYUNG BA'I MDO DANG SBYAR NA KHAMS BCO BRGYAD DANG KHAMS DRUG LA BYA'O, , MI BSKYUD PA NI MI BRJED PA'O, ,
Various commentaries have described the phrases "various categories" and
"many categories" otherwise, but if we refer down to what comes later in the
sutra itself then we should take them to mean the eighteen categories and the
six categories, respectively. The phrase "being no separation" refers to not
losing something.

The second division, an answer that clarifies apparent contradictions in the
sutras, has two further sections of its own: an explanation of just what "lack of
a self nature" it was that Lord Buddha had in mind when he said that nothing
had any nature of its own; and what it was that he had in mind when he said
"nothing grows" and the like.
We cover the first section in three steps: a brief presentation, an expanded
explanation, and illustrations for the points covered. Here is the first.

Lord Buddha replies by saying that, when he stated that nothing had any
nature of its own, he was actually referring to all three lacks of a self nature;
as the True Intent of the Sutras itself reads,
Listen, Paramarta Samudgata. When I said that no existing object
at all had any nature of its own, what I was referring to was
three different lacks of a self nature that existing things exhibit.
These three are the quality of lacking any definitive nature, the
quality of lacking any nature of growing, and the quality of
lacking any nature of being ultimate.

The Abbreviation also says:
What was it that the Conqueror had in mind when he said that
no existing thing had any nature of its own? I will tell you; he
spoke of that to disciples of varying capacities, and what he had
in mind was the three different kinds of a lack of self-nature. . .

The Thirty Verses says as well:
There are three different forms of this self-nature;
And what Lord Buddha had in mind
When he said that no existing object
Had any nature of its own
Was that there were on the other hand
Three different lacks of a self-nature too.
Let us consider, in light of these different references, the explanation by certain
people that--when Lord Buddha stated, in sutras such as those on the
perfection of wisdom, that no existing object had any nature of its own--he
was thinking only of every existing object belonging to the deceptive type, and
not of those belonging to the ultimate type. Anyone who holds this position
thus contradicts both the Commentary on the True Intent and the classics of
Master Asanga and his brother; they have moreover left behind them the
system followed by the realized father and his spiritual son [the realized being
Nagarjuna, and Master Aryadeva], and all the others as well.

When the bodhisattva asks Lord Buddha what he had in mind when he said
that objects had no nature of their own, he is really asking two different things:
what Lord Buddha meant by the expression "no-self-nature," and how it is that
nothing has any such nature. The answer by Lord Buddha addresses both of
these points as well, one after the other. We begin by explaining the first.

Consider all the infinite variety of objects that Lord Buddha was referring to
when he said that none of the existing things from physical matter up to the
omniscience of an enlightened being had any nature or quality of its own.
Lord Buddha grouped them into three different types of things with no nature
of their own, for two reasons: first because they are all subsumed by these
three types of things with no nature of their own, and secondly because it
would then be easier to teach disciples how it was that they lacked any nature
of their own. And this is because every existing object, whether it be something
of the ultimate kind or the deceptive kind, is included within one of these three
types.

Here's another reason why this is true. Lord Buddha stated, in the sutras of
the Mother and others as well, that none of the individual members of the
following groups had any nature of being a thing: neither the five heaps, nor
the eighteen categories, nor the twelve doors of sense. He said none of them
had any nature of being a thing, none had any quality of its own, and none
had any nature of its own. More specifically, he mentioned by name all the
different versions of the ultimate: emptiness, the sphere of being, the way

things are, and so on--and then he went on to say that none of them had any
nature of its own. What person in their right mind then could ever say that
there were no things of the ultimate type among those objects of which Lord
Buddha spoke?

Here next is the second step: the expanded explanation. Now you might think
to yourself,
Consider all those things that Lord Buddha was talking about
when he said that nothing had any nature of its own. Suppose
they are all included within the three different types of things
that have no nature of their own. What then are these three
types of things, and how is it that they lack any nature of their
own?
Let's begin by explaining the first type of thing that has no nature of its own.
The Commentary on the True Intent says,
Suppose you ask what we mean when we speak of the quality of
being a thing that "lacks any definitive nature." Here we are
referring to those things that display the attribute of being a
construct.

DE CI'I PHYIR ZHE NA, 'DI LTAR DE NI MING DANG BRDAS RNAM PAR BZHAG PA'I MTSAN NYID YIN GYI RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYIS RNAM PAR GNAS PA NI MA YIN PAS DE'I PHYIR DE NI MTSAN NYID NGO BO NYID MED PA NYID CES BYA'O ZHES GSUNGS TE,
And why do we speak of them as such? It is because of the fact
that these things display the attribute of being established
through names and terms; they are not things which abide by
definition; thus can we say of them that they "lack any definitive
nature."

TSIG DANG PO GNYIS KYI DRIS LAN GYIS KUN BRTAGS MTSAN NYID NGO BO NYID MED PAR BSHAD NAS, DE CI'I PHYIR ZHE NA ZHES PAS DE'I RGYU MTSAN DRIS PA'I LAN DU DGAG PHYOGS NAS RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYIS MA GRUB PA DANG SGRUB PHYOGS NAS MING DANG BRDAS BZHAG PA YIN PA'I RGYU MTSAN GSUNGS SO, , MDO YI DMIGS 'BYED PA 'DIS 'OG MA GNYIS KYANG SHES PAR BYA'O, ,
The question and answer that appear in the first two sentences serve to
identify constructs as what are being referred to when we speak of "things that
lack any definitive nature." The part that begins with "And why do we speak
of them as such?" serves as an answer to the question of what reason there is
for us to describe them as such. Then Lord Buddha answers by giving us two
reasons: one from the negative point of view, where he says that these things
do not exist by definition; and one from the positive point of view, where he
says that they are established through names and terms. The way in which the
sutra approaches the question from these two different aspects can be
understood to apply to the latter two attributes as well.

KUN BRTAGS LA MED RGYU'I MTSAN NYID KYI NGO BO NYID NI RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYIS GRUB PA'AM GNAS PA LA BYA'O, ,
The definitive nature of their own which constructs lack refers to their existing,
or abiding, by definition.

'DIR RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYIS YOD MED BSTAN TSOD NI MING DANG BRDA LA LTOS NAS BZHAG MA BZHAG YIN LA, BZHAG PA LA YANG YOD PAS MA KHYAB CING 'JOG LUGS KYANG THAL 'GYUR BAS YOD PA RNAMS MING GI THA SNYAD KYI DBANG GIS BZHAG PA DANG CHES MI MTHUN PAS RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYIS YOD MED KYI DON YANG MI MTHUN NO, ,
Here the question of whether something is said to exist by definition or not
hinges on whether or not it is established through names and terms; and it is
not necessarily the case that those things which are so established even exist
at all. What is meant by this "establishing" is furthermore quite different from

what the Consequence group means when it says that all existing objects are
established by virtue of terms that are names; and what it means then to exist
by definition or not is also something different.

'ON KYANG 'DI'I RANG MTSAN KYIS YOD PAR 'DZIN PA YOD NA THAL 'GYUR BA'I RANG MTSAN GYIS GRUB PAR 'DZIN PA YANG YOD LA GZHI 'GA' ZHIG SNGA MA LTAR MI 'DZIN KYANG PHYI MA LTAR 'DZIN PA NI YOD DO, ,
It is however the case that--if one is holding things to exist definitively as it
is described in this school--one is also holding things to exist by definition as
it is described by the Consequence group; whereas with a certain number of
objects one may still hold them in the latter way yet still not hold them in the
former way.

Here is what the second lack of a self-nature refers to. The Commentary on the
True Intent of the Sutras says:
Suppose you ask what we mean when we speak of the quality of
being a thing that "lacks any nature of growing." Here we are
referring to those things that display the attribute of being a
dependent thing.

DE CI'I PHYIR ZHE NA, 'DI LTAR DE NI RKYEN GZHAN GYI STOBS KYIS BYUNG BA YIN GYI BDAG NYID KYIS MA YIN PAS DE'I PHYIR DE NI SKYE BA NGO BO NYID MED PA NYID CES BYA'O ZHES GSUNGS SO, ,
And why do we speak of them as such? It is because of the fact
that these things have occurred by virtue of other factors, and not
all by themselves, that we say of them that they "lack any nature
of growing."

GZHAN DBANG LA MED RGYU'I SKYE BA'I NGO BO'AM NGO BO NYID KYIS SKYE BA NI BDAG NYID KYIS MA 
YIN PAS ZHES GSUNGS PAS BDAG NYID KYIS SKYE BA'O, ,
Given the phrase about "not all by themselves," the nature of growing that
dependent things lack, or their growing through some nature of their own,
refers to their growing all by themselves.

This would be a kind of growing where they grew independently, for as the
Abbreviation says,
Because things which are factors occur through interdependence,
we say that they grow by virtue of their conditions; when we say
that these are the type that "lack any nature of growing," we are
talking about their growing on their own.

Remember, this is a system which says that dependent things were spoken to
lack any nature of their own because they have no nature of growing in this
way; that is, through some quality of their own. They do not though say that
something has no nature of its own just because it does not exist by definition.

BO NYID MED PA YANG YIN NO, ,
There are two different ways of establishing the third lack of a self-nature; here
is how we establish the fact that dependent things have no nature of being
ultimate. The Commentary on the True Intent says:
Suppose you ask what we mean when we say that things "lack
any nature of being ultimate." Consider those things which occur
through interdependence; those which lack any nature in the
sense that they lack any nature of growing. These are as well
that which lacks any nature in the sense of lacking any nature of
being ultimate.

And why do we speak of them as such? Listen, Paramarta
Samudgata. What I have professed so thoroughly is that the
"ultimate" refers to the part of things which is the object of [the
path of] total purity. Because those that display the attribute of
being a dependent thing are not the object of [the path of] total
purity, we can speak of them as that one that lacks any nature of
being ultimate.

It is because dependent things do not exist as things which have any nature of
being ultimate that we can speak of that which does not have any nature of
being ultimate. The point here is that "ultimate" refers to anything which,
when you focus on and meditate upon it, your spiritual obstacles are brought

to an end. Dependent things though cannot be described as such, since they
do not have the power to help you purify yourself of your spiritual obstacles
if you focus on and meditate upon them.

"Now why," one may ask, "do you not also establish constructs as being
something which has no nature of being ultimate?" It's true that--if we were
to establish something as being such solely on the basis of its not being an
object of [the path of] total purity--then we would have to do so. It is due to
the fact that we are attempting to stop wrong ideas though that we do
establish dependent things as things which--because they are not objects of
[the path] of total purity--have no nature of being ultimate; but do not
establish constructs as things which are this way.

Why is this the case? Suppose that a person came to an understanding that
they could purify themselves of their spiritual obstacles by focussing on, and
then meditating upon, the fact that dependent things are empty of [certain]
constructs. It is possible then that they might entertain the thought
that--because to go through this process they had to focus upon dependent
things as an example--then these same dependent things would be objects of
[the path of] total purity. This in turn would mean that these dependent things
were ultimate. A person would not though entertain this same thought about
constructs.

DOGS PA DE'I SKYON NI MED DE SGRA MI RTAG PAR NGES PAS SGRA RTAG 'DZIN ZLOG KYANG SGRA LA DMIGS PAS RTAG 'DZIN MI ZLOG PA MI 'GAL BA BZHIN NO, ,
There is in actuality by the way no problem that this particular thought might
be correct. It's similar to the case where a person is able to stop his tendency
of believing that sound is an unchanging thing once he has perceived that it
is a changing thing. There is no contradiction in this example if one were to
say though that you would not stop your tendency of believing that sound is
an unchanging thing [simply] by focussing on sound.

GZHAN DBANG RNAM PAR DAG PA'I DMIGS PA LA DON DAM DU BYAS PA'I DON DAM DER MA GRUB KYANG DON DAM GZHAN DU GRUB MA GRUB NI 'CHAD PAR 'GYUR RO, ,
Despite the fact that dependent things do not exist as something ultimate in the
sense of being ultimate by virtue of being the object of [the path of] total
purity, there still remains the question of whether they exist as something
ultimate in other senses; we will cover this further on.

This second way of establishing something as a thing that lacks any nature of
being ultimate is, further, described as follows in the Commentary on the True
Intent:
Moreover, we also refer to that attribute of totality which things
have as being their "quality of lacking any nature of being
ultimate."

DE'I PHYIR DON DAM PA NGO BO NYID MED PA NYID CES BYA'O, , ZHES GSUNGS SO, ,
And why do we speak of them as such? Listen, Paramarta
Samudgata. We refer to that lack of a self-nature of objects
which all things have as being their "lack of a nature of their
own." The "ultimate" is delineated by being that simple lack that
every existing thing has of any nature of its own; and this is why
we can speak of the quality of lacking any nature of being
ultimate.

Totality in the sense of the lack of a self-nature of objects which all things
exhibit is an object of [the path of] total purity, and is thus on one count
something ultimate. But it is also delineated by the lack that things have of
any self-nature of the person, by this simple absence of something; and this is
why we can speak of all things as "lacking any nature of their own." This too
is a reason why we can say that things "lack any nature of being ultimate."

This point is supported by the Commentary on the True Intent where it says,
If the characteristic of being a factor and the characteristic of
being ultimate were unconnected, then there is no way that the
simple lack of a self-nature to factors and their simple lack of a
nature of their own could be their attribute of being ultimate.

The point is also supported by the fact that, in the sections where an
illustration is used, it is stated that the lack of a self-nature is established in the
same way as we establish empty space; that is, as being the simple lack of any
physical matter. It is therefore extremely clear that totality, in the form of the
lack of a self-nature to objects, is established for produced things as being the
simple absence of their imagined self-existence: the raw exclusion of some self-
nature to objects.

It is a complete contradiction on this subject to assert, on the one hand, that the
descriptions of thusness in this sutra are to be taken as literal; and on the other
hand to assert that this changeless totality is a self-standing, positive object: one
which is not established simply as the result of a process of exclusion--the
simple exclusion of what we deny when we speak of "no-self," and something
which we picture as an object in our minds only by relying on the act of
excluding what we deny by "no-self."

Remember that this is a school where we say that totality is the simple
exclusion of a self-nature with regard to all things; and this is why Lord
Buddha spoke of the "lack of a nature of being ultimate." It is not though the
case that the school asserts that this absence has no nature of its own for the
reason that it has a nature that lacks any quality of existing by definition.

Here finally is the third step: illustrations for the points covered. These three
lacks of a self-nature can be described with three different illustrations. The
Commentary on the True Intent begins by saying,
You can view the quality of lacking any definitive nature as
being like the illustration of a flower that grows in mid-air.

DON DAM YANG DAG 'PHAGS, DE LA 'DI LTA STE DPER NA SGYU MA BYAS PA JI LTA BA DE LTA BUR NI SKYE BA NGO BO NYID MED PA NYID BLTA BAR BYA'O, , DON DAM PA NGO BO NYID MED PA NYID DE LAS KYANG GCIG KYANG BLTA BAR BYA'O, ,
It is, O Paramarta Samudgata, like this: you can view the quality
of not having any nature of growing as being like the illustration
of a magic show. And as for the quality of not having any nature
of being ultimate, you can view it in yet a different way from
those.

It is, O Paramarta Samudgata, like this: you can view this quality
as being like the illustration of empty space, which is delineated
by being a simple lack of anything with a physical nature, and
which extends to all things. The lack of having any nature of
being ultimate is the same: this particular quality is, in a way
different from those others, delineated by being a lack of any self-
nature to objects, and also extends to all things.

Saying that constructs are similar to a flower that grows in mid-air is only
meant to illustrate how they exist merely in the imagination; the point is not
to give an example of something that doesn't exist in the universe. The way
in which dependent things are similar to a magic trick we will explain later on,
and the point of the illustration used for totality is clear from the context in
which it appears.

This is the way one should explain how it is that things lack any nature of
their own when the sutra speaks of a "lack of any nature of their own." If on
the other hand one were to say that "lacking any nature of their own" meant
that none of the three natures existed by definition, then you would be
expressing the belief that the sutras which state that nothing has any nature of
its own are to be taken to mean exactly what they say. This would amount to
espousing the view that nothing exists, or the view that everything has
discontinued. This in turn would be discounting the existence of all three of
the natures; and we could say then that you had turned into one of those
people who holds the view that nothing has any definitive characteristics at all.

How this works, according to this school, is the following: if it were not the
case that there were any dependent things that existed by definition, then they
could never grow or stop--and one would thus be discounting their existence.
If there were no examples of totality that existed by definition, then this could
never be the core nature of every functional thing.

GAL TE RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYIS MA GRUB PAR LTA BA NGO BO NYID GZHAN GNYIS LA SKUR 'DEBS YIN DU CHUG KYANG KUN BRTAGS LA SKUR 'DEBS SU JI LTAR 'GYUR SNYAM NA,
Suppose, on this point, one were to raise the following question:
I can see how--if one were to hold the viewpoint that they did
not exist by definition--one would be discounting the existence
of the two natures. How is it though that you would be
discounting the existence of constructs?

The point is that, if it were the case that the two natures did not exist by
definition, then they could never exist at all. And if they did not exist, then
there would be no object towards which we apply the constructs, and none of
the terms that the one who applies the constructs uses. Constructs themselves
then would become something that did not exist at all.

In this same vein, the Commentary on the True Intent says:
I will explain to you my true intent. It may be the case that you
believe in things, that you fail to grasp fully the profound and
pure way that things really are. And then you will come to
believe, firmly, that I only meant exactly what I said about the
nature of all things when I said the following:
None of these things at all has any nature of its
own; and they are no other way. None of these
things at all ever grows; and they are no other way.
None of them ever stops; and they are no other
way. They are extinct, and have been so from the
very beginning; and they are no other way. They
have, by their very nature, gone completely beyond
the state of grief; and they are no other way.

If one were to start from this point, it would amount to
espousing the view that nothing exists at all, and the view that
nothing has any definitive characteristics at all. And once one
reached the point of espousing the view that nothing exists, or
that nothing has any definitive characteristics, then one would
be discounting the existence of all things, from the point of view

of each and every one of their attributes. This is true because
one would then be discounting the existence of the attribute of
having constructs for every existing thing; and one would also be
discounting the existence of the attributes of having dependent
things and having totality.

And why would this be the case? Listen, Paramarta Samudgata.
The point is that--if something displays the attribute of having
a dependent thing, and the attribute of having totality--then we
can understand it to display the attribute of having constructs.
This being the case, anyone who holds the opinion that the
attribute of having a dependent thing and the attribute of having
totality have no definitive characteristics at all would also be
discounting the existence of the attribute of having constructs.
Such a person, we would then have to say, would be discounting
the existence of all three of the attributes.

What does the "what I said" refer to in the sentence about "believing that I
meant exactly what I said"? It refers to statements in the sutras where Lord
Buddha taught that nothing has any nature of its own: where he stated that all

existing things are devoid of any nature which they have; void of any nature
of their own; void of any nature of existing by definition. Any school that
believed that these were to be taken just as they were spoken would be, in this
context, a school that "believed that I meant exactly what I said."

"The opinion that the attributes of having a dependent thing and having
totality have no definitive characteristics at all" refers to the opinion that
neither of these two exists by definition. And everything from "Why would
this be the case?" on down is meant to present the rationale for saying that one
would be discounting the existence of all three of the natures.

You should further understand the point that--if one were to take on face
value Lord Buddha's statements that neither the growth of things nor their
stopping exists by definition--then one would be discounting the existence of
dependent things. This being the case, one would effectively be discounting
the existence of the other two attributes as well. And this is because--in this
school at least--growing and stopping themselves could never exist at all if
they did not exist by definition.

GNYIS PA NI, NGO BO NYID MED PA'I TSUL DE LTAR YIN NA SKYE BA MED PA SOGS GANG LA DGONGS NAS GSUNGS SHE NA,
Here next is the second of the two sections on the answer. One may ask the
following question: "If that's what Lord Buddha had in mind when he said that
nothing had any nature of its own, then what was it he had in mind when he
said 'nothing grows' and the like?

'DI NI NGO BO NYID MED PA DANG PO DANG THA MA LA DGONGS NAS GSUNGS TE, DE YANG DANG PO NI DGONGS 'GREL LAS, DE LA MTSAN NYID NGO BO NYID MED PA NYID LA DGONGS NAS NGAS CHOS THAMS CAD MA SKYES PA MA 'GAGS PA GZOD MA NAS ZHI BA RANG BZHIN GYIS 
YONGS SU MYA NGAN LAS 'DAS PA'O ZHES BSTAN TO, ,
What Lord Buddha had in mind when he mentioned those was the first and
the last of the three kinds of a lack of any nature. The first is mentioned in the
Commentary on the True Intent as follows:
I did say that nothing that exists ever grows, or stops; that they
are all extinct, and have been so from the very beginning; and
that they have, by their very nature, gone completely beyond the
state of grief. What I had in mind when I said so was the quality
of lacking any definitive nature.

Why is that? This is how it works, Paramarta Samudgata. Those
things which do not exist by definition are things that never
grow. Those things that never grow are things that never stop.
Those things that never grow nor stop are things which are
extinct, and which have been so from the very beginning. Those
things that are extinct, and which have been so from the very
beginning, are things that have, by their very nature, gone
completely beyond the state of grief. And those things which
have, by their very nature, gone completely beyond the state of
grief have nothing at all about them which is gone completely
beyond the state of grief.

MTSAN NYID KYIS GRUB PA'I SKYE 'GAG YOD PAR YANG BSTAN NO, ,
The reason given here for saying that constructs never grow or stop is that
they are things which do not exist by definition. The text is thereby also
indicating that--if something did exhibit growing or stopping--then it would
exist by definition; and that dependent things do exhibit growing and stopping
which exist by definition.

Objects of the kind that are bereft of any growing or stopping are unproduced
things; and these are not the types of things that can belong to the mentally-
afflicted side of things. This is why they are spoken of as "extinct, from the
very beginning," and "gone, by their very nature, completely beyond grief"; for
the meaning of "grief" here is the mentally-afflicted side of things.

The second of the three lacks treated here is described in the Commentary on the
True Intent as follows:
And from another point of view did I say that nothing that exists
ever grows, or stops; that they are all extinct, and have been so
from the very beginning; and that they have, by their very
nature, gone completely beyond the state of grief. What I had in
mind when I said so was the quality of lacking any nature of
being ultimate: that which is delineated by the absence of a self-
nature to objects.

Why is that? This is how it works. The quality of lacking any
nature of being ultimate--that which is delineated by the absence
of a self-nature to objects--is something that only continues, in
the time of changeless changelessness, and in the time of
unshaking unshakability. This is that unproduced thing which
is the real nature of all existing things, and it is free of everything
mentally afflicted.

Think about this thing, that real nature of things, an unproduced
thing that continues in the time of changeless changelessness, and
in the time of unshaking unshakability. Because it is an
unproduced thing, it neither grows nor stops. And because it is
free of any of the mentally afflicted things, then it is also extinct,
from the very beginning, and something which is, by its very
nature, gone completely beyond the state of grief. . .

RTAG PA RTAG PA'I DUS NI SNGA MA SNGA MA'I DUS DANG THER ZUG THER ZUG GI DUS NI PHYI MA PHYI MA'I DUS LA RGYA NAG GI 'GREL CHEN LAS BSHAD DO, ,
The Great Commentary explains the expression "time of changeless
changelessness" as referring to all the time that has gone before, and the
expression "time of unshaking unshakability" as meaning all the time that will
come afterwards.

'O NA 'DIR NGO BO NYID MED PA'I GZHI GSUM GA LA MDZAD NAS SKYE BA SOGS MED PA'I GZHI NGO BO NYID MED PA BAR PA LA MI MDZAD PA DANG,
One might raise the following question:
When they talked about what it was that lacked any self nature,
they referred to all three kinds of lacking a self-nature. But then
when they talked about what it was that lacked any growing or
the rest, they failed to refer to the middle kind of a lack of a self-
nature. Why is that?

And why too does the Compendium explain the lack of any
growing, and the rest, with reference to all three of the attributes
where it says,
. . . Because the lack of any definitive nature refers
to the nature of constructs; and the lack of any
nature of growing refers to dependent things; and

the lack of any nature of being ultimate refers to
totality. And what did Lord Buddha have in mind
when he spoke of things that "never grow," "never
stop," are "extinct from the very beginning," and
"gone--by their very nature--beyond all grief"?
Things that "never grow" do so exactly as those
things that have no nature of their own lack their
nature. Things that "never stop" do so exactly as
those things that never grow never grow. Things
that are "extinct from the very beginning" are that
way just as those things that never grow and never
stop are those ways. And that in turn is exactly
how things are, by their very nature, beyond all
grief.

The Great Commentary from China says on this point that the reason why
dependent things are not mentioned in the sutra as being what Lord Buddha
was referring to with the expressions "never grow" and so on is that the sutra
means to indicate that these are not things of the kind which lack any nature
of occurring through dependent origination.

The real point of the sutra though is as follows. Dependent things do exhibit
growing and stopping, of a kind that exist by definition. Therefore these
dependent things are not what Lord Buddha had in mind when he spoke of
"never growing" or "never stopping." Moreover, the vast majority of dependent
things are taken in by the mentally-afflicted side of things; and so this is why
the dependent things are not described as something that Lord Buddha has in
mind when he mentions the latter two expressions.

And here is what the Compendium is referring to when it says that things never
grow the same way they have no nature; and that this is too how they never
stop, and how they are extinct from the very beginning, and how they are, by
their very nature, completely beyond all grief: the point is that we are to refer,
in each case, to that particular nature which each one of the three natures,
respectively, is said to lack when we describe it.

Here is the third division from above: an identification of the nature of the
three real natures. "You have said," one may begin, "that the 'lack of a
definitive nature' refers to constructs. But just what are these constructs
themselves?" Our answer is drawn from the Commentary on the True Intent:
Consider that thing which is established through names and
terms as either the attribute that relates to the very essence, or
the attribute that relates to some particular, when we focus on
something which is (1) the arena in which the constructing state
of mind acts; (2) the object of the attribute of constructs; and (3)
that which exhibits the typical features of a factor; and speak of
it as "the heap of physical matter."
Consider as well that thing which is established through names
and terms as either the attribute that relates to the very essence,
or the attribute that relates to some particular, when we focus on
the same thing and speak of "the growing of the heap of physical
matter," or its "stopping," or "eliminating" or "grasping" this heap
of physical matter.
This thing is what we refer to as "the attribute of constructs."

DE LA TSIG DANG PO GSUM GYIS NI KUN BRTAGS 'DOGS PA'I GZHI BSTAN LA DE MAN CHAD KYIS KUN TU BRTAGS TSUL STON TE, 'DI GZUGS PHUNG NGOO ZHES NGO BO DANG GZUGS PHUNG SKYE'O ZHES SOGS SU BTAGS PA NI BYE BRAG GAM KHYAD PAR DU BTAGS TSUL YIN TE ZHIB TU 'CHAD PAR 'GYUR RO, ,
Now the three numbered items are descriptions of the object towards which
a construct is applied. The rest is a description of how the application of the
construct is carried out: you either apply a construct about the general essence
of an object by saying this is the "heap of physical matter," or you apply a
construct about the particulars or features of the same object by saying, "the
heap of physical matter is growing," or one of the others. We will be
examining this point in further detail.

"And you have said," one may continue, "that the 'lack of a nature of growing'
refers to dependent things. But just what are these dependent things?" Again
we turn to the Commentary on the True Intent:
Consider that thing which is (1) the arena in which the
constructing state of mind acts; (2) the object of the attribute of
constructs; and (3) that which exhibits the typical features of a
factor. This thing is what we refer to as "the attribute of
dependent things."
The first term indicates what it is that takes dependent things as its object; the
second indicates that dependent things are the basis towards which the
constructs are applied; and the third indicates the very nature of dependent
things.

"You have finally said," one may conclude, "that the 'lack of a nature of being
ultimate' refers to totality. But just what is totality?" Again, the Commentary
on the True Intent says:
Consider the fact that the thing which is (1) the arena in which
the constructing state of mind acts; (2) the object of the attribute
of constructs; and (3) that which exhibits the typical features of
a factor itself is--in its totality--free of the attribute of constructs.

Consider the fact that it is impossible for it to have any nature of
having that one specific nature. Consider the fact that it is
impossible for it to display any self-nature of objects. And
consider that essential nature which is the object perceived by
[the path of] purity. This is what we refer to as "the attribute of
totality."

CHOS LA ZHES SOGS KYIS CHOS KYI BDAG MED DE BZHIN NYID CES BRJOD PA GANG LA DMIGS NAS BSGOMS PAS SGRIB PA DAG PAR 'GYUR BA DE NYID YONGS GRUB TU NGOS BZUNG NGO , ,
The phrasing around the words "of objects" is saying, "that thing we talk about
as the lack of any self-nature of objects, or the essential nature of things."
Totality is being identified as that one thing which--if you focus on it and then
meditate upon it--your spiritual obstacles are cleaned away.

CHOS KYI BDAG MED DE GANG ZHE NA NGO BO NYID MA MCHIS PA NYID DE NYID NI DE KHO NA ZHES PA'I DON NO, ,
And what is the lack of a self-nature to objects? It is, as the text says, the fact
that it is impossible for these things to have any nature, a nature of having that
one specific nature.

One may ask just what kind of a nature it is that these things lack. The
"nature of having that one specific nature" is referring to the nature that was
just mentioned; that is, that of constructs. The words "that one" are meant to
exclude the others, meaning the other two natures. Therefore the point here
is not to say that it is impossible for these two to have any nature. The word
"totality," the text is saying, refers to that one lack of a nature: the lack of a
nature to constructs.

DE NYID GONG MAS BSHAD PA NI RNAM PAR RTOG PA ZHES PA NAS DE NYID CES PA'I BAR GYIS GZHAN DBANG STONG GZHIR BSTAN NAS KUN BRTAGS KYI MTSAN NYID DU MA GRUB CES PAS DE NYID KUN BRTAGS KYIS STONG PA LA YONGS GRUB TU SHIN TU GSAL BAS, MDO 'DIS STONG TSUL BSTAN PA NGES DON DU 'DOD PA DANG NGO BO NYID THA MA NGO BO NYID DANG PO GNYIS KYIS STONG PA YONGS GRUB TU 'DOD PA YANG 'GAL BA'O, ,
Here is what the words "the thing" that come first refer to. Everything from
the words "consider the fact" down to "a factor itself" is meant to indicate that
dependent things are the thing which has the emptiness. The words "free of
the attribute of constructs" is a very clear statement that totality is something
which refers to the fact that these things are empty or devoid of constructs. It
is therefore a further contradiction to assert, on the one hand, that the manner
in which this sutra teaches emptiness is literal, and then to assert at the same
time that totality consists of the fact that the last of the three natures is empty
or devoid of the first two.

The emptiness or voidness here, moreover, is not the kind you have when a
specific spot is empty or devoid of a water pitcher; not just the denial of some
other thing. Dependent things, rather, are empty or devoid of any nature
where they exist as the constructs--in the same way that a person does not
exist as a substantial thing.

DE NYID KYI PHYIR MDO LAS, DE NYID KUN BRTAGS PA'I MTSAN NYID DER YONGS SU MA GRUB CING , ZHES GSUNGS SO, ,
It is for this exact reason that the sutra says that "the thing" is, "in its totality,
free of the attribute of constructs."

What are the kinds of constructs that these things are devoid or empty of? The
sutra, in these two places where it undertakes to identify the nature of a
construct, makes no mention of any other constructs beyond the sole two: those
applied towards the very essence of an object and those applied towards its
features. I will explain why the sutra fails to mention the others later on.

We have thus shown how the three attributes can be applied to the heap of
physical matter; similar sets of three can be applied as well to the four
remaining heaps; to the twelve doors of sense; to the twelve links of dependent
origination; to the four types of sustenance; to the six elements; and to the
eighteen categories.

Let's take for example the truth of suffering. The constructs here are those
things that are established through names and terms when you focus on the
object of your construct and think to yourself either of its very essence--with
the words "truth of suffering"--or of its particulars, in wording such as "The
truth of suffering is something that a person should realize is happening to
them." The dependent thing here is just the same as we described it above,

and so is the totality; you can even use the same expression and say it is
"impossible for it to have any nature of having that one specific nature." Use
this same pattern for the other truths.

The pattern applies as well to all seven groups within the elements of
enlightenment. Again you are, as before, choosing a basis to receive the label,
and then applying constructs either to its essence (in the words, for example,
that "this is a pure state of concentration") or to its features (by speaking about
the this or that that it has; speaking, as we mentioned before, about the things
that work against it, or the spiritual antidote involved, or anything of the like).
Then you go into the other two natures, just as we did with the truth of
suffering.

All this then shows how it is that we can establish three attributes each for
every one of the items mentioned in the original question meant to clarify
those apparent inconsistencies: for everything from the heap of physical matter
up to the various elements of the path. And Paramarta Samudgata respectfully
says to the Teacher, "Now I understand why you taught the different kinds of
a lack of self-nature as being three, for you were thinking of how we establish
the three attributes this way."

BZHI PA LA GNYIS, MDO DGOD PA DANG , DE'I DON CUNG ZAD BSHAD PA'O, , DANG PO NI,
Here now is the fourth division from above: a statement, offered by the
bodhisattva, of the conclusion reached through the preceding points. We
proceed in two steps: a presentation of the relevant passage of the sutra, and
then a brief explanation of its meaning. Here is the first.

DE LTAR NA GSUNG RAB LA CHOS RNAMS RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYIS YOD PA DANG CHOS RNAMS RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYIS MA GRUB PAR STON PA DANG , RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYIS GRUB MA GRUB LEGS PAR PHYE BA'I MDO SDE GSUM BYUNG ZHING DE DAG KYANG NGO BO NYID YOD MED LEGS PAR PHYE MA PHYE GNYIS SU 'GYUR LA PHYE BA NI DON GZHAN DU DRANG BAR MI BYA BAS NGES PA'I DON DANG , MA PHYE BA NI DON GZHAN DU DRANG DGOS PAS DRANG BA'I DON YIN LA,
DE LA YANG GNYIS YOD PAS MDO SDE GNYIS DRANG DON DANG GCIG NGES DON DU SNGAR BSHAD PA RNAMS KYI SHUGS KYIS SHES PAR 'GYUR RO, ,
We see then that Lord Buddha has taught, in his highest of all spoken words,
three different groups of sutra: one in which he said that every existing thing
does exist by definition; one in which he said that no existing thing exists by
definition; and a third in which he made fine distinctions between things,
saying that some exist by definition, and some do not.
We see further that these various sutras can be grouped into two categories:
those that do and those that do not make fine distinctions between the
different ways in which things have no nature of their own at all. Those that
do make these distinctions do not need to be interpreted further, and are
therefore considered literal. Those that do not make these distinctions must be
interpreted further, and so are considered figurative. There are two groups of
the latter, and so we can say that two of the groups of sutra are figurative, and
one is literal. All this we can understand by implication, from the discussions
that have appeared earlier.

This way in which we speak of the three historical turnings of the wheel as
being either figurative or literal, this point that we arrive at through
implication from what has come before, is expressed to the Teacher by the
bodhisattva Paramarta Samudgata in the following words from the Commentary
on the True Intent:
O Conqueror, you taught first in the land of Varanasi, in the
forest full of wild animals, the wood of the saints; you imparted
a teaching on the subject of the four realized truths to those who
had entered, perfectly, the way of the listeners. And in doing so
you turned, perfectly, a wheel of the Dharma which was
amazing, and awe-inspiring; one which no being--neither god
nor man--had ever turned accurately in this world ever before.
And Conqueror, this perfect turning of the wheel of the Dharma
was one which had something higher; it was one which left an
opening; it was one which had to be interpreted further; and it
was one which could serve as a basis for contention.

And then, O Conqueror, you turned the wheel of the Dharma a
second time, for the benefit of those who had entered, perfectly,
the greater way. This time you took an appearance of speaking
of emptiness, doing so by bringing up first the fact that no
existing thing could ever have any nature of its own--and then
going on to the facts that nothing could ever grow; and that
nothing could ever stop; and that everything was extinct from the

very beginning, and that everything was, by its very nature,
completely beyond all grief.
This turning of the wheel of the Dharma was one which was ever
so amazing, and ever so awe-inspiring. And Conqueror, this
turning of the wheel of the Dharma as well was one which had
something higher; it was one which left an opening; it was one
which had to be interpreted further; and it was one which could
serve as a basis for contention.

And then, O Conqueror, you turned the wheel of the Dharma a
third time, imparting a teaching to those who had entered,
perfectly, every one of the different ways: you spoke to them of
how to make the fine distinctions. And you did this by bringing
up first the fact that no existing thing could ever have any nature
of its own--and then going on to the facts that nothing could
ever grow; and that nothing could ever stop; and that everything
was extinct from the very beginning, and that everything was, by
its very nature, completely beyond all grief. This too was a
turning of the wheel which was amazing, and awe-inspiring.

But Conqueror, this turning of the wheel of the Dharma was one
which had nothing higher; it was one which left no opening; it
was one which could be taken literally; and it was one which
could never serve as a basis for contention.

GNYIS PA LA GNYIS, MDO'I TSIG DON CUNG ZAD BSHAD PA DANG , DRANG NGES KYI TSUL CUNG ZAD BSHAD PA'O, ,
Here secondly is our brief explanation of the meaning of the sutra. Here too
there are two parts: a brief explanation of the meaning of the wording of the
sutra, and a brief explanation of the distinction between teaching which is
figurative and teaching which is literal.

DANG PO NI, DE LA 'KHOR LO DANG PO BSKOR BA LA GNAS NI TSIG DANG POS BSTAN LA GDUL BYA NI GNYIS PAS SO, , 'PHAGS PA'I ZHES PA NAS BSKOR TE ZHES PA'I BAR GYIS 'KHOR LO'I NGO BO BSTAN NO, , BDEN PA BZHI'I RNAM PA BSTAN ZHES PA NI BRJOD BYA GANG LAS BRTZAMS NAS BSTAN PA'O, , NGO MTSAR SOGS NI DE'I BSNGAGS PA'O, , DE YANG ZHES SOGS NI NGES DON MIN PAR STON PA'O, , DE LA BLA NA MCHIS PA NI 'DI'I GONG NA KHYAD PAR CAN GYI BSTAN PA YOD PA'O, , SKABS MCHIS PA NI 'DI LAS SKABS KHYAD PAR CAN GYI BSTAN PA YOD PA'O, , STONG PA NYID MI STON ZHING YOD PAR STON PAS DRANG BA'I DON NO, , RTZOD PA DANG BCAS PA NI GZHAN GYIS GZHIG PAR BYA BA DANG NYAN THOS SDE PA RNAMS KYI RTZOD PA SMRA BA'I GNAS SU GYUR PA'O, , ZHES WEN TSEG GIS BSHAD DO,
Here is the first. Wentsek explains the wording of this citation from the sutra
as follows. The first part of the quotation about the first turning of the wheel
of the Dharma is meant to indicate where this wheel was turned; then the
second part is meant to indicate the types of disciples for whom it was turned.
The part about "imparting a teaching" in a wheel "never turned before" on the
subject of the "four realized truths" is meant to convey the very nature of this
turning of the wheel.
The part about "imparting a teaching on the subject of the four realized truths"
is intended to convey the subject matter which Lord Buddha brought up in this
turning of the wheel. The phrase with "amazing" and so on is intended as a
praise of this turning. The wording "this turning as well" is meant to indicate
that this second turning was not something we could take literally.

"Having something higher" means that this particular turning of the wheel
does have another one which is above it, in the sense of being more
extraordinary. The word "opening" is to be taken as "occasion," meaning that
there does exist a teaching which was imparted on an even more extraordinary
occasion. We say a teaching is "something that we have to interpret further"
when it either fails to teach emptiness or does have this teaching. Teachings
involve "contention" in the sense that they are something that others may
question, and because they provide a basis of contention for those of the
Listener way.

,MDO'I DON NI DANG PO NI BLA NA STE 'DI'I GONG NA NGES DON GZHAN YOD PA'O, ,
The point of the first sutra reference at this juncture is to say that certain
teachings have something "higher than them" in the sense that there are other
teachings that are "above" them, since they can be taken literally.

GNYIS PA NI, 'DI'I DON JI LTAR BSTAN PA LTAR KHAS BLANGS PA LA RGOL BA GZHAN GYI SKYON GYI SKABS MCHIS PA'O, , 'DI LA RGYA NAG GI 'GREL PA LAS RGOL BA DANG BCAS PA ZHES KYANG BSGYUR BAS DON DE LTAR RO, ,
The point of the second reference is that people who accept certain teachings
as saying what they mean thereby leave an "opening" for philosophical
opponents to attack them. This is in fact what the reference actually means,
given the fact that we also see the wording from the Chinese commentary
translated as "involving attacks from opponents."

GSUM PA NI 'DI'I DON GZHAN DU DRANG DGOS PA'O, ,
The point of the third reference is that one cannot accept certain teachings on
face value, and must interpret them further.

BZHI PA NI DON 'DI LTAR YIN STON PAS GSAL POR MA PHYE BAS DON LA MI MTHUN PAR RTZOD PA'O, ,
The point of the fourth reference is that--if the Teacher has failed to make
certain distinctions about a particular teaching clearly, if he has failed to say
"This is what it really means"--then it is possible that contention may arise,
with some people saying that it meant something different.

'KHOR LO GNYIS PA LA CHOS RNAMS KYI ZHES PA NAS BRTZAMS NAS ZHES PA'I BAR NI BRJOD BYA GANG LAS BRTZAMS PA'O, , THEG PA ZHES SOGS NI GANG LA BSKOR BA'I GDUL BYA'O, ,
Consider the part of the sutra reference to the second turning of the Wheel,
from the place where it mentions "bringing up first," all the way down to
"completely beyond all grief." This is meant to describe what subject matter
is brought up for the teaching to proceed. The part about those of a certain
"way" and so on constitutes a description of the kinds of disciples for whom
the particular wheel was turned.

STONG PA NYID SMOS PA'I RNAM PAS ZHES PA'I DON CHOS KYI BDAG MED BSTAN PA LA 'GREL PA KHA CIG GIS BSHAD LA, RGYA NAG GI 'GREL CHEN LAS, MI MNGON PA'I RNAM PAS ZHES KYANG 'BYUNG LA DE'I DON YOD PA MKHYUD PA LA BSHAD DO, ,
The part about "an appearance of teaching emptiness" has been explained in
some commentaries as referring to the lack of a self-nature to objects. We also
see though in the great Chinese commentary the expression "in a way that was
not evident," and this is explained as meaning "it does have this teaching, but
in a concealed way."

'GYUR NI DE LEGS LA DON NI 'KHOR LO PHYI MA GNYIS BRJOD BYA NGO BO NYID MED PA LAS BRTZAMS NAS STON PAR 'DRA BA LA STON TSUL GYI KHYAD PAR NI BAR PAS NGO BO NYID YOD MED SNGAR LTAR MA PHYE BAS MI MNGON PA'I RNAM PAS ZHES GSUNGS LA THA MAS PHYE BAS LEGS PAR RNAM PAR PHYE BA ZHES GSUNGS SO, ,
As far as a translation of the original, this one is better; the point of it is that
the latter two turnings of the wheel are similar in that Lord Buddha gives his
teaching by bringing up the fact that nothing has any nature of its own. There
is however a difference between the two in how they make their presentation:
the middle turning teaches its subject matter in a way which is not "evident,"
meaning without making the distinction between things having a nature of
their own or not as explained above; whereas the final turning is referred to
the "one of fine distinctions" precisely because it does make this distinction.

SDE SNOD GSUM PA WEN TSEG GIS GSUM PA LA LTOS NAS BLA NA YOD PA SOGS LAS MA BSHAD CING , RGYA GAR GYI MKHAN PO YANG DAG BDEN PA'I BSHAD PA BKOD MOD KYANG LEGS PAR MI SNANG BAS MA BRIS LA RANG GI LUGS NI SNGA MA LTAR RO, ,
That master of the three collections of teachings, Wentsek, says nothing more
about the idea of "having something higher" than to describe it as "something
higher relative to the third" turning of the wheel, and such. The Indian
preceptor Yangdak Denpa has admittedly offered an explanation of this point
in his work, but since it does not appear to be a good one I will not repeat it
here; our own position is that already expressed.

'KHOR LO GSUM PA LA BRJOD BYA GANG LAS BRTZAMS PA BAR PA DANG 'DRA ZHING , GDUL BYA NI THEG PA THAMS CAD LA YANG DAG PAR ZHUGS PA STE SNGA MA GNYIS NI THEG PA CHE CHUNG SO SO BA YIN LA 'DI NI GNYI GA'I DBANG DU BYAS PA'O, ,
The subject matter that Lord Buddha brings up in the third turning of the
wheel is similar to that of the middle turning. The disciples for the third
turning are "those who have entered, perfectly, every one of the different
ways"; the point being that, whereas the disciples for the previous two turnings
of the wheel belong one to the greater way and one to the lesser, this third
turning was meant to relate to both.

LEGS PAR PHYE BA NI SNGAR BSHAD PA LTAR GZUGS LA SOGS PA'I CHOS RE RE LA MTSAN NYID GSUM GSUM GYI RNAM GZHAG DANG DE LA NGO BO NYID MED TSUL GSUM GSUM DU PHYE BA'O, ,
The phrase "fine distinctions" here refers to the fact that all three of the various
attributes can be established, as mentioned above, for each of the various
objects of existence--for physical matter or any of the rest; it also refers to the
fact that the lack of a nature to objects is distinguished into three different
types relating to these three.

CHOS KYI 'KHOR LO BSKOR BA 'DI NI ZHES NYE BA'I TSIG GIS SMOS PA NI DE MA THAG TU SMOS 
PA'I LEGS PAR RNAM PAR PHYE BA'I 'KHOR LO DGONGS 'GREL DANG DE BZHIN DU PHYE BA RNAMS LA ZER BA YIN GYI, DUS THA MAR GSUNGS KYANG NGO BO NYID YOD MED KYI TSUL 'DI BZHIN DU MA PHYE BA'I MDO SDE RNAMS LA ZER BA MIN NO, ,
The expression "this turning of the wheel of the Dharma" includes that
pronoun of relative proximity: "this." It applies to the turning of the wheel of
the Dharma in which the fine distinctions were made--that turning of the
wheel which is spoken of immediately afterwards. And this refers to the
Commentary on the True Intent, as well as to other teachings that make similar
distinctions. We do not however refer to those sutras which do not make this
kind of distinction--between something's having a nature of its own or not--as
being this particular turning of the wheel, even if they were spoken by Lord
Buddha during the final period of his teaching.

'KHOR LO DE'I CHE BA NI BLA NA MA MCHIS PA SOGS KYIS STON TE, 'DI MCHOG TU RMAD DU BYUNG ZHING DE LAS LHAG PA GZHAN MED PAS BLA NA MA MCHIS PA DANG , PHYIS MCHOG TU 'GYUR PA'I SKABS DANG GZHIG PA'I SKABS MED PAS SKABS MA MCHIS PA DANG , YOD MED RDZOGS PAR BSTAN PAS NGES PA'I DON DANG , RTZOD PA SMRA BA'I GZHI'I GNAS MIN PA'O, , ZHES WEN TSEG GIS BSHAD PA NI SKABS MED PA'I SNGA MA MA GTOGS PA SNGAR BDAG GIS BLA NA YOD PA SOGS KYI DON BSHAD PA LAS BZLOG PA DANG DON 'DRA'O, ,
The greatness of this last turning of the wheel is indicated in the various
expressions such as "one which has nothing higher." Because this particular
turning of the wheel is supremely awe-inspiring, and because there is no
teaching which is any greater, it "has nothing higher." Because there will be
no later occasion upon which some more supreme teaching is imparted, and
also because with this turning of the wheel there is no opening for others to
raise any questions, it "leaves no opening." Because it definitively relates what
does exist and what does not, it is a turning of the wheel "which can be taken
literally," and which is not a teaching that could serve as a "basis" for someone
to raise any "contention."
This is how Wentsek gives his commentary; except for the former of the two
explanations of the expression "leaves no opening" or "occasion," the basic

meaning of the rest corresponds to the opposite of the meanings I have already
listed for the various expressions beginning with "does have something higher."
 MDO SDE SNGA MA GNYIS KYI SGRA JI BZHIN PA'I DON LA SKYON GYI SKABS YOD LA 'DI LA MED PA NI SGRA JI BZHIN PA'I DON DE LAS GZHAN DU DRANG DGOS MI DGOS KYI RGYU MTSAN GYIS YIN LA, RTZOD PA YOD MED NI MDO SDE'I DON NGO BO NYID YOD MED STON PAS DE LTAR GTAN LA PHAB PA YIN MIN LA MKHAS PAS BRTAGS NA RTZOD SA MED PA LA BYA'I RTZOD PA GZHAN MED PAR STON PA MIN NO, ,
There is an opening or opportunity for criticizing the meaning of the first two
groups of sutra, if you take it on face value. The reason that there is no such
opening or opportunity in this group is that one may take the words on face
value; they need not be interpreted further. Whether or not there is contention
relates to whether or not the point taught by the particular group of sutras is
that things do or do not have a nature of their own. Therefore a lack of
"contention" here refers to whether, when a real thinker examines a teaching
that does or does not make the presentation this way, he will find any point
of contention. "Contention" here though is not meant to refer to just anything
that anyone might find to argue about with regard to the teaching.

Here is the second part from above: a brief explanation of the distinction
between teaching which is figurative and teaching which is literal. The Chinese
commentary refers to these different turnings of the wheel as follows. The first
is the "Turning of the Wheel on the Four Truths," and the second is the
"Turning of the Wheel on How Nothing Exists by Definition." The third is
called the "Turning of the Wheel on Ascertaining the Ultimate." If we follow
the actual wording of the sutra itself though we would refer to the third one
as the "Turning of the Wheel on Fine Distinctions."

Now the way in which this particular sutra decides whether a teaching is
figurative or literal hinges on the two of whether it makes certain fine
distinctions or not. What it is that we are trying to decide is figurative or
literal consists of all three of the teachings: the one in which it was stated
equally for all existing objects that they have some nature of their own, one
which exists by definition; the one in which it was stated equally for all
existing objects that they have no such nature; and the one in which fine
distinctions were made between them, stating that some did and some did not
have such a nature.
The fact that these three are what we are trying to decide is figurative or not
is extremely clear from the following:
1) from the fact that the question in which the bodhisattva is
trying to rule out any apparent inconsistencies, and the answer
that is given, relate to the various groups of sutra;
2) from the way in which three lacks of a self nature are set forth
for every existing thing, and the statement about nothing having
any nature of its own explained in terms of this treatment; and
3) from the way in which the three turnings of the wheel,
delivered as they were during specific periods, are thereby
understood as being either figurative or literal.

SIR LNGA SDE LA SHAM THABS ZLUM POR BGO BAR BYA'O, , ZHES PA LA SOGS PA'I BSLAB BYA GSUNGS PA LA 'DIR DOGS PA GCOD MI DGOS PA BZHIN NO, ,
Therefore what is being indicated as figurative with regard to the first wheel
is that teaching which relates to the initial period, and which starts off from the
four realized truths to make statements such as that all existing things exist by
definition; it is not though the case that we are referring to everything that
Lord Buddha ever spoke during this initial period. Remember that he did, for
example, make statements during this initial period such as his advice to the
Group of Five at Varanasi urging them to "be sure to wear your lower robes
in a neat circle." This is not the kind of teaching that we are concerned with
here, the kind that we have to analyze to find out what it means.

Just so, the second turning of the wheel is defined here according to whether
Lord Buddha made statements such as the one about nothing having any
nature of its own. There are other groups of sutras that do also relate to the
second period of Lord Buddha's teaching, but which are not taught from the
point of view of things not having any nature of their own, or the like. But
since these are not the kinds of teachings about which one might have
questions of the kind that arise in the section of the sutra where the
bodhisattva tries to clarify some apparent inconsistencies, they need not be
clarified here as teachings which are figurative.

The third turning of the wheel that is explained as being literal too is the one
mentioned before: the teachings in which those fine distinctions are made, and
not just everything that was spoken. This fact is made exceedingly clear in the

sutra itself. Lord Buddha, for example, did as he was just about to enter his
final nirvana give a teaching on what he declared would be appropriate
monastic behavior entitled the Summary of Vowed Morality. This is not though
a teaching which this sutra is explaining as being a literal teaching.

One may ask the following question:
What is it that this particular sutra hopes to accomplish by
distinguishing the various turnings of the wheel into those that
are figurative and those that are literal?
The sutra first seeks to prevent us from taking on face value those teachings
which state either that all existing objects exist by definition, or that none exist
by definition, without making any attempt to distinguish them into parts. It
seeks to inform us that constructs do not exist by definition, but that the other
two natures do exist by definition. It finally seeks to teach us that that form
of emptiness represented by the absence of those constructs in dependent
things is the ultimate object perceived by the path. This then is why the sutra
states that the first two turnings of the wheel are figurative, and the final
turning literal.

Given all this, some have used the wording of this sutra to go on and claim
that it proves that everything which Lord Buddha taught during all the periods
is meant to be taken literally. These people would then have to say that
certain statements which the Buddha made to attract those of other religions
who still believed that things could have some self-nature are teachings that
we are meant to take on face value. They also say that no object but the real
nature of things is anything more than the simple delusion of a mistaken state
of mind; these other things have not the slightest bit of an existing nature to
them. They say finally that the meaning of "fine distinctions" is the distinction
between what exists in truth or not, in the sense of being this one true thing:
the real nature of things.

Others have had the concern that--if they were to make the distinction
between the figurative and the literal in the way in which this particular sutra
does so--then they would be forced to make the same claims as the group just
mentioned. Therefore they deny this aspect of the sutra, saying that this
method of distinguishing between the figurative and the literal cannot be
something meant to be taken on face value.

Neither of these two positions seems to have examined carefully how, in this
sutra, the bodhisattva raises questions seeking to explain apparent
inconsistencies in the sutras; or how the Teacher gives his answer; or how,
based on this exchange, certain teachings are said to be figurative, and others
literal. They simply seem to be different arguments about the period
represented by the teachings which make the distinction between the figurative
and the literal.

The following selection is taken from An Analysis of the Distinction between the
Figurative and the Literal, a textbook used at Sera Mey Tibetan Monastery for the
study of this subject. It was written by Kedrup Tenpa Dargye (1493-1568), and gives
both a good sense of the detail in which the monastic textbooks treat their topics, and
also a great deal more information on the three turnings of the wheel in relation to
interpreting what the Buddha has stated. Several typical dialectic sections are
presented here (from folios 1a-5a of the original text), followed by a brief resolution of
the questions raised (from folios 9a-10a). The text that is used is the edition with
ACIP electronic catalog number S0011.

Here is the second part [of the traditional presentation on the art of
interpretation]: a more detailed treatment of how we comment upon the
turning of the wheel of the Dharma in the sense of the physical teachings; that
is, how we decide which teachings were literal, and which were figurative.
This part itself has two divisions: an explanation of the system of the Mind-
Only School, and an explanation of the system of the Middle-Way School. The
first of these has three sections of its own; here is the first of them.

after our Teacher pretended to reach his total enlightenment. And the long,
the medium, and the brief presentations of the perfection of wisdom--these
three--were spoken on Vulture Peak the year after our Teacher pretended to
reach this total enlightenment; and so on.

When we come and state our position that the three turnings of the wheel, as
described directly in the Commentary on the Ture Thought, are established by all
three criteria--by the period in which they were taught, by the disciples for
whom the teaching was meant, and by the subject matter which they
treat--then someone else comes and makes the following claim:

But isn't it the case that these three are not established by the period in
which they were taught?
[Why do you say that?]
Because the Essence of Eloquence states the following:
When the Commentary on the True Intent speaks of
the three stages of the turning of the wheel, it
establishes them neither by the circle of disciples
which had assembled for the teaching, nor by the
period of his life in which the Teacher gave the
teaching, nor by the rest; rather, it establishes them
through the subject matter of the particular
teaching. Now all this relates to setting forth what
it means when we say that nothing has any nature
of its own . . .

Yet there is no such problem, because the meaning of that particular section in
the Essence is to say that these stages are established neither by period alone,
nor by the disciple for whom they were meant alone, nor by the subject matter
which they treat alone.

Suppose this were not the case. Are you saying then that the three turnings
of the wheel, as they are described directly in the Commentary on the True
Intent, are established by the period in which they were taught?

[Why do you say that?]
Because the Essence of Eloquence states the following:
This way in which we speak of the three historical turnings of the
wheel as being either figurative or literal, this point that we
arrive at through implication from what has come before, is
expressed to the Teacher by the bodhisattva Paramarta
Samudgata in the following words from the Commentary on the
True Intent . . .

Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
The following section from the Essence of Eloquence is setting forth the
way in which the Consequence section of the Middle-Way School
explains how to decide whether something Lord Buddha taught was
literal, or whether it was figurative:
There is one set of teachings where, at the
beginning, in Varanasi, Lord Buddha said that the
individual had no self-nature; and then denied that
something could exist in truth with no more than a
very few objects, such as the parts of a person and
so on; and then made many statements that
something could exist in truth.

There is another set of teachings where he made
none of these distinctions, and denied that any
existing object, whether it be the parts of a person
or anything else, could have any true existence of
its own. . .

Because this is a section where Je Tsongkapa is describing the unique position
of the Mind-Only School on how to decide whether something Lord Buddha
taught was literal, or whether it was figurative.

[It's not necessarily the case that--if this is a section where Je
Tsongkapa is describing the unique beliefs of the Mind-Only
School on how to decide whether something Lord Buddha taught
was literal or figurative--then it cannot be the section where he
sets forth how the Consequence group of the Middle-Way School
decides this same question.]
But this is so necessarily the case,
Because if Je Tsongkapa were to set forth how the Consequence group decides
the question of what is literal and what is figurative in the very same
section in which he is setting forth the unique position of Mind-Only
School on this same question, then he would be making the mistake of
confusing his sections.

examine the high word of the victorious Buddhas and come to a conclusion of
its total accuracy; whereas (2) it would be impossible for a person to undertake
a perfect, exhaustive examination of this high word and then confuse his
sections when he got to the part where he explained the positions of the
schools of the higher way.

fact that the fact that physical matter is what the term "physical matter" refers

Those sutras of the higher way which were taught during the
final period, and in which the Conqueror expressed his message
by taking--as the principal subject matter which he described--
either the subtle form of a lack of a self-nature to objects, the
grosser form, or both, intending the teaching for specific disciples
belonging to the higher way.

A prime example of this turning of the wheel would be sutras such as the
"Chapter Requested by the Bodhisattva Paramarta Samudgata"; the section of
the "Chapter Requested by Maitreya" from the Commentary on the True Intent
known as "Maitreya and the Reflection in which Single-Pointed Concentration
Plays."

The above are, by the way, only primary descriptions; if one were to eliminate
all the problematic wording in them carefully, then the definition of the first
stage of the teachings, the turning of the wheel of the Dharma where Lord
Buddha taught the four realized truths, would be:
A sutra of the lower way, whichever of the three turnings of the
wheel it belongs to.

The definition of the middle stage of the teachings, the turning of the wheel of
the Dharma where Lord Buddha taught that nothing exists by definition,
would be:
A sutra that (1) belongs to some one of the three turnings of the
wheel as described in the Commentary on the True Intent, and
which (2) was intended primarily for disciples belonging to the
greater way, but of the kind who did not require a re-
interpretation of the middle turning of the wheel through some
teaching like the "Chapter Requested by the Bodhisattva Parmarta
Samudgata."

The definition of the final stage of the teachings, the turning of the wheel of
the Dharma where the fine distinctions were made, would then be:
A sutra that (1) belongs to some one of the three turnings of the
wheel as described in the Commentary on the True Intent, and
which (2) was intended primarily for disciples belonging to the
greater way, and of the kind who did require a re-interpretation
of the middle turning of the wheel through some teaching like
the "Chapter Requested by the Bodhisattva Parmarta Samudgata."
Prime examples would be the same as above.

Now there is a reason why the sutra says that the specific disciples for whom
the final stage of the teachings, the turning of the wheel of the Dharma where
fine distinctions were made, were "those who had entered, perfectly, every one
of the different ways." The point is that the specific disciples for whom the
first wheel was turned are capable only of grasping the system of the three
attributes with regard to the version of the lack of a self-nature of persons that

was presented during the first turning of the wheel. They are not capable of
grasping the system of the three attributes with regard to the lack of a self-
nature of objects treated by the middle turning of the wheel.

Specific disciples for whom the middle wheel was turned are capable of
grasping the system of the three attributes with regard to the lack of a self-
nature of objects treated by the middle turning of the wheel with requiring any
re-interpretation of this middle turning by any other sutra.

Specific disciples for whom the final wheel was turned are not capable of
grasping the system of the three attributes with regard to the lack of a self-
nature of objects treated by the middle turning of the wheel without a re-
interpretation of this middle turning of the wheel through some teaching like
the "Chapter Requested by the Bodhisattva Paramarta Samudgata."

When we say that they "are immediately capable of grasping the system of the
three attributes with regard to the lack of a self-nature of objects treated by the
middle turning of the wheel if they do rely on a re-interpretation of this
middle turning of the wheel through some teaching like the "Chapter
Requested by the Bodhisattva Paramarta Samudgata," the implication is that
they are already a disciple who understands the system of the three attributes
with regard to the lack of a self-nature of the person presented during the first
turning of the wheel. And this is why the sutra speaks of those of "every one
of the different ways."

Course XV: What the Buddha Really Meant
Reading Seven: Master Asanga on Avoiding the Two Extremes
The following selection is taken from the Essence of Eloquence, a Classical
Commentary on Distinguishing between the Figurative and the Literal (Drang-
ba dang nges-pa'i don rnam-par 'byed-pa'i bstan-bcos Legs-bshad snying-po),
by Je Tsongkapa (1357-1419); ff. 14a-18a in the ACIP digital edition (catalog number
S5396), and pp. 34-44 in the ACIP Indian paper edition. The translation is based
upon an oral teaching of the text by Geshe Tupten Rinchen of Sera Mey Tibetan
Monastery. Please note that Je Tsongkapa's root text is extremely difficult, and is best
studied with the accompanying ACI tapes.

GNYIS PA LA GNYIS, SLOB DPON THOGS MED KYIS GTZO BOR DGONGS 'GREL LA BRTEN TSUL DANG , DE LA BRTEN NAS DE KHO NA NYID GTAN LA PHAB PA'I TSUL LO, ,
Here begins the second major part in our discussion of the art of interpretation
according to the Commentary on the True Intent; that is, an explanation of how
this sutra is commented upon. We proceed in two steps: a description of how
Master Asanga relies, primarily, on the Commentary; and a description of how
he sets forth the meaning of thusness, based on this approach.

Here is the first. In the Compendium, Master Asanga cites the chapters on the
ultimate from the Commentary on the True Intent, saying--
You should understand the ultimate as having five characteristics,
as described in the Commentary on the True Intent.
He also cites the chapters that treat the three attributes, in the words:
You should view the attributes of all existing things as these are
described in the Commentary on the True Intent.
He further cites the chapters on how things lack any nature of their very own,
the ones that relate topics like the question and the answer about apparent
inconsistencies in the sutras, and the distinction between teachings that are
figurative and those that are literal, like this:
You should view, for every existing thing, the characteristic of
lacking any nature of its own as described in the Commentary on
the True Intent.

DE BZHIN DU RNAM SHES TSOGS BRGYAD DANG MTHAR THUG RIGS NGES PA YANG DGONGS 'GREL NAS GSUNGS PA RNAMS DRANGS SO, ,
Master Asanga further refers to the idea of the group of eight different kinds
of consciousness, and the idea that--ultimately--there are three fixed tracks,
both as they are spoken in the Commentary on the True Intent.

BYANG SA'I DE KHO NA'I LE'U DANG DE'I RNAM PAR GTAN LA DBAB PA DANG THEG BSDUS LAS

In others of his works--in the "Chapter on Thusness" from the Levels of the
Bodhisattvas, in the treatise upon it, and in the Compendium as well--he makes
his presentation using a great number of explanations which come from the
Commentary on the True Intent: explanations which show how Lord Buddha
stated that totality consists of the absence of constructs relating to the basic
object and to its details, with regard to dependent things.

Consider too the presentations of thusness found in the Jewel of the Sutras, in
Distinguishing the Middle from the Extremes, and the various crucial points found
in the commentaries upon these texts. They also are in very close agreement
with the explanations found in our sutra, and so we can say that it appears
that setting forth the meaning of this sutra forms the very foundation of this
[Mind-Only] system.

Here secondly is our description of how Master Asanga sets forth the meaning
of thusness, based on this approach of relying primarily upon the Commentary
on the True Intent. Here there are three steps: a general presentation of how
one avoids the two extremes; a more detailed refutation of the extreme of
concocting things; and how here the distinction between the literal and
figurative teachings of Lord Buddha is drawn.

The first of these has three further sections: the way in which the Levels of the
Bodhisattva explains the point; the way in which the Compendium explains the
point; and how other texts explain it. The first of these has two parts of its
own: how a person who is concocting or discounting things views things, and
how we refute them.

Here is the first of these two parts. One may begin with the following
question:
The Levels of the Bodhisattva makes the following statement:
How then do things exist? They exist in a certain
way--in which they are free of the object of a
mistaken tendency to concoct things, a tendency
directed at something which doesn't in reality exist;
and in which they are free of the object of a
mistaken tendency to discount things, a tendency
directed at things which are in reality pure.
Can you explain what "concocting things" and "discounting
things" mean in this description that things exist in a way free of
concocting and discounting?

DE GNYIS NI BYANG SA LAS, GZUGS LA SOGS PA'I CHOS RNAMS DANG GZUGS LA SOGS PA'I DNGOS PO LA 'DOGS PA'I TSIG GI NGO BO NYID KYI RANG GI MTSAN NYID YOD PA MA YIN PA LA SGRO BTAGS NAS MNGON PAR ZHEN PA GANG YIN PA DANG , ZHES PA 'DIS SGRO 
'DOGS TSUL GSUNGS LA,
These two are explained in the Levels of the Bodhisattva as follows.
The way in which concocting things works was spoken to be like
this: it is that belief in which you concoct something about the
very nature of the words that are used to make constructions
concerning physical matter and all other existing objects, and
concerning physical matter and all other functioning things;
about words that are, in fact, things which do not exist by
definition.

BTAGS PA'I TSIG GI MTSAN MA'I GZHI BTAGS PA'I TSIG GI MTSAN MA'I RTEN DU GYUR PA, BRJOD DU MED PA'I BDAG NYID KYIS DON DAM PAR YOD PA YANG DAG PA'I DNGOS PO LA THAMS CAD KYI THAMS CAD DU MED DO ZHES SKUR BA 'DEBS SHING CHUD GZON PAR BYED PA GANG YIN PA 'DI GNYIS NI CHOS 'DUL BA 'DI LAS RAB TU NYAMS PA YIN PAR RIG PAR BYA'O, , ZHES PA SNGA MAS NI SKUR PA 'DEBS TSUL BSTAN LA CHUD GZON ZHES PA MAN CHAD KYIS NI THEG PA CHEN PO'I CHOS ZAB MO LAS NYAMS PAR BSTAN NO, ,
Discounting things is like this; it is saying that the following do
not, all in all, exist:
that which is the foundation, with the typical
features, of the words used to make constructs
--that which provides the basis, with the
characteristics, of the words used to make
constructs;
that which exists ultimately, through an identity
beyond all expression; and
that which is a pure, functioning thing.
They are, in short, things that waste one's opportunity; you
should understand that these two will cause you to fall from this
spiritual way of discipline.

The beginning part of this second section constitutes a description of what it
is to discount something; and the part including the words "waste one's
opportunity" on down is describing how a person would then fall from the
profound teaching of the greater way.

GZUGS ZHES PA NAS DNGOS PO LA ZHES PA'I BAR GYIS KUN BRTAGS 'DOGS PA'I GZHI BSTAN TE, DE LA 'DOGS PA'I TSIG GI NGO BO NYID CES PA NI TSIG GIS BTAGS PA'I NGO BO NYID LA BYA'I, 'DOGS BYED KYI TSIG LA MI BYA STE BSDU BA LA SOGS PA NAS GSAL BAR BSHAD DO, , BYANG SA'I SKABS GZHAN DU BYUNG BA RNAMS KYANG DE LTAR SHES PAR BYA'O, ,
The part that talks about "physical matter," continuing down to "functional
things," is describing the object towards which a construct is directed. The part
about "the very nature of the words that are used to make constructions"
should be understood as referring to the nature [or attribute] of constructs,
rather than to the words used in applying the constructs themselves; this point
is made quite clear in works like the Compendium. You should keep in mind
that--when this phrasing is used elsewhere in the Compendium as well--it
should be read this same way.

TSIG GIS BTAGS PA'I NGO BO DE NYID RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYIS YOD PA MIN PA LA DE'I RANG GI MTSAN NYID YOD DO ZHES ZHEN PA NI SGRO 'DOGS SO, ,
The act of concocting things then consists of a believing that this nature
constructed through the use of words--something which in fact does not exist
by definition--does exist by definition.

BTAGS PA'I TSIG GI MTSAN MA'I GZHI NI BTAGS PA'I TSIG GI MTSAN MA'I RTEN ZHES PAS BSHAD DE KUN BRTAGS KYI GDAGS GZHI'O, ,
The expression "that which is the foundation, with the typical features, of the
words used to make constructs" is explained by the expression "that which
provides the basis, with the typical features, of the words used to make
constructs": the point is that we are talking about the object towards which the
construct is directed.

DE NYID BRJOD DU MED PA'I TSUL KYI DON DAM PAR YOD PA LA THAMS CAD KYI THAMS CAD DU MED DO ZHES 'DZIN PA NI SKUR 'DEBS SO, ,
And the act of discounting things then consists of holding the idea that this
thing--which "exists ultimately," in a way which is "beyond all
expression"--"does not, all in all, exist."

DE LTAR BYAS NA KUN BRTAGS DON DAM PAR YOD DO, , ZHES PA NI SGRO 'DOGS DANG NGO BO NYID GZHAN GNYIS DON DAM PAR MED DO ZHES PA NI SKUR 'DEBS YIN TE, DANG PO KUN RDZOB DANG GZHAN GNYIS DON DAM PAR YOD PA'I PHYIR RO, ,
Given all this, concocting things is where you say, "Constructs exist ultimately";
and discounting things is something where you say, "The other two natures do
not exist ultimately." This is because the first of the three actually only exists
deceptively, whereas the other two exist ultimately.

DON DAM PAR YOD PA LA MED PAR LTA BSKUR 'DEBS SU BSHAD PA'I ZLAS DRANGS NA DON DAM PAR MED PA LA YOD PAR LTA BA SGRO 'DOGS SU BSHAD DGOS LA SKABS 'DIR KUN BRTAGS RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYIS YOD PAR 'DZIN PA LA SGRO 'DOGS SU GSUNGS KYIS DE DON DAM PAR YOD PAR 'DZIN PA TSIG GIS GSAL BAR MA BSTAN KYANG RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYIS YOD NA DON DAM PAR YOD PA GZHUNG GI DON YIN PAS KUN BRTAGS DON DAM PAR YOD PA SGRO 'DOGS SU 'GRO BA'I PHYOGS SO, ,
If we explain discounting things as being the view that something which in
actuality does exist ultimately doesn't exist at all, then it would seem that we'd
have to explain concocting things as being the converse; that is, as the view
that something which in actuality does not exist ultimately, does exist. The
position stated at this point though is that concocting things consists of holding
that constructs exist by definition--which means holding them to exist
ultimately. So although it's not stated clearly in the actual wording, the point
of the text here is that--if something exists by definition--then it exists
ultimately. Holding that constructs exist ultimately then, according to this
view, constitutes the act of concocting things.

DGONGS 'GREL LAS, KUN BRTAGS PA'I MTSAN NYID KYI GNAS 'DU BYED KYI MTSAN MA NGO BO DANG KHYAD PAR DU 'DOGS PA'I GZHI GZHAN DBANG LA GSUNGS PAS, GZHUNG 'DIS BTAGS PA'I TSIG GI MTSAN MA'I GZHI DON DAM PAR YOD PA LA MED CES GSUNGS PA'I DNGOS BSTAN GZHAN DBANG YIN MOD KYANG , DE DON DAM PAR MED NA YONGS GRUB KYANG DON DAM DU MED PAR 'GYUR BAS GNYIS KA LA BSHAD PA LA SKYON MED DE   
Remember that the Commentary on the True Intent describes dependent things
as "the object of the attribute of constructs; that which exhibits the typical
features of a factor; and the object for applying constructs about the basic
nature and the other features of a thing." We would have to admit, therefore,
that when this text mentions holding that the "foundation, with the typical
features, of the words used to make constructs" (something which in truth
exists ultimately) doesn't exist, then what it is referring to explicitly is
dependent things. There's no problem though if we say that the text is in
effect speaking both of dependent things and totality, since--if dependent
things were something that didn't exist ultimately--then totality would have
to be something that didn't exist ultimately either.

   BYANG SA LAS, GZUGS LA SOGS PA'I CHOS RNAMS KYI DNGOS PO TZAM LA SKUR PA 'DEBS PA LA NI DE KHO NA YANG MED LA 'DOGS PA YANG MED DE DE GNYIS KA YANG MI RIGS SO, , ZHES GSUNGS PA'I PHYIR TE DNGOS PO GZHAN DBANG LA SKUR PA 'DEBS TSUL NI THA SNYAD DU MED DO ZHES PA'AM SPYIR MED DO ZHES PA MIN GYI SNGAR GONG DU DON DAM PAR YOD PA LA MED CES PA SKUR 'DEBS SU GSUNGS PA LTAR RO, ,
This idea is supported by the Levels of the Bodhisattva, where it says:
If you discount objects like physical matter and other such objects
that are functional things in themselves, you are still relegating
thusness as well to the realm of non-existence, and it too would
be something that didn't exist at all. And both these views would
be equally wrong.

Thus we can say that the way in which a person discounts functional things,
dependent things, is not where they say "They don't exist in a normal way" or
"They don't exist at all," but rather where they say, as described above, that
something which does in fact exist ultimately does not.

Here is the second point, on how we refute the views in which a person either
concocts things or discounts things. One may begin with the following
question:
If that's what it means to either concoct things or to discount
things, how then do we avoid falling into these views?
The extreme of concocting things is prevented by demonstrating how any
object you choose to take at all is devoid of having a construct about it (either
one about its basic nature or one about its various features) that could exist
ultimately. We will cover this in greater detail later on.

PAR 'GYUR RO ZHES GSUNGS PAS BKAG GO,
Preventing the view in which you discount things is accomplished through the
following words of the Levels of the Bodhisattva:
The citation given just after that, and the one immediately
subsequent, make the following point. If for example the various
heaps of physical matter and the rest do exist, then it is
appropriate for us to apply the construct of person to them. If
however you believed that they did not exist, then we could
never apply the construct of person to them, since one could
hardly speak this way of something that was not a thing.
By the same token, whenever the objects of physical matter and
the like--functional things in themselves--do exist, then it is
appropriate for us to apply the labels of "physical matter" and
such to them. If however one believed that they did not exist,
then we could never apply a construct to them with some
constructing kinds of words; they would be something that was
not a thing. If one thus held that there existed no basis to apply
a construct to, then--since there were no basis for
construction--there would be no constructs either.

Who is the opponent in this case; who is it that would even accept the idea of
discounting things that we are disproving here? There's no reason why it
would be some non-Buddhist school, nor would it be one of the listener
groups, since none of them would ever assert that the functional things of
physical matter and the rest that provide the foundation for applying
expressions--both in names and terms--did not exist by definition.

Therefore they are, as explained in the Compendium, a school that professes the
tenets of the greater way; and are moreover the ones who assert that nothing
that exists exists by definition. In short, we are talking about the "school that
says nothing has any nature"; [that is, the Middle-Way School.]

DE DAG GIS NI GZHAN DBANG LA SOGS PA'I CHOS RNAMS SPYIR MI SRID PA DANG THA SNYAD DU MED CES 'DOD PA GTAN MIN PAS DON DAM PAR MA GRUB CES SMRA'O, ,
This school, by the way, in no way believes that the objects represented by
dependent things and the like cannot exist, or that they do not exist in a
nominal way. What they do say is that none of these things exists in an
ultimate way.

Therefore the denial contained in the words "if functional things in themselves
did not exist" is, as explained before, a denial of the idea that pure functional
things, which do exist ultimately, could never exist. And this is true because,
in this system, it is not the case that--just because they do not exist by
definition and do not exist ultimately--constructs cannot exist at all. It is
though the case here that if any of the other two natures were something that
did not exist ultimately, or something that did not exist by definition, then they
could not exist at all.

The way this system thinks about it is as follows. Consider the growing of
several dependent things: mind and mental functions, arising as they do from
their particular causes and conditions. If their growth is thus something that
exists by definition, then it is an ultimate kind of growth. If this were not the
case, then their growth would merely be something constructed in the mind,
something where you just made it up in your own thoughts and said "they
grow." And in this case, the growth of the functional things represented by
mind and mental functions wouldn't be something that existed at all.

Don't respond to us then by saying that--since the growing and stopping of
dependent things is only something that exists to a mistaken state of mind
which is imagining that things are growing and stopping--growing and
stopping are things that exist, in a deceptive way; and that therefore there is
no discounting of these things occurring here.

Suppose you said something like "A rope is a snake to a mistaken state of
mind which is imagining the rope to be a snake, but generally speaking there's
never been a rope that was a snake." This is exactly what you're saying here

too: "The causes and effects involved in dependent things are causes and
effects to a mistaken state of mind, to the state of mind in which you hold
causes and effects to exist truly, but they are not causes and effects for
dependent things as such." You may say this is what you believe, but it
doesn't release you from the charge of discounting things; there is no way then
you can set forth the laws of karma and its consequences: the fact that pleasure
and pain, respectively, come from good and bad deeds.

And if you believe in the other king of cause and effect, they think in this
school, then it has to be cause and effect which exists by definition, and which
is then something which exists ultimately. They say therefore that--since if
there's no constructing if there's nothing to apply the construct to--then neither
of these two ideas could ever be true: that every existing object is simply a
construct of the mind, and that this is the point behind the meaning of
thusness. They would therefore explain these ideas as being the most
dangerous of all versions of the viewpoint that everything must have stopped
altogether.

As the Levels of the Bodhisattvas says,
As such there are certain people who, first of all, listened to these
sutras--difficult to grasp as they are; sutras which are tied to the
greater way, and which describe the true intent of that profound
object, emptiness. But they failed to understand the points
explained in these sutras properly, correctly. And then they made
up something, they got some idea that was inspired by wrong
reasoning, and said that all these things were nothing more than
something constructed by the mind. Then they went on and
explained this as the meaning of thusness. So the ones we are
talking about are anyone who says that seeing things this way is
the right way to see things; anyone who actually thinks this way,
and anyone who teaches it this way.

According to them, not even the very foundation to which we
apply our constructs -- functional things in themselves -- is
something that exists. And constructing itself then would be
something that didn't, all in all, exist either. How on earth then
could suchness, in the form of everything being a construct, exist
either? As such those who purport this idea are, according to
their own beliefs, guilty of discounting both thusness and the
idea of constructs. And you should understand that--since their
viewpoint is one which discounts both the idea of concepts and
thusness--it is the most dangerous of all those views that nothing
exists.

It's with this fact in mind that the Levels of the Bodhisattvas has said that:
It's been said that "believing in a self-existent person is no
problem compared to having a wrong idea about emptiness."
The point here is that the former is simply a lack of awareness
about knowable things; it does not represent a view in which you
discount every knowable object--it is not an act that would
throw you to a birth in the hell realms. The other kind of view
is not one which would destroy your spiritual aspirations; nor is
it one which would cause you to stray from the foundation of the
rules. The latter though functions in the exact opposite way.

As such, we can say that whatever a thing lacks, that thing is empty of; and
whatever's left over is something that exists. And when you see things this
way, it means that you are engaged in an unerring understanding of
emptiness.

The meaning of the first part of the statement just given, says the Levels of the
Bodhisattvas, is that all functional things--physical matter and the rest--are
devoid or empty of any essential nature of being constructed by words.
"Whatever's left over is something that exists" refers to the existence of those
functional things in themselves which act as the foundation to which constructs
are applied, and the constructing itself. The thing which things are empty of
is constructs; the basis or object which is empty is dependent things; and the
fact that the latter is empty of the former is totality. Saying that these things
either do or do not exist has the meaning described before.

When you are able to avoid this extreme view of concocting things, then you
are able to avoid the extreme view of "thinking that things exist." When you
are able to avoid the extreme view of discounting things, then you are able to
avoid the extreme view of "thinking that things don't exist." And then you will
have also delineated "indivisibility" [or emptiness].

And it is just this kind of emptiness which is explained as being the final form
of the ultimate: the Levels of the Bodhisattva says that--
"Indivisibility" is that object which is incorporated in the nature
of phenomena which is free of the existence and lack of existence
of the two: of the object of the former thing [of concocting things]
and of asserting that things don't exist [of discounting things].
And this kind of indivisibility is what we call the "matchless"
object of the path of the middle way, the way which avoids both
the extremes.

Reality
The following selection is taken from the Essence of Eloquence, a Classical
Commentary on Distinguishing between the Figurative and the Literal (Drang-
ba dang nges-pa'i don rnam-par 'byed-pa'i bstan-bcos Legs-bshad snying-po),
by Je Tsongkapa (1357-1419); ff. 18a-21a in the ACIP digital edition (catalog number
S5396), and pp. 44-51 in the ACIP Indian paper edition. The translation is based
upon an oral teaching of the text by Geshe Tupten Rinchen of Sera Mey Tibetan
Monastery. Please note that Je Tsongkapa's root text is extremely difficult, and is best
studied with the accompanying ACI tapes.

GNYIS PA LA GNYIS, PHYOGS SNGA MA DGOD CING DE'I DON LA DRIS LAN BYA BA DANG , LAN BTAB PA'I PHYOGS DGAG PA'O, ,
Here next is how the Compendium explains the point of how to avoid the two
extremes. We proceed in three steps: a presentation of the opponent position,
some questions and answers concerning this position, and a refutation of these
answers.

DANG PO NI, BSDU BA LAS, THEG PA CHEN PO PA LA LA RANG GIS NYES PAR BZUNG BAS 'DI SKAD CES KUN RDZOB TU NI THAMS CAD YOD LA DON DAM PAR NI THAMS CAD MED DO ZHES ZER RO, , ZHES GSUNGS TE, CHOS KUN DON DAM PAR NI MED LA THA SNYAD DU YOD PA'O ZHES SMRA BA'I DBU MA PA RNAMS KYIS CHOS RNAMS KYI YOD MED KYI KHYAD PAR PHYE BA BRJOD PA'O, ,
Here is the first. The Compendium includes a section that says:
Some followers of the greater way, intent on continuing to hold
to their errors, make this claim:
In a deceptive way, it is true that all things exist.
Ultimately though nothing exists.
These are the followers of the Middle Way, who speak of some
distinction between different ways in which all things both do
exist and don't exist, saying, "No single existing thing exists
ultimately; and every one of them does exist nominally."

DE NAS DE LA 'DI SKAD CES TSE DANG LDAN PA DON DAM PA NI GANG YIN KUN RDZOB NI GANG YIN ZHES BRJOD PAR BYA'O, ,
And when they say this we reply to them with the following
question:
Then we ask you, venerable sirs, what does it mean
to be "ultimate"? And what does it mean to be
"deceptive"?

And suppose they answer like this--
"Ultimate" refers to that thing which is the lack of
a self-nature that every existing object exhibits.
"Deceptive" refers to that thing which is the
tendency to see all these objects--which in truth
have no nature of their own--as having some
nature of their own.

And why is that? Because this tendency focuses on
things that don't even exist and creates a deception,
and makes up something, and declares something
to be, and creates an expression.
This would describe how our opponents would answer if you
asked them what the two truths were.

Here the question that is posed--"What does 'ultimate' mean?"--is one in
which we are asking for a typical example of ultimate truth. It is not though
a question about the "ultimate" that we say doesn't exist when we say that
nothing existing ultimately; not a question about how something isn't. If it
were, then it would be a mistake to answer that "ultimate" referred to the fact
that no existing thing has a self-nature; and this is because, when those of the
Middle Way say that something exists "as the ultimate," meaning "as the lack
of self-existence exhibited by all things," this is not at all what they mean when
they talk about something that could exist ultimately.

The question about "What does it mean to be 'deceptive'?" is as well a question
about the state of mind to which something can be established as what we call
"deceptive truth"; it is not a question about the "nominal" we speak of when
we say that things exist "nominally." If it were, then it would be incorrect to
speak of the "deceptive" where you hold that things have some nature of their
own when--in fact--they have no such nature. Remember, this is the tendency
to hold things as being true: and those of the Middle Way would say that the
thing it believes in doesn't even have any nominal existence. And this is
because, when you speak of things "not having any self-nature," the self-nature
that you say things don't have has to be referring to a kind of self-nature
which is absent: to a self-nature that existed truly.

GNYIS PA LA GNYIS, GZHAN GYI GRUB MTHA' LA 'GAL BA BSTAN PA DANG , RANG GI GRUB MTHA' LA 'GAL BA SPANG BA'O, ,
Here secondly are some questions and answers concerning the position stated.
We begin with a demonstration of inconsistencies in the other school's
positions, and go on to a demonstration that our own positions are free of any
inconsistency.

Here is the first. This next section starts with a refutation of how the other
school has identified the idea of the "deceptive." On this point, the
Compendium says:
And then we would say to them the following:

Consider this tendency to see things as having
some nature of their own. Are you asserting that it
is something which comes from certain causes
which are a "declaration" and which are deceptive?
Or are you asserting that it is something which is a
declaration itself, or a deceptive object itself?

If your answer is that it is something which comes
from certain cases which are a "declaration" and
which are deceptive, then it would be wrong for
you to state that "Because it is something which
comes from certain causes which are a declaration
and which are deceptive, it is not something which
exists."

GAL TE MNGON PAR BRJOD PA DANG KUN RDZOB TZAM ZHIG YIN NA NI DES NA GZHI MED PAR MNGON PAR BRJOD PA DANG KUN RDZOB CES BYAR MI RUNG NGO ZHES GSUNGS SO, ,
And if your answer is that it is a declaration itself,
a deceptive object itself, then since there would be
nothing to call them we could never even speak of
something being a "declaration" or "deceptive."

Here is the meaning of the citation. Consider the deceptive which focusses on
things which ultimately have no nature of their own and thinks to itself "they

do have some nature of their own." It too becomes a declaration within
you--and when it does, the question is whether it is something which has
grown out of a similar, previous case; or whether it is something which is
merely constructed by ideas which are deceptive and declarations.

Suppose you say that the first is the case. The part about "It would be wrong
to state that, because it is something which comes from certain causes, it is not
something which exists" means "it is not something which exists ultimately,"
since in the context here the argument is over whether or not things exist
ultimately, and because the opponent has never said that, in general, nothing
exists--but rather accepts the position that nothing exists ultimately.

Suppose you say that the second is the way it is; in this case then it would be
wrong to say that things were just constructs of our projections. And this
would be true because there would nothing to which they could refer: if the
deceptive and declaration were merely constructs of our projections, then the
rest would become that way as well.

Here next is the refutation of how the other school has identified the idea of
the "ultimate." On this, the same work states:
And then we say to them,
And why is it, venerable sirs, that what we see
doesn't exist?
And suppose they answer like this--
Because it is something which is mistaken.
We would then continue on and ask them:
Are you asserting that this mistaken thing is
something which exists, or is it something which
does not exist?

If you say that it does exist, then it would be wrong
for you to say that "the fact that no existing thing
has any nature of its own is the ultimate." If you
say that it does not exist, then it would be wrong
for you to say that "because it is something which
is mistaken, what it sees doesn't have any nature of
its own."

The point being expressed here is the following:
How could it ever be correct to say--even as you observe
examples of things which exist by definition--that they don't?
This is disproved by our own valid perception that these same
things exist in this very way.

And suppose you say that "our position is not disproved by a

Our answer then would be,
Well now, if this mistaken thing is itself something
which exists by definition, then it would be wrong
to say that the fact that nothing has its own nature
is what the "ultimate" refers to. And if on the other
hand it didn't exist, then it would be incorrect to
say "Because it is mistaken, then what it sees
doesn't exist."

We should admittedly in this case too go through the exercise of examining
whether we are talking about existing or not existing, or doing so ultimately;
but because the meaning is the same and because the point is easily
understood from the previous examination, the section is written this way.

Consider the fact that, in this particular citation, no statement is made
criticizing the idea that the pair of constructs and totality are not things which
exist ultimately, but do exist nominally. The criticism is rather made through
examining the question of whether a deceptive state of mind, and a mistaken
state of mind, exist ultimately or not. The point of this approach is to refute
the idea that dependent things could be something which did not exist
ultimately, but which did exist deceptively. These dependent things are the
things that exhibit the quality of totality; they are the ones that apply the
constructs; and they too are what the constructs are applied to. And so these
are what real thinkers take, primarily, as their subject when they argue about
whether things exist ultimately or not.

Moreover, the Compendium says:
You should understand that any tendency where you focus on
the nature known as "dependent things" and the nature known
as "totality" and imagine them to be the nature known as
"constructs" constitutes the extreme view of concocting things.

And the extreme view of discounting things consists of any
tendency where you focus on the nature known as "dependent
things" and the nature known as "totality"--things that actually
do exist--and say that they don't; this is discounting all those
things which exist be definition. And so it is that you must come
to a grasp of the actual meaning of thusness: by means of
avoiding these two extreme views.

The point of this citation is that--when you focus on the first and final two of
the three natures, on the two that exist by definition, and say that they do not
exist this way--then you are discounting all the actual examples of things that
exist by definition. This text and the Levels of the Bodhisattva are exactly the
same on the question of what the extreme views of concocting things and
discounting things consist of, and on how we go about avoiding them.

exist ultimately, not those that exist nominally. As the Compendium says,
One may ask the following question:

Consider constructed ideas, whether they are put
together with names or with verbalizations. Are
you saying that they have some existing nature, or
are you rather saying that they have no existing
nature?
And we answer with the following:
What we are saying is that--from a nominal point
of view--they do have an existing nature. And
what we are saying is that--ultimately speaking--
they have no existing nature.

It also speaks of "that thing which is the nature that we call 'constructs': the
object of that consciousness which relies on names coming from a state of
habituation with the declarations"; and then goes on to say that "these do have
a constructed existence, but are not things that exist ultimately."

And so--despite the fact that the constructs represented by the two kinds of
"self-nature" are something which is a total impossibility--it doesn't necessarily
follow that all constructs are impossibilities. Therefore we can at one moment
deny that things could exist substantially or that they could exist ultimately,
and yet still posit that they do exist in a projected way, in a nominal way.

As such the following ideas, presented in a number of major commentaries to
the Commentary on the True Intent, do not represent the true intent of this sutra:
the idea that constructs are something which exist with regard to
neither of the two truths;
the idea that dependent things--whether represented by objects
of the mind or by the states of mind which perceive these
objects--are something that exists only in a deceptive way, given
the fact that their dependent origination is something which has
been compared to an illusion; and
the idea that totality is something ultimate, but something
ultimate in the sense of existing as a thing that has no self-nature.

These ideas contradict the presentation in the Summary of the Greater Way
which quotes the Commentary on the True Intent to show that external objects
don't exist, and then goes on to explain that the idea of outer and inner
things--seeing things as objects and subjects--is a construct. They also
contradict both the Levels of the Bodhisattva and the Compendium; moreover, the
fact that they quote lines from Gaining a True Understanding of Valid Perception
[written by Master Dharmakirti hundreds of years later] shows that the claim
made by some that they were written by Master Asanga is a gross failure to
check the facts.

Moreover, the great majority of the chapters in the Commentary on the True
Intent--all except for the chapter on the circumstances of the teaching--are
quoted directly in the Compendium, and difficult points in them resolved quite
thoroughly. And so there wouldn't appear any great need for the Master to
have composed another, separate commentary.

There have been others later on too who explained the true intent of the
pair--of Master Asanga and his brother--in the following way:
The first of the three natures doesn't even exist nominally.
The middle one of the three natures exists nominally, but doesn't
exist ultimately.
The last of the three natures exists ultimately.
People like this too have wandered out of this system.

Consider especially the position that--when we speak of dependent things as
existing nominally--what we mean is that a mistaken state of mind merely
imagines that growing and stopping apply to them; and that qualities like
growing and stopping don't even exist with functional things. This is the most
extreme possible version of discounting dependent things, and for this reason
it moreover constitutes discounting the other two natures as well. Being
therefore a discounting of all three of the attributes, it is exactly the viewpoint
which the Levels of the Bodhisattva mentioned above as being the primary form
of the view that all things have stopped. You should finally understand that
this is idea would be an inescapable contradiction for anyone who held the
position that the Commentary on the True Thought was meant literally.

Course XV: What the Buddha Really Meant
Reading Nine: Interpretations of the Independent Group of the
Middle-Way School
There is no one section of Je Tsongkapa's root text on the Essence of Eloquence that
easily presents all the concepts of the Independent group of the Middle-Way School on
the subjects covered in the course so far. We therefore begin a group of selections,
many from monastic textbooks, which together give us a good overview of the relevant
ideas.
The first part of the reading helps understand the differences between the Independent
group, the Mind-Only School, and the Consequence group on the question of whether
things exist from their own sides, with their own unique identities. The selection is
taken from the Overview of the Perfection of Wisdom (Phar-phyin spyi-don) of
Master Kedrup Tenpa Dargye (1493-1568), from the glorious Sera Mey Tibetan
Monastery (ACIP electronic text catalog number SL0009, Part One, folios 12a-13b).
Remember that most of the descriptions of "our own system" refer to that of the
Independent group!

Therefore the following is the final form of the idea denied by the reasoning
which examines the ultimate:
Anything which existed from its own side with its own unique
identity, rather than being simply established as existing by
appearing to an unaffected state of mind.

And this is true because the final form of the way in which physical matter
and all other existing objects exist deceptively is through their being
established as existing by a state of mind which is unaffected by short-term
circumstances that would cause it to make an error.

GZUGS SOGS KYI CHOS RNAMS 'JOG BYED KYI BLO DE 'PHRAL GYI 'KHRUL RGYUS MA BSLAD PA DGOS SHING PHUGS KYI 'KHRUL RGYUS MA BSLAD PA NI MI DGOS TE,
When we describe the state of mind which can establish that physical matter
and all other existing objects exist, it is necessarily one which is not affected by
some short-term circumstances which would cause it to make an error; it is not
the case though that it would have to be a state of mind which was not
affected by some long-term circumstances.

And this is because it is not the case that--when physical matter and other
such existing objects appear to be things that exist by definition--this
appearance is not something which is affected neither by short-term nor by
long-term circumstances; and because it involves being affected by the innate
form of the tendency to hold things as existing truly.

Here we will explain how this school decides what the two realities are, using
some metaphors as well. Two things have to be present with all of these
objects: with physical matter and every other existing thing. From the point
of view of what appears in the world, they must be established as existing
from our side--merely by virtue of their appearing to an unaffected state of
mind. From the point of view of emptiness, they must be void of any kind of
existence where the object exists from its own side through its own unique
identity, rather than by virtue of its appearing to an unaffected state of mind.

And so two things have to come together for a functional thing like a sprout:
it must be established as existing by virtue of appearing to an unaffected state
of mind; and the sprout should exist from its own side through some identity.
 DANG PO DGOS TE, DE MI DGOS NA, MYU GU LA MYU GU ZHES PA'I MING MA THOGS PA'I GANG ZAG GI NGOR YANG , MYU GU MYU GUR GRUB DGOS PA'I PHYIR,
The first is necessary since--if it were not--then a sprout would have to be a
sprout even to a person who had never been introduced to the idea that the
sprout was called a "sprout."

PHYI MA DGOS TE, DE MI DGOS NA, RI BONG GI RVA ZHES PA'I MING GIS BZHAG PA TZAM DANG , RI BONG GI RVA ZHES RTOG PAS BZUNG BA TZAM DANG MTSUNGS PAR 'GYUR BA'I PHYIR,
The latter is necessary since--if it were not--then a sprout would be a sprout
in exactly the same way as the horn of a rabbit is the horn of a rabbit: merely
because we called it the "horn of a rabbit," or just because we imagined
something called the "horn of a rabbit."

Consider, by the way, the word "merely" when we speak of physical matter
and all other existing objects as being "things which are established as existing
merely by virtue of their appearing to an unaffected state of mind." Its use is
meant to disallow the idea that these things could be established by virtue of
some unique identity of the object itself, rather than being established as
existing by virtue of this appearing. It is not however meant to disallow the
idea that things do not exist merely through names and terms.

And this is true because, as the Perfect Explanation, an Illumination of the True
Thought, has a part where it states--
Given the fact that those who belong to this school accept the
idea that physical matter and all other existing objects do possess
an identity that is not established merely through names and
terms . . .

Now there is a metaphor which we can use for the idea that physical matter
and all other existing objects are established as existing from our side--merely
by virtue of their appearing to an unaffected state of mind, and for the idea
that these objects exist through some identity of their own.

Think of a case where a magician makes a stick of wood appear as a horse or
cow. Two things have to be present here. First of all, the appearance of a
horse or cow there around the stick is something that is established as existing
by virtue of the minds of the people whose eyes are affected by the magic
words and powder, from their side. Secondly, an appearance must also be
something coming from the side of the stick.

The first requirement, being established as existing by virtue of the minds of
the people whose eyes are affected by the magic words and powder, is
necessary since--if it were not--then those in the audience whose eyes were
not affected by the magic words and powder would have to see this
appearance, whereas they do not.

In this same situation it is also necessary for the horse or cow to be appearing
from the stick's side as well, since--if they were not--then the appearance of
a horse or cow would have to occur even in a place where there were no stick;
whereas it does not.

Physical matter--and all other existing objects--are similar, in that they are
established as existing by an unaffected state of mind; and this is because they
are constructed by virtue of an unaffected state of mind and names that fit.

They do not, however, exist from their own side through some unique identity
of their own, without being established as existing by virtue of appearing to
an unaffected state of mind. This is because--if they were to exist this
way--then they would have to be some ultimate nature. And if they were
some ultimate nature, then they would have to be something which is
perceived directly by a certain unmistaken state of mind: that meditative
wisdom of a realized being who is not yet a Buddha, and who perceives the
real nature of things directly. The fact is though that they are not.

In this situation, where a magician makes a stick appear as a horse or cow, two
things apply to the members of the audience whose eyes are affected by the
magic words and powder: the stick is appearing as a horse or cow, and they
believe that it is.

The only condition that applies to the magician himself is that a horse or cow
is appearing to him; he does not believe in them. And those members of the
audience who showed up later--those whose eyes were not affected by the
magic words or powder--have neither the horse or cow appearing to them, nor
any belief in the horse or cow. These same three different permutations apply
as well to physical matter and all the other existing objects.

Consider "common" people: those who have not yet had their first experience
of the perception of emptiness. Both situations apply to them for physical
matter and all other existing objects: these things appear to them to exist truly,
and they believe in the way they appear.

Consider now bodhisattvas who have reached one of the pure levels. Even
though objects appear to their minds, during what we call the "subsequent
period," as something which exists truly, they have no belief in them this way.
And this is because neither situation applies to realized beings who are not yet
Buddhas and who are perceiving the real nature of things directly; that is,
physical matter and other objects do not appear to them as if they existed
truly, and they do not believe that these objects exist that way.

The Consequence and Independent groups of the Middle-Way School hold the
same belief about the following things; both schools hold them to be what is
denied by the reasoning which examines the ultimate:

a thing that could exist truly;
a thing that could exist purely;
a thing that could exist as thusness;
a thing that could exist ultimately; and
the thought where you hold that anything could exist
in any of these ways.

The Independent group does not however agree that the following are what
is denied by the reasoning which examines the ultimate:
a thing that existed from its own side;
a thing that existed by nature;
a thing that existed as a substantial thing;
a thing that existed by definition; and
the thought where you hold that anything like physical matter or the
rest could exist this way.

And this is true because they believe that--if something exists--it must
necessarily exist as the three left over after you exclude a thing that existed as
a substantial thing. There is some discussion about the status of constructs; but
they believe that, if something is a functional thing, it must exist as a
substantial thing.

Neither those who follow the Consequence system, nor those who follow the
Independent system, accept that any of the following could be the final form
of the idea denied by the reasoning which examines the ultimate:
a thing that existed as the way things really are;
a thing that existed as ultimate reality; and
a thing that existed as the real nature of things.

DON DAM BDEN PA YIN NA DE GSUM DU GRUB PAS KHYAB PA'I PHYIR TE,

And this is true first of all because the Perfect Explanation, an Illumination of the
True Thought, states that--when the commentary to the Sixty Verses of Reasoning
describes nirvana as deceptive reality--what it means is that nirvana must be
established as existing as ultimate reality with reference to a deceived state of
mind. Distinguishing between the Figurative and the Literal also states that the real
nature of things exists as the real nature of things; and Opening the Eyes of the
Good and Fortune states that it doesn't automatically mean that something exists
ultimately just because it exists as the real nature of things.

It would be correct to say then that there is a difference in subtlety between the
Consequence and Independent versions of the final form of the idea denied by
the reasoning which examines the ultimate. This is true first of all because the
Independent group accepts the concept that things can exist by definition,
through their accepting the concepts of an independent logical reason; of
something that could grow from something other than itself; and of something
that could exist as a substantial thing.

The idea is moreover supported by the manner in which the schools explain
the concept of what is literal and what is figurative. Master Bhavaviveka denies
extensively the idea that the Mind-Only School explains the true intent of the
middle turning of the wheel to be the concept that constructs do not exist by
definition. And when Shantarakshita and his spiritual son explain the way in
which the final turning of the wheel comments upon the middle turning, they
explain it as meaning that constructs do not exist by definition in an ultimate
way, but do exist by definition in a nominal way.
************
The following selection is drawn from the same text, the Overview of the Perfection
of Wisdom (Part Five, ff. 9a-10a). It gives an idea of how valid the Consequence
group considers the division of selflessness into three differing degrees of subtlety:

DBU MA THAL 'GYUR BA RNAMS NI GANG ZAG DANG CHOS KYI BDAG MED GNYIS DAG STONG GZHI KHO NA'I SGO NAS 'JOG GIS DGAG BYA PHRA RAGS KYI SGO NAS MI 'JOG, 'DIR NI GNYIS KA'I SGO NAS 'JOG,
The Consequence group of the Middle-Way School draws a distinction between
the lack of a self-nature of persons and of things, but only relative to the thing
it is which is empty of them; they do not however make any distinction
between more or less subtle versions of what it is we deny by the reasoning
which examines the ultimate. Here in the Independent School though they
recognize both these distinctions.

And it is relative to this fact that they can say it's not necessarily the case that
something is devoid of existing as a self-standing, substantial object if it
exhibits the qualities of growing and stopping. They would also say that, just
because something is a person, it's not necessarily the case that it is then
devoid of this same kind of existence. And this is because both are disproved
by the example of consciousness of the thought.

If something exhibits the qualities of growing and
stopping, it cannot be something which exists as a
self-standing, substantial object;
Because if something were the self-nature of a person it
could never be something which exhibited the
qualities of growing and stopping.
And this is true because, if something were this kind of a
self-nature, it would have to be something which
were unchanging, singular, and independent.

Consider the fresh, unerring state of mind which grows from this type of
reasoning, and which perceives a kind of emptiness which is the fact that the
person is devoid of being a self-standing, substantial object. This is a deductive
form of valid perception which has realized the lack of a self-nature to the
person, and we describe it as being a realization of an emptiness which has
grown from contemplation.

GNYIS PA LA, DE RTOGS PA'I SGOM BYUNG GI RNAL 'BYOR GYI DON DE NYID GTZO BOR ZHI LHAG ZUNG 'BREL GYI SGO NAS RTZE GCIG TU SGOM PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Here is the second division, concerning deep practice based on meditation; we
describe it as a kind of realization which grows from meditation: one in which
a person engaged in deep practice meditates single-pointedly on this same
object, utilizing primarily a combination of quietude and vision.

Now for the third division, the result of this meditation. There is such a result,
because directly speaking one eliminates the manifest form of the learned
tendency to hold to a self-nature of persons. The meditation also acts to lower
the gross power of the innate tendency.

We have the same three divisions, of reasoning based on contemplation and
so on, for the second level of deep practice. Here is the first.
Consider the color blue.

It is something which is devoid of being of a separate
substance from the valid perception which
perceives it;
Because it is invariably found in combination with it.
They are, for example, like your awareness in a dream and anger
that you may feel during the dream.
You can understand the remaining details, of the deductive perception and so
on, from the preceding presentation.

GNYIS PA SGOM BYUNG GI RNAL 'BYOR YOD DE, DON DE NYID ZHI LHAG ZUNG 'BREL GYI RTZE GCIG TU SGOM PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
As for the second, there is a deep practice here that grows from
meditation--for it would be the single-pointed meditation, combining both
quietude and vision, focussed on this particular object.

GSUM PA BSGOMS PA'I 'BRAS BU YOD DE, LAS SU GZUNG 'DZIN RDZAS THA DAD DU 'DZIN PA'I RTOG PA MNGON GYUR SPANGS TE, GNYIS SNANG 'KHRUL BAR KHONG DU CHUD BAR BYED PA'I PHYIR,
The third, the result of the meditation, is also here: for its work,* it eliminates
the manifest form of the thought that objects and the subject states of mind
which perceive them are of a separate substance; and this is the case because
one has grasped the fact that the state of mind that perceives a disparity is
mistaken.
[*The Tibetan reading here may be a mistake for DNGOS SU, or "directly speaking."]

The third--that is, the level of deep practice in which one perceives emptiness
itself--also comes in three divisions. Here is the first.

Consider the state of mind which is "free of the two."
It is not something which exists truly,
Because it is an example of dependent origination.
It is, for example, like an illusion.
The latter two details follow.

The next selection is also taken from the Overview (Part Five, f. 3b), and gives an
insight into how the Independent group views the function of meditating upon the
three degrees of selflessness.

"Well then," you may think to yourself, "how do we in our own position
describe the process by which one eliminates the various impurities?" It has
been taught that:
One can gain the ability to put a total end to the three--that is,
to the obstacles of the mental afflictions, to the gross obstacles to
omniscience, and to the subtle obstacles to omniscience--if one
meditates with that wisdom which grows from meditation and
which sees directly the three degrees of the lack of a self-nature;
this itself grows from following the practices of study and
meditation to come to an understanding of these three.

Given this statement, it is not the case that in our own position we believe--as
do those who assert the existence of functional things which exist truly--that
one can eliminate impurities that one asserts exist in truth. The citation rather
is demonstrating the principal tenet of how our own system describes the
process of eliminating the two obstacles; that is, that we eliminate impurities
by meditating upon how these same impurities lack any true existence.
************
The next selection introduces, briefly, the concept of the three levels of deep practice
that correlate to the three degrees of selflessness. It is taken from The "Cloud of
Offerings, which Pleases the Wise, and Illuminates the True Thought of the
Treatise known as the 'Ornament of Realizations,'" being a Combined Word
Commentary and Dialectical Analysis of the Fifth Chapter of the Treatise, by
Choney Lama Drakpa Shedrup (1675-1748), also an illustrious author of textbooks for
Sera Mey Tibetan Monastery (ACIP electronic text S0195, Part Five, ff. 11b-12a).

Here secondly is the position of our own school. The essential nature of a level
of deep practice can be defined as follows:
It is that state of knowledge which is of the type that provides a
foundation for the combination of quietude and vision, and
which can be classified as a viewpoint in the dichotomy between
actions and viewpoints.

DE LA GSUM DU DBYER YOD DE, GANG ZAG GI BDAG MED RTOGS PA'I RNAL 'BYOR GYI SA, CHOS KYI BDAG MED RAGS PA RTOGS PA'I RNAL 'BYOR GYI SA, STONG NYID RTOGS PA'I RNAL 'BYOR GYI SA DANG GSUM YOD PA'I PHYIR,
Levels of this kind can be divided into three: the level of deep practice wherein
you realize the selflessness of the person; the level of deep practice wherein
you realize the gross selflessness of objects; and the level of deep practice
wherein you realize emptiness itself.

************
We return next to Master Kedrup Tenpa Dargye's work, for more detail on the
function of the realizations of the three degrees of selflessness (Part Five, f. 8b):

'DIR LDOG PA'I SGO NAS BZHIR GSUNGS KYANG NGO BO'I SGO NAS RNAL 'BYOR SA LA GSUM DU GRANGS NGES PA YIN TE, RJOD BYED BKA'I DBANG DU BYAS NA'ANG GSUM DU GRANGS NGES, BSGOM BYA BAR CHAD MED LAM GYI DBANG DU BYAS NA YANG GSUM DU GRANGS NGES, RJES SU GZUNG BYA'I GDUL BYA'I DBANG DU BYAS NA YANG GSUM DU GRANGS NGES, LAG RJES KYI DBANG DU BYAS NA YANG GSUM DU GRANGS NGES PA'I PHYIR,
In terms of their identities, the various levels of deep practice are stated to be
four; but from the point of view of their actual nature, their number is exactly
three, for the following reasons. Relative to the teachings which express them,
the word of the Buddha, the number is precisely three. Relative to what you
meditate upon--that is, the uninterrupted path--the count is also three.
Relative to the disciple who is meant to be lead with them, the number is
three, and so it is with the mark they leave: exactly three.

DANG PO DE LTAR YIN TE, 'KHOR LO RIM PA GSUM PO DES RIM PA BZHIN DU BDAG MED PHRA RAGS GSUM GTAN LA 'BEBS, 'DIR DE GSUM SGOM PA'I RIM PA 'CHAD PA'I PHYIR,
The first of these reasons is correct because the three stages of the turning of
the wheel set forth, one by one, the three degrees of selflessness; and what is
being explained here are the stages by which one meditates upon these three.
 GNYIS PA DE LTAR YIN TE, 'DI'I RNAL 'BYOR GYI SA GSUM PO DE BDAG MED PHRA RAGS GSUM RTOGS PA'I LTA BA'I RIM PAR 'JOG PA'I PHYIR,
The second of the reasons is correct because the three levels of deep practice
here are set forth according to the order of the views of reality which perceive
the three degrees of selflessness.

GSUM PA DER THAL, RIGS CAN GSUM PO DES RNAL 'BYOR GYI SA GSUM PO DE RIM PA BZHIN DU BSGOM BYA'I GTZO BOR BYAS NAS SGOM PA'I PHYIR,
The third reason is correct because disciples of the three types do their
meditation by taking, as their principal object of meditation, these same three
levels of deep practice, respectively.

BZHI PA DE LTAR YIN TE, RNAL 'BYOR GYI SA GSUM BSGOMS PAS LAM SHES GSUM 'THOB PAR 'GYUR BA'I PHYIR, MDOR NA RNAL 'BYOR SA LA GSUM DU GRANGS NGES TE, 'BRAS BU BYANG CHUB CHEN PO THOB PA LA SA GSUM PO DE NGES PAR SGOM DGOS, SGRIB GNYIS SPONG BA'I LTA BA'I CHA LA DE LAS MANG MI DGOS, NYUNG NA MI 'DU BA'I PHYIR,
The fourth is correct because one attains the three knowledges of the path
through meditating upon these three levels of deep practice. In sum, the levels
of deep practice number exactly three, since you must definitely meditate upon
these three levels to attain the goal of the great enlightenment; no more than
these three are required as parts of the view which allows one to eliminate the
two obstacles, and these can not be abbreviated into fewer groups.
*************
The same work gives an insight into the relationship between the three types of
selflessness (Part One, f. 117a):

DE YANG MI 'THAD DE, 'DIR RTOGS PA YI NI CHOS DRUG DANG , ZHES SOGS KYI SKABS SU SGRUB PA BCU GSUM BDEN PAS STONG PA THEG CHEN SGRUB PA'I RTEN RANG BZHIN GNAS RIGS SU BSTAN PA LA, GNAS SKABS RIGS GSUM DANG RIGS CAN GSUM GYI DBYE BA MI 'THAD PA'I RTZOD LAN MDZAD PA GANG ZHIG, KHYOD KYI DE LA 'BREL MED PA'I PHYIR,
This too would be incorrect, because at the point where the text makes the
statement beginning with "Here the six objects of realization and. . ." it

is demonstrating that the fact that the thirteen practices are empty of
any true existence constitutes the resident nature which is the
foundation of the practice of the greater way; at this juncture (1) a
rebuttal is being directed to reject the idea that the division into the
three types and those who belong to these three types is incorrect. And
(2) your point has no connection here.

RTAGS PHYI MA DER THAL, BDAG MED PHRA RAGS GSUM 'GAL BA'I PHYIR,
The second part of our reason is correct, because the three degrees of
selflessness are all mutually exclusive.
************
We return to Choney Lama's treatise for the next selection, which comments on
whether the lower degrees of selflessness are true emptiness:

,KHA CIG, RGYUN MTHA'I BAR CHAD MED LAM GYIS GZUGS DANG GZUGS 'DZIN PA'I TSAD MA RDZAS GZHAN GYIS STONG PA'I STONG NYID MNGON SUM DU RTOGS PAR THAL, DES DE BYA RDZOGS KYI SKAD CIG MA GCIG LA MNGON SUM DU RTOGS PA'I PHYIR,
Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
It must too be the case that the uninterrupted path in the mind
of a person at the end of the process realizes, directly, the
form of emptiness which is the absence of a separate
substance to physical matter and the valid perception
which perceives this physical matter,
Because it perceives this fact directly in a single briefest instant of
action.

DER THAL, DES DE DE LTAR RTOGS NUS PA'I PHYIR, ZER NA, MA KHYAB,
[We disagree with your reason.]
But you can't, because it does have the capacity to do so.
Our answer would be that it doesn't necessarily follow.

'DOD MI NUS TE, THEG CHEN GYI BAR CHAD MED LAM YIN PA'I PHYIR,
And one could never agree with your position, because we are talking about
the uninterrupted path in the higher way.

KHYAB STE, GZUGS DANG GZUGS 'DZIN PA'I TSAD MA RDZAS GZHAN GYIS STONG PA'I STONG NYID DE KUN RDZOB BDEN PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[It doesn't necessarily follow.]
But it does necessarily follow, because that emptiness represented by the
absence of a separate substance to physical matter and the valid perception
which perceives this physical matter is deceptive reality.
************
We turn next to a discussion of the distinction between the three tracks mentioned
above and the three scopes as described in the teachings on the steps of the path to
enlightenment (the lam-rim). The following selection is taken from the Great Book
on the Steps of the Path (the Lam-rim chen-mo) of Je Tsongkapa (ACIP electronic
text S5392, f. 58b):

,DE LA NYAN THOS DANG RANG SANGS RGYAS KYI THEG PA LAS BRTZAMS TE JI SNYED CIG GSUNGS PA THAMS CAD NI SKYES BU 'BRING DNGOS SAM 'BRING DANG THUN MONG BA'I CHOS SGOR DU 'DU STE, SKYES BU 'BRING NI SRID PA MTHA' DAG LA SKYO BA BSKYED NAS SRID PA LAS GROL BA'I THAR PA RANG GI DON DU THOB BYAR BYAS TE DE'I THABS LAM BSLAB PA GSUM LA 'JUG PA YIN PA'I PHYIR TE,
All those teachings that were given from the point of view of the tracks of the
Listeners and the Self-Made Buddhas can be classified either as teachings that
belong to the medium scope itself, or as teachings which are shared with the
medium scope. This is because a person of the medium scope reaches a
feeling of disgust for every form of this suffering circle of life, and works
towards the goal of achieving--for his own sake--the goal of a freedom in
which he is freed from the circle.

And this is so because the Lamp for the Path says,
Consider a person who has turned away
From pleasures of the circle of life,
And who has at this very same time turned back
From actions which are negative.
A person who thus is aspiring to
A state of peace for themselves
Is the one that we refer to
As one of the "medium scope."
************
Here finally is a note on the concept of being "substantial," since it is important in
the Independent group's description of the gross form of a self-nature to persons. The
following selection is taken from Master Changkya Rolpay Dorje's classic
Presentation of the Schools of Philosophy (ACIP electronic text S0062, Part Three,
ff. 26a-26b).

Generally speaking, there are a great many occurrences of the terms
"substantial" and "constructed" in the great works of philosophy. In a general
sense, there is no problem in applying the word "substantial" to anything that
exists at all, and this is the sense in the phrase, "Once something exists, it can
only be substantial." The opposite of this would be something that was
constructed; something like the two kinds of a self-nature, which--even though
they are held to exist by the imagination--are not something which actually
exists.

DON BYED NUS PA'I RDZAS YOD NI DNGOS PO RNAMS TE, 'DI'I BZLOG PHYOGS KYI BTAGS YOD NI SPYI MTSAN RNAMS SO, ,
"Substantial" in the sense of being able to perform a function refers to
functional things; the opposite of this one would be "constructed" things in the
sense of general identities.

"Substantial" in the sense of being something stable, unchanging, refers to
things like unproduced, empty space; a cessation of undesirable objects due to
the separate analysis [of the four realized truths during the path of seeing]; and
a cessation of undesirable objects not due to such an analysis. The
"constructed" things that were the opposite of these would be changing things.

"Substantial" in the sense of being self-standing refers to things like the objects
that are held by sense consciousnesses, or self-supporting states of mind. The
opposite of this kind of substantial would be "constructed" things in the form
of changing things which are neither physical nor mental, as well as constructs
of the mind.

DE LTAR NA PHYI MA 'DI NI RDZAS BTAGS MTSAN NYID PA DANG SNGA MA'I RDZAS YOD RNAMS NI RNAM GRANGS KYI RDZAS YOD DO, ,
As such, only the last version of "substantial" is the actual one; the previous
types are all only "substantial" in name.

Here is the real meaning of this last sense of "substantial":
Anything which is (1) an existing object; and which (2) is self-
supporting, in the sense of being able to appear in the mind
independently, without relying on the process of appearing in the
mind only through the appearance in the mind of other objects
first.

BTAGS PAR YOD PA'I DON NI, CHOS GANG ZHIG RANG NYID BLO YUL DU 'CHAR BA RANG LAS GZHAN PA'I CHOS KYI RNAM PA BLO YUL DU 'CHAR BA LA NGES PAR LTOS DGOS PA'O, ,
And here is the real meaning of this last sense of "constructed":
Anything which is (1) an existing object; and which (2) is
something which must rely on the process of appearing in the
mind only through the appearance in the mind of other objects
first.
************
Further clarification of this point appears in the same text (Part Three, ff. 26b-27a):
 'DI'I RANG RKYA THUB PA'I RDZAS YOD DANG GANG ZAG GI BDAG MED KYI SKABS KYI RANG RKYA THUB PA'I RDZAS YOD GNYIS DON MI GCIG STE, 'DI LA NI RANG GI NGO BO BLO YUL DU 'CHAR BA CHOS GZHAN GZUNG BA LA LTOS MI DGOS PAR RANG DBANG DU 'CHAR BA TZAM LA BYED CING , CIG SHOS NI DBANG BSGYUR BYA'I PHUNG PO RNAMS LA MA LTOS PAR DE DAG LA DBANG SGYUR 
BYED RJE BO LTA BUR RANG RKYA BAR GRUB PA ZHIG DGOS PA'I PHYIR ZHES MKHAS PA DAG GSUNG NGO , ,
The meaning of "substantial in the sense of self-standing" here, and the
meaning "substantial in the sense of self-standing" when we speak of the lack
of a self-nature to the person, are not the same--great thinkers distinguish
between them as follows. The phrase here is used only to describe something
which can appear in the mind in an independent way, without relying on the
process of appearing in the mind only after some other objects have appeared
in it first. That other use of the phrase describes a controller of the heaps of
a particular person who is at the same time independent of the same heaps
being controlled: a kind of a director who is self-standing.

If you use the reasoning that helps you deny the possibility that a self-nature
of persons could exist, and thereby deny that the person could exist
substantially, then the person must beyond doubt become something which is
constructed. At this point then you must establish a way to verify that a
person is constructed. This is done first by establishing that there could be no
person of this type that could be a self-standing object; by implication then, one
comes to realize that the person is something only constructed, on the basis of
a composite or a stream of parts.

GANG ZAG BTAGS PAR YOD PA'I DON DU SONG BAS GANG ZAG BTAGS YOD YIN PA'I DON NI SKABS 'DI'I BTAGS YOD DANG DON GCIG TU YOD DO, ,
The way in which we say that a person like this is just a construct is that the
specific identity of the person cannot appear in the mind without relying on
a basis for the construct (the heaps)--along with words, concepts, and so on.
The meaning of what it is for the person to be constructed is that the specific
identity of the person can only appear in the mind through these other things
appearing first. Therefore what it means when we say that a person is
"something constructed" is the same as what we mean when we speak of
things that are constructed here at this point in the present text.

For this reason, the meaning of the word "substantial" as we use it with the
"substantial" person whose existence we are refuting should be understood as
referring to that "substantial" which is the opposite of this same
"constructed"--this is something proven through the reasoning which denies
other extremes. As such, the essential point is the same as with the
"substantial" you find here.

Course XV: What the Buddha Really Meant
Reading Ten: Interpretations of the Consequence Group, and
What Je Tsongkapa Himself Believes
The following selection gives a brief but exquisite description of how the concept of
emptiness is explained by followers of the Consequence group of the Middle-Way
School of Buddhism (the Madhyamika Prasangika). It is taken from the Overview of
the Middle Way (dBu-ma spyi-don) by Kedrup Tenpa Dargye (1493-1568), an
eminent author of textbooks for Sera Mey Tibetan Monastery (ACIP electronic text
number S0021, ff. 125a-130a).

Here we will analyze the statement [from Entering the Middle Way, by Master
Chandrakirti (650 AD)] where it says, "...The mind of a craving spirit as well,
which sees a stream of water as pus." One may begin with the following
question:
Let's consider the objects of the following states of mind: the
visual consciousness of a craving spirit where a river of water
looks like pus and blood; the visual consciousness of a person
with a kind of cataract where a clean white porcelain basin looks
like a hair has fallen into it; and that kind of meditation where

you visualize skeletons--where you imagine that the entire
surface of the earth is covered with the bones of corpses. Are all
these objects completely equivalent, as far as being something
that exists or doesn't exist?

In reply we will first set forth a relevant passage, and then we will explain the
passage. Here is the first. The text called The Abbreviation of the Greater Way
says,
Insofar as craving spirits, animals,
Humans, and pleasure beings, each according
To their class, have differing perceptions
Of a single thing, we say it has no reality.
Asvabhava, the holy layman with lifetime vows, has explained the passage.
His words include the following:
When they look at a single thing, a stream of water, each one sees
what the ripening of his particular karma forces him to see. A
craving spirit sees the river full of pus and blood and the like.

DE NYID LA DUD 'GRO LA SOGS PAS GNAS KYI BLOS GNAS PAR BYED PA DANG ,
An animal or such, on the other hand, thinks of this same water

and they swim in it.

empty space, for their ability to conceptualize physical matter has
dissolved altogether.

Someone may make the following claim:
Given the statements that have come above, the fact is that we should
never again consider anything as being one way or the other.
Well then, you must be suggesting that the system of the Buddha is all the
same as the system of every non-Buddhist belief, that there is no difference in
their correctness at all. And you must be saying too that we could never state
that our Teacher was the highest teacher, and that the teachers of the non-
Buddhists are lesser.

And you must be suggesting all this, for you have claimed that we should
never again consider anything as being one way or the other.
Now if you should agree that none of the differences mentioned above exist,
we must reply that they do, for as the verse says:
All other teachers now I've given up,
And go for refuge now to only You;
Why? Because it's You alone who has
No fault, and perfected every good.

Someone else might make the following claim:
Suppose a pleasure being, a human, and a craving spirit sit down
together and look at a glass filled with water: the thing that we
define as "wet and flowing." Since to the perceptions of each
different type of being it is real, the glass full of wet and flowing
water is in reality pus and blood to the eyes of the craving spirit,
and in reality water to the eyes of the human, and in reality
ambrosia to the eyes of the pleasure being.

We ask you then a question: in the situation you've just described, is it that the
visual consciousness of all three beings are a valid perception, or is it that only
one or two of them are a valid perception?
Suppose you say all three are valid. Well then, the glass of something wet and
flowing, of water, must be full of something that is all three different things:
pus and blood, and each of the others. And then too it must be possible for
there to be multiple and yet still valid perceptions which see one thing in two
completely incompatible ways. And finally there must be such a thing as a
valid perception which correctly perceives that the glass is filled with
something which is simultaneously water and yet not water.
Why so? Because, according to your view, the three differing cases of visual
consciousness possessed by the three different beings would all have to be
valid perception.

And if you try to agree to these absurdities, you are wrong, for the quality of
being pus and blood is incompatible with the quality of being either one of the
other two substances mentioned. Moreover, the quality of being water and the
quality of not being water are directly incompatible in such a way that, if
something exists and lacks one of these qualities, it must then possess the
other.

Someone may answer with the following claim:
In the case mentioned, the visual consciousness of the human is
a valid perception, but the visual consciousnesses of the other
two types of beings are not valid perception. These latter two
see something like the pus and blood, and the ambrosia, only
because their karma (which is good in one case, and bad in the
other) forces them to.

Well then, according to you, the visual consciousness of the human wouldn't
be valid perception either. Because isn't it true that the human sees the water
only because his karma (which in this case is halfway between the good and
the bad just mentioned) forces him to?
Moreover, aren't you implying then that there is no such thing as a valid tactile
consciousness, or a valid auditory consciousness, in the mental stream of any
being who is not a human? Because aren't you saying that there's no such
thing as a valid visual consciousness in the mental stream of any such being?
Certainly you are, for you believe your original position to be correct. And
suppose now that you do agree that such beings can have no such valid
consciousnesses.

Aren't you then implying that these beings never have any case where they are
able to reach a definite conclusion about something, or to analyze an object?
And if so, aren't you implying that there could never be a case where one of
these beings could recognize another? Of course you are, given your position.

Here secondly is the section where we establish our own position. Now
suppose three different types of beings--a pleasure being, a human, and a
craving spirit, each with their own karma--sit down together and look upon
a glass filled with water, the thing we define as "wet and flowing." The glass
of water is not at this point one thing which is simultaneously three different
objects. Neither is it necessary in this situation for there to be three identical
valid perceptions. And when the glass full of wet and flowing water occurs,
it occurs with three different, distinct parts to it.
[Translator's note: When the phrase "wet and flowing" (the definition of the element
of water) is used here, it should be understood as emphasizing the more general
concept of a liquid, rather than the water which the human perceives.]

It is not though the case that, from the time it first started, the glass of water
came with the three different parts, or that they stay with the glass of water

until it eventually ends. What happens is that one of the parts of the glass
filled with wet and flowing water provides a material cause, and the karma of
the craving spirit provides a contributing factor; and then based on both of
these the later continuation of one part of the glass of water starts being blood
and pus.

Yet another part of the glass of water provides a material cause, and the karma
of the pleasure being provides a contributing factor; and then based on both
of these the later continuation of one part of the glass of water starts being
ambrosia, and so on.

At this point, the glass full of wet and flowing water is something with three
different parts. Nonetheless, it is not the case that all three different beings see
all three parts. The craving spirit is forced by the bad karma he has collected
to see the glass of water as pus and blood; and he doesn't see the other two
things. One should understand that a similar case holds with the latter two
types of beings.

What we just described as happening is only with reference to where a glass
of something wet and flowing is an object shared by the three different beings,
as they look at it together. When the craving spirit himself though picks up
the glass in his hand and begins to partake of its contents, the glass of liquid
is no longer something that exists with three different parts. Since at this point
it is something that the craving spirit is experiencing exclusively, its
continuation starts being pus and blood.

How the glass of liquid exists originally all depends on the particular outer
world from where it has been taken, for each of the three different beings has
a different outer world, depending on the specific karma he himself has
collected. If the glass of liquid were sweet, cool water taken from the world
of humans--a world created by the specific karma of the human in the
group--then that would be its original condition, and so on.

PHYIR,
When we say that a craving spirit looks at a stream of water and sees pus and
blood, by the way, we are only talking about some kinds of craving spirits, and
not all of them. This is because there are many kinds of craving spirits: some
with obstacles in the world around them that prevent them from relieving their
craving; some with obstacles that are parts of their bodies; and some with
obstacles that relate to the food or drink itself.

There is, moreover, an example we can use for how, when the three different
types of beings with their three karmas look all together at a glass full of
something wet and flowing, there start to be three different objects, each
confirmed by a valid perception. Suppose there is a ball of red-hot steel; one
piece of this ball provides the material cause, and the "mantra of steel"
provides a contributing factor. Due to these two, a person who has used the
mantra of steel on his hand can touch the ball, but he doesn't undergo any
sensation of heat; instead, he feels some other sensation. A person who has
not used the mantra on his hand touches the ball and does feel a sensation of
heat, and no other kind of sensation.

Another example would be the moon in springtime; one part of the feel of its
rays on the body provides the material cause, and then the karma of a craving
spirit provides a contributing factor. Based on these two, the spirit gets a
sensation of heat, which is experienced by the consciousness of the body.
So too with the wintertime sun; one part of the feel of its rays on the body
provides the material cause, and then the karma of the craving spirit provides
a contributing factor. Based on these two, the spirit gets a sensation cold,
which is experienced by the consciousness of the body.

It is a fact that they get this kind of sensation, for [Arya Nagarjuna's] Letter to
a Friend states:
For craving spirits, even the light of the moon
In the spring is hot, and even the winter sun cold.

All of this is caused by the extraordinary circumstances of the particular time
and place, for generally speaking it never happens this way: there is nothing
at all about the sun that can feel cold, and nothing about the moon that can
feel hot. This too is a fact, for there does not exist on the sun any case of that
substance we call "covered space."

Here is the third part of our presentation, where we refute the rebuttal of
representatives of other views. You will recall that our own position is
describing a situation where beings of three different types, each with their
own karma, are sitting together and looking at a glass filled with something
that is wet and flowing. The glass filled with something wet and flowing exists,
at this point, as something with three distinct parts. Nonetheless, no one of the
beings is able to see all three things there, for they are each at the mercy of the
particular karma that they themselves have collected. Representatives of other
viewpoints now come to attack this position.

One comes and makes the following claim:
Your position, as just explained, is mistaken, for it goes against
a statement of the glorious Dharmakirti. This is quite surely the
case, for in his major work [entitled The Commentary on Valid
Perception] he says,

Suppose you say that they don't see it,
And circumstances cause another form.
What he's talking about here is a belief of the [non-Buddhist]
Numerist School. They give the case of a single person whose
physical form is looked upon at the same time by his enemy, and
also by his friend. In reality, the person's physical form is both
attractive and ugly at the same time. Something happens where
yet another physical form, one from karma, grows up between
the person's true physical form and the enemy and friend looking
at it. Because of this neither the enemy nor the friend sees both
the attractiveness and the ugliness together.
Master Dharmakirti uses logic to refute this concept, and this
same logic can be used against the position you have taken, to
prove that you are wrong.

Your reasoning here is though incorrect, for the belief you have expressed
shows that you have failed to understand both the meaning of Master
Dharmakirti's statement, and the whole position expressed above.

DES DE SGRIB PA'I PHYIR,
This is a fact, for the actual meaning of Master Dharmakirti's statement is as
follows. The Numerist School is describing a situation where you are looking
at a physical form either from far away, or from up close. They say that,
depending on the distance between you and the object, another physical form
which is the result of karma, and which stands between your visual
consciousness and the original form, is either clear or not. This then determines
whether the original form appears to you distinctly or not. It is not the case
though, they say, that what determines whether the original form appears
clearly or not is whether or not you have a clear impression of this form.
In reply then Master Dharmakirti is asking the Numerists:
Let's consider these two cases of some intermediate physical form
that comes from karma. Do they, or do they not, function to
obscure the two original forms, the one at a distance, and the
other close by? If they were to obscure them, then your visual
consciousness could never see the two original forms, since they
would have been obscured by the others.

And suppose you say that they do not obscure them. Wouldn't
your visual consciousness then see both the two intermediate
forms created by karma, and the two original forms, the near one
and the far one, all at the same time? They would have to
because, according to you, the intermediate forms do not obscure
the original ones.
This is the real point of the Master's statement, wherein he refutes that belief
of the Numerists.

Our second point [that you have failed to comprehend the position we
expressed above] is also quite true. Our original position was describing a
situation where three different kinds of beings were sitting together and
looking at a glass full of something wet and flowing. It is not our position that
the glass full of something wet and flowing is one thing that is three different
things. And it is not our position that there is such a thing as the physical
appearance of a person which is at once both attractive and ugly.
It is furthermore not our position that the blood and pus represent some kind
of physical form which results from karma and grows up between the visual
consciousness of the craving spirit and the stream of water. And it is not our
position that the craving spirit's eyes see both this blood and pus as some kind
of physical form resulting from karma, and the river of water at the same time.
It is our position that, by force of his karma, the craving spirit is not able to see
the stream of water.

And anyway, maybe it's you who have contradicted a statement of the glorious
Dharmakirti. You have taken the position that the five sicknesses, and the five
elements, and the five demons are all the direct result of the five poisons--the
five bad thoughts. But when the non-Buddhists take the position that phlegm
and desire have a cause-and-effect relationship, and that bile and anger have
the same kind of relationship, and so on, then Master Dharmakirti refutes them
by showing that desire doesn't always come and go according to the phlegm,
and anger doesn't always come and go according to the bile. To do so he
makes the statement that says, "It's not a fact that wind and the rest are such,
for the relationship doesn't always hold." We could twist around this statement
too and say that it disproved your position; and add as well how wrong it is
to assert that uncreated space could ever be the direct result of jealousy.
[Translator's note: The point seems to be that, although your position about the bad
thoughts, and our original position on the nature of the three beings' perceptions, are
both correct, you could always twist around some quotation by a master, take it out
of context or misinterpret it, and try to show they were wrong.]

Someone else might come and make yet another claim:
Let's talk about that quotation above, where it said:

Insofar as [these different beings] have
differing perceptions
Of a single thing, we say it has no reality.
The idea being expressed here is that a single object can be
appearing in three different ways. This is incorrect because,
according to you, what's happening is that three different objects
are appearing in three different ways. And this certainly is your
position; remember, you were describing a situation where three
different kinds of beings sit down together and look at a glass
full of something that's wet and flowing. You said that there
were three different objects, each confirmed by a valid
perception, and that they were appearing in three different ways.

In response to this line of reasoning, someone responds:
No, there's no such problem here. The five protuberances are all
parts of the one person, so we have to say that--when the five

actions.

Well the case above is exactly the same! The three things mentioned, the blood
and pus and the other two, are all parts of the glass full of something wet and
flowing. When the three appear then we can say that the glass full of a thing
which is wet and flowing is acting as a basis, and that three different ways of
appearing are being displayed upon it.

Someone else may come now and make yet another argument:
Let's talk about these three things: the pus and blood, and the
other two. Are you implying then that these are not types of
objects which would block each other from entering the space
that each one occupies? After all, you were talking about a
situation where those three types of beings, each with their own
karma, sit down together and look at a glass full of water. And
you said that your position was that it was possible for there to
be three different objects there, each one confirmed by a valid
perception.

This kind of reasoning, where you attempt to show that we are implying that
the three objects are not the kinds that block each other from entering the space

that each one occupies, cannot disprove our position. It is not our belief that
in this situation the glass full of something which is wet and flowing is one
thing which is three different things. Neither did we ever say that there
definitely had to be identical valid perceptions here.

Someone might make the following claim:
In his Commentary to the Twenty Verses, Master Vinitadeva makes
this statement--
If there was not a single drop of pus there, then
how could there ever be a whole river of pus?
They are forced to see it, through the ripening of
their karma.
According to you, this statement would have to be mistaken,
because when the three different kinds of beings sit down
together and look at the glass full of something wet and flowing,
the visual consciousness of the craving spirit is a valid
perception, and the pus is real pus.

And yet there is no such problem. No matter how many arguments of this
kind you want to present, they are all made from the point of view of denying
the existence of external objects. The way these arguments go is as follows.
If the color blue were to exist as an external object, then the following would
occur when this color appeared directly to a sense perception grasping blue;
that is, with such a perception found in the mental stream of one of those who
"only sees this side" [which is another name for those who have not yet
perceived emptiness directly].
When an earlier instance of the perception of blue ends, what actually happens
is that it plants a mental seed which eventually grows into a later instance of
the same perception of blue, when the seed ripens. Suppose the blue were not
just this kind of appearance, but rather an appearance where blue as an outer
object were transmitting a likeness of itself and thereby appearing to one's
perceptions. Something else then would be happening when the three different
beings sit down together and look at the glass full of something wet and
flowing. The three different objects would be appearing to them because each
of the objects was transmitting a likeness of itself to their perception. All of
this would be happening independent of any process where each being's karma
planted a mental seed, which later ripened and produced the appearance of the
object.

ZHES BKAG PA'I PHYIR,
If this were how the three objects were appearing, then they would not be
appearing through a process where the specific and different karma that each
of the three beings had collected had planted a seed in their mind which later
ripened. As such each of the beings involved would have to be perceiving all
three of the objects, whereas the fact is that they do not.
All this is an argument attempting to refute those who refuse to accept the
denial of outer objects.

The real meaning of the quotation by Master Vinitadeva is therefore the
following:
Suppose there didn't exist a single drop of pus that existed as it
appeared to exist to the craving spirit; that is, which existed as an
outer object. How then could there exist a whole river full of pus
which existed as an outer object? These beings do though see the
pus and so on, for they are forced to do so by their karma.

And this is certainly the case, for later on in the text someone argues that--if
the pus and blood did not exist as outer objects, and if they were only a part
of the mind itself-- then they could never provide the function of being
something to eat or drink. And in response, Master Vinitadeva says "Actions
and their objects are like an injury in a dream." He is saying that, even though

the pus and blood do not exist as outer objects, nonetheless they can perform
the function of being something to eat or drink. He proves his point by using
a great many examples, such as a dream.

If this were not the case, then one would have to say that form and other such
doorways through which perceptions grow did not even exist at all. Why?
Because you would be saying that all the sutras which state that they do exist
are sutras which do not mean what they say; sutras which you have to
interpret to understand their true meaning. And this too is certainly the case,
for the autocommentary to the Twenty Verses states that:
In the same way, statements by the victorious Buddha where He
says that form and other such doors of perception do exist would
be examples of His word that must be interpreted to establish
their real meaning; statements that are only spoken figuratively,
for the benefit of disciples who might require such explanations.

In response to this someone might claim:
There's no problem; the point of this statement is to say that
sutras which explain form and similar doors of perception as
actually existing as outer objects are only spoken figuratively, and
must be interpreted to establish their true meaning.

Well then, the meaning of the original statement then is just the same: it is
saying that "there does not exist even a drop of pus and blood which exists as
an outer object."

Yet again, another argument might be made:
Let's take the case of one of those craving spirits that looks at a
river of water, and sees it as a dry riverbed, genuinely so. Or
consider one that looks at a tree loaded with fruit, but sees it as
nothing but bare limbs, genuinely so. The visual consciousness
of both of these beings then must be a valid perception. Why?
Remember the case of the three different beings looking at a glass
full of something wet and flowing; according to you, the pus and
blood was actual pus and blood, and the perception of them by
the craving spirit was genuine: his visual consciousness was a
valid perception.

Just because we said that about the other case doesn't mean that it's true in
every case. If the craving spirit hadn't seen any water in that area in the first
place, it wouldn't have made any sense for him to go over in that direction to
try to enjoy some of the water. Therefore what happened was that, at first, he
saw some water. Later on, he was forced by his karma to stop seeing water
and saw only bare, parched earth. Then he had an impression where he
thought the water had dried up.
The case with the fruit tree is the same. Although at first the craving spirit
sees a tree loaded with fruit, later on his karma forces him to stop seeing fruit,
and all he sees is bare branches. Then he has an impression where he thinks
that the tree has no fruit any more.

When all this is happening, the obstacle in the visual consciousness of the
craving spirit prevents him from seeing the river of water, and so he sees a
dry, parched riverbed. The same is true for the visual consciousness of a
human: if the obstacle were there, it would prevent him from seeing the river
of water, and then he would have to see a dry, parched riverbed.

From one point of view, the river of water hasn't dried up when the craving
spirit looks at it; but there is a river which has dried up, if you're talking about
a river of water that the spirit can see, or a river of water that the spirit can drink
from. This follows because when the three different types of beings sit down
together and look at a glass full of something wet and flowing, it is true that,
due to the force of karma, three different kinds of objects exist there at the
same time: the pus and blood, and the other two.

Given all this, consider craving spirits that have obstacles that relate to their
food and drink itself. The food and drink there really is food and drink, until
such time as the spirit starts trying to eat or drink it. When he does try to do
so, then the continuum of the food into the next moment starts becoming pus
and blood. It is not though that it is the simple appearance of something as
pus and blood that could ever function as something to eat or drink. If this
were the case, then the rules of karma and its consequences would have to be
less than what they really are. And this is true, for if a craving spirit like this
ever existed it would represent a failure of the laws of karma and its
consequences.

Suppose moreover that there were no pus and blood out there to appear as the
pus and blood, and suppose that the mere appearance of something looking
like pus and blood could ever function as something to eat or drink. Well then,
you would also have to be able to use a comb on the hair that appears to exist
on a porcelain sink to a person with cataracts. And a horsefly that appeared
to the same person would have to be able to give him a bite. And the water
of a mirage would have to provide all the normal functions of water, and so

on. Why so? Well because, according to you, there is no pus and blood out
there to appear as pus and blood; according to you, the mere appearance of
something looking like pus and blood can provide all the functions of things
that you eat and drink.

And consider again this case where a pleasure being and a human and a
craving spirit and an animal or the like all sit down together and look at a
glass full of something wet and flowing. According to you, it would have to
be genuine when something that just looked like ambrosia appeared to the
pleasure being, and it would have to be genuine when something that just
looked like pus and blood appeared to the craving spirit, but there couldn't be
any pus and blood out there to appear as pus and blood. And if this were the
case, then consider the visual consciousness of a being in the hells. It would
then have to be a valid perception towards something appearing to it that just
looked like the burning steel of the hells, and towards something that just
looked like the forest of swords, and towards something that just looked like
a mass of fire, and so on. Finally, this person would not have any valid
perceptions at all towards any of these things as actual objects. Why would
this all have to be so? If your idea were correct, it would have to be, for the
logic here is identical to your own.

And suppose you agree that this hell being could have no valid perceptions of
the type we mentioned. Well then, the burning steel and other objects could
never perform any real actions: they could never burn the bodies of the people
born there, they could never chop them up, and so on. Why? Well because
of what you just agreed to. And suppose you agree to this; that they could
never perform any real actions. Well then, the torment of the hells itself then
must not even exist, by your own admission. And remember too that case
where the beings all sit down and look at the same thing. You must be saying
then that the actual water, the thing towards which the visual consciousness
of the human is a valid perception, doesn't exist at all. Why? Well because,
according to you, no actual pus and blood exists either in the same situation.

Someone might now make the following claim:
In this situation, there does exist some real water there. This is
because the human can confirm the water with his own
experience, as it performs all the functions of water--as he uses
it to wash himself, or as he uses it to cook something.
Well then, in the same situation there must exist some real pus and blood there
as well, because in this same situation the craving spirit can confirm the pus
and blood with his own experience as they perform their functions--as he
drinks them, and then as the sizzle in his throat and stomach, and so on.

into a porcelain basin, there is no strand of hair in the basin at
all? And, secondly, doesn't [Master Dharmakirti's] text itself say,

And yet there is no such problem, for this quotation appears in the section
where we are examining the question of whether, in the schools of the Middle

in either both existing or both not existing. Moreover, there is another fact
about this situation, where the stream of water appears as pus and blood to the
visual consciousness of the craving spirit. It is no inconsistency to say that the
visual consciousness that sees things this way is not a valid perception, and to
say at the same time that--when the craving spirit looks at the stream of
water--there does exist there actual pus and blood.

Someone again may come and claim the following:
Let's consider once more this situation where three different
types of beings sit down together and look at a glass full of
something wet and flowing. Isn't it true that there is no actual
pus and blood there? Because isn't it true that the burning steel
and so on in the hells is only something that appears to a person
who is born there, but that there is nothing there which actually
is these objects? Because isn't it true that there is no one at all
who went and made all these kinds of things? And isn't this a
fact, because doesn't the text of The Bodhisattva's Way of Life say:
Who made the burning steel that acts
As the floor of the world of hell?
Where did all the mass of flames
You find there all come from?
The Able Ones have spoken that
Everything there like this

burning steel and so on are not something that was created by some
unchanging creator being or something like that; by someone who thought it
over first and then created them. The lines are meant to show us that what
really made all these things is the non-virtuous states of mind had by the
beings who have to take birth there.

Suppose this were not the case; consider then those holy people who lead their

and then experience the pleasures of these realms. And consider too those
miserable people who lead their lives following the ten non-virtues, and who
are then born into the lower realms, and then experience the sufferings of these

Are you saying then that the pleasures of the higher realms don't even exist,
and that the pains of the lower realms don't even exist? You must be, if you
agree this way.

In conclusion now, let us consider again these three kinds of beings, each with
their different karma, as they sit down together and look at a glass full of
something wet and flowing. It's not necessarily true that they must all have
valid perceptions which are identical. If they did, then the three beings looking
at the glass of water would have to think of the water as a place to live, in the
way that a creature living in water would. The three beings as well would
have to see the water in the same way that microscopic organisms living in the
water, little beings imperceptible to normal visual consciousness, see it with
their own visual consciousness. Then too the visual consciousness of
microscopic organisms living in the depths of the ocean would have to be a
valid perception towards the entire extent of the sea. And certain kinds of
near-gods too would have to see weapons as glasses of water, and on and on;
the problems raised would be many.

Again consider this same situation. Even though it is not necessarily true that
the valid perceptions are identical, it is possible for there to be three valid
perceptions here which happen to be identical. This is because, as we have
already established logically, there can be a case where by the force of karma
three different objects, each one confirmed by a valid perception, start to exist.
And since this is possible, then it is equally possible that, by the force of
karma, three equivalent valid perceptions of a vessel could start to exist as
well.

Generally speaking, each of the three objects mentioned--the pus and the other
two--are things of the type that block other objects from entering into the
space which they themselves occupy. It is no contradiction though to say that,
in this situation where the beings are looking this way, they are not objects
such that they block other things from entering into the space they occupy.
This is true for the following reason.
A central mountain of the world which is square in shape, and a central
mountain of the world which is round in shape, and the like, are objects such
that they block other things from entering the space they occupy.
Nevertheless, it is possible for both these things to occupy the space taken up
by a single central mountain of the world. A red-hot ball of steel is something
that's hot, but consider what happens when a person touches it after he has
used the mantra of steel on his hand. The sensation that he feels is not a
sensation of heat; on the contrary, it is a sensation of something not heat.
[This concludes the section of the text entitled "The Stream."]

When the text of the Essence of Eloquence was taught by Geshe Tupten Rinchen,
he took great pains to point out that it is not correct--as some Western scholars have
stated--that Je Tsongkapa himself adhered to the tenets of the Mind-Only School. The
following selection to show that he follows, of course, the beliefs of the Consequence
group is taken the concluding pages of our root text [ACIP electronic text S5396, ff.

Now suppose you come and ask the following:
We have a question for you. You have shown us how the
systems of the two great innovators make the distinction between
those parts of the highest of all spoken words which are
figurative, and those which are literal. And there are a great
variety of ways in which the different kings of all great thinkers
have commented upon the true intent of these two. Tell us
now--which of these master commentators do you follow; how
is it that you yourself decide on what is literal, and what is it that
you believe is the ultimate?

We answer with the following lines:
I can't deny that I feel respect from the bottom of my
heart
For all the fine words ever taught by the jewels among this
world's sages;
The reasoning though of dependence, invariable, for the
cycle and what's beyond
Acts to destroy our tendency to see things to be by the
features they have.

And when this pure white light of the Moon,* this
excellent explanation,
Has opened wide the night-blooming lotus, the eyes of the
intellect,
And we finally see that path set before us by
Buddhapalita,
Who then would fail to hold as their core Nagarjuna's
excellent way?
[*Translator's note: The "Moon" here (chandra in Sanskrit) is an allusion to Master
Chandrakirti.]

And so--in the context of the way of the perfections--it is the systems of the
two great innovators that have spread widely; systems by which, in the ways
we have described above, the meaning of that highest of spoken words is
divided into the literal and the figurative, to determine what thusness really
is. But it is also the case that those wise men who have commented upon the
great works of the way of the secret word, and the eminent practitioners of this
way, have set forth the meaning of thusness in keeping with one or the other
of these very two systems; there is no third system between the two. You
should understand then that this method is the path for determining the
meaning of thusness for each and every one of the works of the highest of
speech, whether we are talking of the open or the secret teachings.

And so imagine a person who tried to find the meaning of thusness without
relying on a system taught by one of the great innovators of the two methods.
They would be like a blind person without a guide for the blind, racing
towards some very dangerous place.

And suppose that a person did want to rely on one of these systems, but had
not spent a good deal of time acquanting themselves with their great books.
Suppose, in particular, that they were relying only on a few short descriptions
to determine the difference between those teachings of the Buddha which were
figurative, and those which were literal--without having a proper
understanding of the subtle, crucial points of reasoning involved. People like
this would be taking refuge in words only; and even if they were to attempt
to talk about thusness, it would be only words, without any essence.

Try to see how this is true, and never be satisfied with seeing even some great
number of the more obvious crucial points on these questions. Make the effort
to acquaint yourself well with both the gross and more subtle keys of
reasoning that the two great innovators have given us as eyes to see into the
Buddha's teaching. And then let your labors continue to flow, like some great
stream, coming to an understanding of the profound points of the far-reaching
traditions, and the profound traditions, and the more-profound-than-profound
traditions, in the teachings of the Buddha.

Take then lastly whatever you have understood and make it the very heart of
your own personal spiritual practice: it is for the likes of you, for those of
intelligence who hope to see the teachings of the Victorious Ones remain long
in our world, that I have set down into words this Essence of Eloquence.
