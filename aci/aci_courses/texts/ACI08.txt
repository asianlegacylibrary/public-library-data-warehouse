The third chapter [of the Treasure House of Higher Knowledge] is called "A
Presentation of the World," and our discussion of it has two parts: (1) an
explanation of the world of living beings--those who are taking birth, and (2)
an explanation of the world that acts as their container--the place in which
they're born. The living beings we will treat in three steps: their different
divisions, various features, and an in-depth explanation of their basic nature.
The first step itself covers first the division of beings into those of the three
realms, and then their division into the five types of birth.

These are the realm of desire. They are twenty

One may begin with the following question:
Above, [in line 292 of the second chapter,] you mentioned "states
of mental affliction with three realms." With these and other
references you have been indicating that the mind and mental
functions, as well as other objects, may be divided into categories
that relate to three different realms. Just what are these three
realms?
These three are the desire realm, the form realm, and the formless realm. We'll
start by describing the first of them.

YIN NO,
Hell beings [Sanskrit: naraka] are so called because they live without [Skt: na]
any comfort [Skt: rañj]. Craving spirits [preta] are so called either because they
come to their state without turning back [apunara¯vr¸t] or because they are
overcome [pari¯ta] by thirst. Animals [tiryañca] are given this name because
they go along on all fours, in a bent-over position [tiryac]. Men get their name
from their mental prowess [the Sanskrit etymology also holds in English], and
the six different types of pleasure beings or gods [divaukas] of the desire
realm are so called because their homes are in the sky [div]. These are the
realm of desire.

The realm of desire may also be divided into twenty different classes of beings.
By dividing hell into the eight hot hells, we get a total of ten different births
of misery. By dividing human beings up into those belonging to each of the
four continents, we get a total of ten happy kinds of birth. There is a reason
why we make no separate count of the eight cold hells and various partial
hells: the former are not the principal hells, and the latter are indefinite as to
lifespans, locations, and so on.

The Actual Level explains the desire realm as being divided into thirty-six parts.
In this count animals are excluded, since their location is nothing definite. The
others are the eight hot hells, eight cold hells, craving spirits, and lesser

pleasure beings, making a total of eighteen--and on top of this humans split
into those on each of twelve continents, and six types of desire-realm pleasure
beings.

Consider now these hell beings and the others, along with their particular
locations and the rest. They are the desire realm, for they are a realm of
objects with which mental afflictions which are non-virtues can develop.
Someone may then pose the following question:
What about the state of mind used to produce an emanation?
Isn't this something possessed by beings who are free of desire?
How could mental afflictions develop with this?

Someone else could hear that the person had such an ability, and gain desire
towards this state of mind. Or the person himself could begin to worry that
he might lose the ability and thus gain desire towards it. Still again, someone
might catch sight of some exquisite emanation, think how wonderful the state
of mind behind it was, and thereby start to desire it. Finally, even if this state
of mind doesn't directly cause mental affliction to develop in someone's mind,
it is still "an object with which mental affliction can develop"--since smells and
tastes of the desire realm can be emanated in this state.

Someone may ask why we call it the "desire realm." We do so because it is a
realm full of desire. And what is desire? Craving aimed at getting sex or
food.

Consider now the seventeen different locations above it--above the desire
realm. This is the realm of form, for it is first of all beyond the level of the
desire realm and can lead to the development of the particular mental
afflictions of this level. Secondly, it is a realm where form reaches its height.

This realm of form has seventeen parts in that there are three levels each
corresponding to each of the first three of the various types of concentration
that act as causes for a birth in "it"--that is, the form realm. And there are
eight different levels that correspond to the fourth and final type of
concentration. These correspondences are as follows.

RGYU SNYOMS 'JUG GI BSAM GTAN DANG PO CHUNG 'BRING CHEN PO GSUM BSGOMS PA LAS, TSANGS RIS, TSANGS PA MDUN NA 'DON, TSANGS CHEN GSUM DU RIM BZHIN DU SKYE,
One may engage in three different degrees of causal meditation relating to the
first concentration level: these are the greater, the medium, and the lesser.
These three degrees of meditation cause one to take birth, respectively, into the
levels known as "Class of the Pure," "Reciting Before the Pure One," and "the
Great Pure One."

Meditation on the same three degrees, relating to the second concentration
level, leads to respective births in the levels known as "Lesser Light,"
"Immeasurable Light," and "Clear Light." Meditation again on the three
degrees, those related to the third concentration level, leads to respective births
in the levels known as "Lesser Virtue," "Immeasurable Virtue," and
"Widespread Virtue."

Meditation on the stained parts of the fourth concentration level by ordinary
beings leads them to a birth at one of the three stages. They are known as
"Cloudless," "Birth of Merit," and the "Great Result." When realized beings
meditate on five different stages of the fourth concentration level, they take
their respective births in what are called the "Five Pure Places." The five causal
stages are known as "the lesser" (three alternations), "the medium" (six
alternations), "the great" (nine alternations), "the very great," (twelve
alternations), and "the really very great" (fifteen alternations).

One may ask why we call it the "form realm." It is so named because the
characteristic which distinguishes it is the extraordinary form there. The
Detailist group called "Under the Sun" claims that there are seventeen distinct
locales within the form realm because the god known as the "Great Pure One"
has a lifespan, feelings, and conceptions which are totally separate from those
of the beings who sit before him reciting their religious books.

The Kashmiri Detailists claim, on the other hand, that there are only sixteen
distinct locales in the form realm, since although the Great Pure One is
enthroned in a slightly elevated position at the head of those who recite before
him, there is really no separate location. Further, the Arya Master [Asanga]
has stated that there are eighteen distinct locales to the form realm, as it
includes the level known as "Below None" which is also a paradise.

There is no place for the formless realm;
Four kinds, depending on that given rise.
In this one the mental continuum
Is based on the discrete type and life as well.
[III.9-12]

There is no other, separate place for the formless realm. A person who is
born there must first have attained single-pointed concentration relating to the
formless realm, and must not have lost this ability since that time. When such
a person dies and migrates, he is born into the formless realm at the very place
where he died, the four "name" heaps of the formless realm coming into
existence there. There are however four kinds of levels to the formless realm,
depending on the relative quality of that meditation to which one had given
rise and which had caused his birth there. These are the levels known as the
"Door of Limitless Space" and so on.

"If there's no form in the formless realm," one may ask, "then what provides
a basis for the stream of mind there?" In this one--in the formless realm--the
continuum of the mind is based on the continuation of a discrete type of
being and upon life, as well. The words "as well" are meant to indicate that
this stream of mind is also based on the ordinary being, on the factors not
linked with mind, on holds, on the characteristics of birth, and so on.

"Well then," one might ask, "couldn't the stream of mind in one of the two
lower realms then also rely on the discrete type of being involved, or upon life,
without depending upon form?" It could not, because the mind in these cases
is of little force, as it is not yet free of the conception of form. The mind of the
formless realm, on the other hand, need not rely on form: because of the power
of its single-pointed concentration, the mind is free of the conception of form
and thus possesses considerable force.

Consider these different levels--the "Door of Limitless Space" and the others.
They are the formless realm, for they are first of all beyond the lower two
realms. Secondly, they consist of objects that can lead to the development of
the particular mental afflictions of the formless realm. And why is this realm
called the "formless realm"? It is given the name because it is a realm which
is absolutely devoid of form.

Having thus presented the division of living beings into those of the three

Now there are five types of birth, those of a hell being and the rest, in
them--in the three realms. They are indicated by their own separate names:
hell beings, craving spirits, animals, humans, and pleasure beings. [Refer to
the Sanskrit etymologies for these types listed in the commentary to the first
verse of this chapter.]

What, in their essence, are they? Not virtue, because there are individuals
among them who have lost their core of virtues; and not mental affliction,
since there are those among them who have eliminated all their mental
afflictions. Thus we can say that they are, rather, ethically neutral things, of
the type that is not an impediment.

,RGYUD KYIS BSDUS PAS SEMS CAN ZHES BYA BA YIN LA, BAR SRID NI SEMS CAN YIN GYI, 'GRO BA MA YIN TE, BSTAN BCOS GDAGS PA LAS,
The five types are part of living beings, so they are known as "sentient
beings." Those beings in between death and rebirth are sentient beings but
not considered here as a separate type of birth. As Comment on Wisdom says,

The four ways of birth cover all five types
Of birth, though the five don't cover all four.

The sutra called The Seven Types of Lives states as well:

There are seven types of lives: life as a hell being, life as a
craving spirit, life as an animal, life as a human, life as a pleasure
being, life as a category of deeds, and the life in between.

...They are to be included among the full-fledged pleasure beings.
This is because they vie with these beings in their physical
appearance and material wealth, and belong to the same family.
The lesser pleasure beings are though inferior in their qualities to
the complete pleasure beings, and thus we refer to them as
"pleasure beings" but [in Sanskrit and Tibetan] with the negative
attached to their name, to indicate inferiority.

The sutra called Constant Recollection explains that the lesser pleasure beings
should be grouped with craving spirits or among the animals. A number of
other sutras also teach them as being a sixth type of being.

As for harmful spirits, some may be counted among the pleasure beings, and
others among the craving spirits. The spirits known as "those who live on
smells" are grouped into the pleasure beings, as they serve as their musicians.
The great garuda birds, the "big-belly" and "humanoid" spirits, as well as the
serpent-like naga creatures are all explained as belonging to the animal type.

The spirits known as "flesh-eaters," "crazy-makers," and "those who cause

of craving spirits.

This completes our discussion of the different divisions of living beings. Now
we continue to a presentation of their various features. This presentation will
cover four topics: the seven states of consciousness, the nine states of living
beings, the four states of consciousness, and an analysis of how the seven and
four states overlap.

Here the states of birth for living beings
Are counted as four: birth from an egg and the rest.
Four exist with humans, and animals.
Hell beings and the beings of pleasure as well
As beings between their lives are born complete.
Craving spirits are also born from the womb.
[III.31-6]

One may begin with the question: "How many states of birth are there for
beings of the three realms?" Here in the three realms the different states of
birth for living beings are counted as four: birth from an egg and "the
rest"--which refers to birth from the womb, birth from warmth and moisture,
and instantaneous birth as a complete being.

"What kinds of beings," one may ask, "have which of the different states of
birth?" All four types of birth exist with humans. An example of instant,
complete birth would be humans of the very first eon. The king called "Let-
Me-Nurse-You" would typify birth from warmth and moisture. A case of
humans born from eggs would be the elders Drak and Nyedrak, who were
offspring of a shipwrecked merchant who coupled with a female crane.
Another such instance would be that of Sagala, a woman with laywoman's
vows, who gave 32 eggs from which 32 boys sprang forth. Yet another case
would be that of the queen of King Panchala, who gave 500 eggs. These were
put into a chest that was thrown into the Ganges River. A Lichavi youth saw
the chest while washing--and when he opened the lid, 500 boys sprang forth.
Examples of birth from the womb would be the majority of humans of present
times.

,DUD 'GRO LA SKYE GNAS RNAM PA BZHI YOD DE, NAM MKHA' LDING SKYE GNAS BZHI PAS, KLU SKYE GNAS BZHI GA BZA' BAR BSHAD PA'I PHYIR,
All four types of birth exist with animals--we see an explanation that "The
great garuda birds, who can be born in any of the four different ways, devour
the serpent-like nagas, themselves born in all four different ways."

Hell beings and the beings of pleasure, as well as beings between their lives,
are born instantly, complete in every way. This is because they possess
tremendous energy coming from their past deeds. The majority of craving
spirits are born complete, but there are also those that are born from the
womb. As a certain craving spirit, a female one, said to the great and revered
Maudgalyayana:

One might ask the following: "Which of these kinds of birth are better?"
Complete birth, birth from warmth and moisture, birth from the womb, and
birth from an egg are each a better type of birth than the next. This is because
the first is a way to take birth without hurting anyone, neither oneself nor
another. With the next type, there is no harm to another. And with the last
two types of birth, you undergo pain yourself, respectively, either once or
twice.

Someone may raise the following objection:
If complete birth is a better way to take birth, then why didn't
King Siddhartha take birth complete? After all, he was a
bodhisattva in his final life, one who had achieved the power to
take any birth he pleased. What purpose was served by taking
birth from the womb?

He did have a purpose: first of all, he wanted to lead his relatives of the
Shakya clan to the Teaching. Secondly, his human followers would be inspired
to emulate him. Lastly, he wanted to avoid any possibility of raising
suspicions in people who might think to themselves that our Teacher was a
wizard, or something similar, if they saw him display great miracles or mystic
power.

Some people claim that the Buddha took birth from the womb in order to be
able to leave his bodily relics behind and thereby attract even more followers
than if he hadn't done so. This is because a person born through instant,
complete birth leaves behind no corpse. Master Vasubandhu though states that
"This is not a correct answer to the question, for we accept that relics are left
behind by force of the holy person's own blessing."

Someone may object to the above explanation that beings born complete leave
no corpse: "Doesn't it contradict the statement that `the great garuda birds, born
complete, devastate the serpent nagas (also born complete) by devouring
them'?" But keep in mind that the expression is "by devouring them"--not "by
having devoured them." You could also say that they devour them only until
they die.

'O NA SKYE GNAS GANG MANG ZHE NA, GANG BZANG BA BZHIN MANG NGO,
One might ask which kinds of birth are the most common. The better the birth
as explained above, the more types of beings born that way.

"In the lines above," one may begin, "you mentioned beings' entering the womb
`because of a mistaken impression.' Does this hold true in every case?" One
type is cognizant of what they are doing while they are entering the womb,
yet lose this awareness during their stay there. Another type is cognizant not
only of entering the womb but while they are staying there too. Still others
are moreover cognizant as they issue from the womb as well. One more type
is ignorant of all three, cognizant of neither entering, nor staying in, nor
issuing from the womb. Those who are born from eggs, even if they are self-
made victors, are always of this last type, and it alone--ignorant. This is what
they say.

"Just who is it," one may ask, "that represents each of these three types--those
who are cognizant of entering the womb but not staying there, and so on?"
Three are the types who enter the womb as such; respectively, wheel-

empowered emperors and the two "self-born"--referring to self-made victors
and Buddhas. They enter as they do due to the fact that they have been able,
respectively, to amass vast collections of deeds (referring in this case to merit),
wisdom, and merit and wisdom both.

Course VIII: Death and the Realms of Existence
Reading Three: The lives of craving spirits, and animals
The following selection is taken from the Great Book on the Steps of the Teaching,
composed by the Kadampa Geshe Drolungpa, Lodru Jungne (c. 1100 AD).

I have already explained how the deeds which lead to a life as a craving spirit
or an animal are precisely medium or lesser instances of the ten wrong actions.
Now I will describe these two kinds of beings themselves, from the point of
view of specific characteristics.

It comes from a part or parts of the ten paths of deeds,
But mostly because the person's misled by his cheapness
Or jealousy and forgets the three kinds of giving.
He neglects to share with all who were offered a thing,
Reduces what was earmarked, or never gives it at all,
Redirects it, prevents it, or anything of the like.
A mind full of this dirt collects a mass of loathsome deeds;
Awesome strong, they drag him down to the life of a craving spirit.

Here a "part" of the ten bad deeds can refer to performing them to a medium
extent, or else to a "part" in the sense of some residual karmic energy from
having performed them to a greater extent. A part or parts like this lead to
this particular rebirth, as do the following deeds described in the text called
Constant Awareness:

Most of these are people who were misled by their own
cheapness, or by their desire for the miserable possessions of this
world, or who were overwhelmed by a hope for the miserable
offerings that are all someone here can present you with. And
because of this they found they could not give to others. They
could not give to any of those who might come to ask: they gave
neither to practitioners of the Dharma, nor to Brahmins, nor the
poor, nor needy, nor destitute. They did no good deeds. They
observed nothing of that great sea of ethical living, neither for
this life, nor for the life beyond. They provided nothing for their
children, or for their wives, or to the men and women who
served them, or to all the others whom it was their responsibility
to sustain with meat and bread. Their cheapness swindled them
out of all they could hope for, in this world and the next. They
are people too who were swindled by their quarreling, or by
jealousy. These for the most part then are the kinds of people
who take birth as craving spirits; and most of them turn into
those craving spirits who are witches.

,DE BZHIN DU BSNGOS NAS MA BYIN PA LA SOGS PA LAS NGAN PA MANG PO DAG GIS KYANG NGO ,
In addition to these kinds of actions there is failing to hand over offerings that
were earmarked for a certain virtuous purpose, and all the rest: a whole mass
of different bad deeds that can lead you to this kind of birth.

Cravings spirits live in two different places, described as follows:
There are those who roam about our world, and then there are
those who stay in their own land. It is sometimes possible for
human beings to catch sight of the first kind, at night. Their own
land is 500 yojana under the ground; except for extraordinary
circumstances, this land is located 3600 yojana from the borders
of Dzambu Continent. This distance though is variable.

They're of three types, distinguished by the obstacles to what
They live on: outer problems and inner, problems with food
Or drink. All of them share though the infinite pain
Of hunger and thirst, intense as the flames of a fire.

The sufferings of these craving spirits can all be reduced to three different
kinds. First are those with outer obstacles to what they need to live on.
People like this approach a place like a mountain spring, or a pond or stream,
and catch sight of something that they could eat or drink. They race ahead to
get it, only to be forced back by beings cutting them with knives, or beating
them with clubs and such. Or else they come to the side of some water and
find themselves unable to drink of it, for then it looks to them like blood and
pus or the like.

Those craving spirits with inner obstacles have mouths no bigger than the eye
of a needle, spouting with flame. Their throats are the size of a guitar string,
but their bellies are huge. Even where there is no one to stop them, and even
when they can locate something to eat or drink, they find themselves unable
to get it down.

Next are the craving spirits with obstacles to what they can eat or drink. An
example would be the spirit whose name was "The Necklace of Flame." Every
single thing this spirit tried to eat, and every single thing it tried to drink as
well, would burn it instead; and whatever went down would anyway never
relieve those feelings of hunger and thirst.

Some of these spirits are referred to as the "ones who eat filth." This refers to
the fact that they are forced to eat feces, and drink urine; they are completely
unable to partake of anything other than putrid, poisonous, disgusting
excrement. Others are constantly cutting off pieces of their own flesh to get
something to eat; they can never find anything which is clean, or fresh.

All of them have the look of a scorched piece of wood; the searing pain of
hunger and thirst have dried up all their skin and flesh and blood. Their
entire look has changed: their faces are covered with hair; their visage is gaunt,
from hunger and thirst; their tongues pass over their lips, dry, and parched.
They run from place to place, terrified, and aimless.

For more detail on the karma and suffering of these spirits, you should study
further the sutras themselves. The further divisions of the spirits into a
multitude of different types all come from particulars of the karma involved
in creating them, which comes itself from the great variety of motivations
present in their past deeds. As such, the full range of different kinds of
suffering, and thoughts, and migrations, and locations of these craving spirits
is simply beyond all reckoning.

deeds, in their actions and speech and thoughts, to an overwhelming degree.
What was the cause of these deeds? All of them are performed relative to
other living beings; it is towards them that we act; and the karma we collect
comes through the way we relate to them, flows from our interaction with
others. We may be wandering again and again through births of misery, but
it seems that still we are not tired of it.

Our minds, like restless monkeys, have lived in the circle of suffering life for
time with no beginning. We have grown accustomed to staying out in a rain
of all kinds of suffering. Weighted down in the shackles of a whole variety of
different bodies, we drag ourselves again and again up the great mountain of
the wheel of rebirth. But still this is something we find hard to realize, to
recognize, for our minds are filled with the habits of our suffering past. We
must seek, from the beginning, to control this restless monkey--the mind
flitting constantly from one thing to another. If we fail in this task we will
only come to the unstoppable torment of the lower realms; locked in the circle
of birth by the enemy of our own minds, we will forever lose any kind of
happiness.

If you want to know then what it is that brings a person to the birth of a
craving spirit, it is primarily the failure to perform the three kinds of giving,
and being overcome by the emotions of cheapness, and jealousy. [The three
kinds of giving are: giving material needs, giving freedom from fear, and
giving the Dharma.]

Their heads are caught in the noose of incredibly
Powerful karma, which drags them helplessly on;
Neither spiritual guides, nor their children or wife,
Nor other loved ones can help them in the least.

The bodily dimensions of beings in all three of the lower realms are nothing
that are fixed; the size of the body they possess, and the suffering that they can
therefore feel, increase according to the power of the karma they have collected
previously. On the whole, the lifespans of craving spirits are nothing which
is fixed; the very longest they can live is five hundred days which each last as
long as a month among human beings.

Next is what comes from a part or parts of bad deeds,
And mainly from lesser forms of the acts of fools,
Collecting bad karma from disregarding, and such.
You fall to an animal birth, killing and eating each other,
Or becoming the property of pleasure beings or men,
Helplessly slaughtered, or forced to do their bidding.

What causes a person to be born as an animal are the parts of the ten bad
deeds which are considered lesser forms of these deeds. In particular are cases
where especially ignorant people disregard minor rules of morality, and do so
on a continual basis; or else where they collect a great number of wrong deeds
such as failing to act with respect towards those who are worthy of such
respect.

How is it that these animals suffer? They kill each other, and use each other
for food: the ones that are bigger, or more powerful, slay and devour the
others, swallowing them even before they have stopped breathing, and such.
Or else they hurt each other, in every imaginable way. Some kinds of animals
become possessions of humans or other types of beings, and are slaughtered
for their meat, or skins, or bones and the rest. Or else they are forced to do the
bidding of their masters; mercilessly and helplessly they are sheared or milked
or herded or saddled or dragged along--whatever their owners wish.

Generally speaking, there are some three hundred and sixty million kinds of
animals: it is stated in scripture, for example, that the human body is itself
home to eighty thousand different animal forms. They come in all different
kinds of appearances; they have all different kinds of bodies; they are born in
all four different ways; they use all four kinds of sustenance; they may get
along with each other, or fight; they may rage, or be peaceful; they might be
friendly, or dangerous; they live in communities, or alone; they have wings, or
have no wings, and so on--there are endless different types, all depending on
the different types of deeds they committed, and the motivations they had.

The "place in the depths" is the ocean, immense, while others

The location of animals known as the "place in the depths" refers to the

animals living above ground, below ground, in the sky, in water, on the bodies
of other creatures, and the rest--they're found virtually everywhere.

It is stated that--

And moisture cannot be born.
This is true because the vast majority of animals as well are born from warmth
and moisture. As for the size of their bodies, there is no fixed size. Their
lifespans too are for the most part indefinite; those with the very longest lives
remain for an eon.

You must consult the sutras if you wish to know more about the places, or the

depths of the sea, and so on. There too you will find all about the details of
the pleasures and pains these beings undergo, all according to the specific
types of karma they have collected. My intention here is to present a
refutation, something to challenge the mistaken viewpoint of those worldly
people who say the world is some glorious, wonderful place.

The Asian Classics Institute
Course VIII: Death and the Realms of Existence
Reading Four: The lives of humans, and pleasure beings
The following selection is taken from the Chest of Riches, by Master Ngulchu
Dharma Bhadra (1772-1851), an important link in the lineage leading from Je
Tsongkapa, through Pabongka Rinpoche, and down to our own root lama, Khen
Rinpoche Geshe Lobsang Tharchin. The work is a commentary on the Path of Ease,
a famous lam-rim text by His Holiness the First Panchen Lama, Lobsang Chukyi
Gyeltsen (1567?-1662).

Here first is the contemplation of the sufferings of cyclic life in general, and
then the contemplation of the individual sufferings of this life. The first of
these is covered in the Great Book on the Steps of the Path in three progressive
stages: the contemplation of the eight kinds of suffering, the contemplation of
the six kinds of suffering, and the contemplation of the three kinds of suffering.
In the Path of Ease though the contemplation of the six sufferings is presented
at this point, and then the first seven of the eight kinds of suffering are applied
specifically to humans in the contemplation of the individual sufferings of life.
As such I will give my own explanation in this same order.

First comes the following resolution, made in the practitioner's mind:
Suppose I am able to give up doing the ten bad deeds, and then
follow the ten good deeds in the proper way. And suppose that,
for this very reason, I pass beyond the suffering of the lower
births and reach up to the level of the higher ones. If though I
fail to reach a freedom where I have eliminated suffering from its
very root, it doesn't matter what kind of body I may be able to
attain in the higher births. The fact that I have not yet gotten rid
of the mental afflictions means that I will never enjoy even a
single instant of happiness.
Right after this, the metaphor of the terrible criminal is presented.

Here the text includes the phrase that begins, "Even though we don't at the
present moment have the suffering of being beaten with a club..." Prior to this
point in the work, two different punishments--the torture of having molten
wax dripped slowly over your body, and being beaten with a club--have been
explicitly mentioned. As such we see nowadays a custom where, when the
text is recited out loud, people add a few words and say, "Even though we
don't at the present moment have the suffering of being tortured with drops

of wax, or beaten with a club..." Nonetheless it appears to me that the point
of this phrase is that, first of all, we who live the life of a pleasure being or
human in the desire realm are free of any constant pain like the torture of
molten wax. Those who live in the higher two realms have neither feelings of
pain nor of [so-called] pleasure, and are thus free of both the suffering of the
wax and the club.

All this is a metaphor for life in the higher states of birth; no matter how good
a rebirth you may gain there, the good karma you have collected in the past,
and which has projected you there, eventually wears out. Then you fall to the
lower births, and begin to experience infinite varieties of pain. The final end
of such a birth then is always something gruesome.

,SDUG BSNGAL DRUG BSAM PA DNGOS NI, BSDOMS LA,
Here next is the actual contemplation of the six forms of suffering. A summary
of these in verse goes as follows:

,SDUG BSNGAL DRUG NI NGES MED NGOM MI SHES,
,YANG YANG LUS 'DOR YANG YANG NYING MTSAMS SBYOR,
,YANG YANG MTHO DMAN DU GYUR GROGS MED PA'O,
Life has no certainty, we know no satisfaction, and shed our bodies
Over and over, take birth again, over and over, go over and over
From high to low, with no companion: and so we suffer, six ways.

The first of the sufferings mentioned here is [1] the fact that life has no
certainity. We have taken birth here, in the cycle of suffering, and by its very
nature our birth has two causes: the pair of our own past deeds, and our
mental afflictions. The only result that can ever come from these two causes
is something which is, in its very essence, pain. And the kinds of pain that
come to us are those in the words that include the line, "Enemies turn to those
we love..." The Letter to a Friend describes this suffering as follows:

,PHA NI BU NYID MA NI CHUNG MA NYID,
,SKYE BO DGRAR GYUR PA DAG BSHES NYID DANG ,
,LDOG PA NYID DU MCHI BAS DE SLAD DU,
,'KHOR BA DAG NA NGES PA 'GA' MA MCHIS,
Your father turns to your very own son, your mother to your wife;
And the one who was your enemy becomes a relative dear to you.
The complete reverse of this happens too, and thus it is we say
That in the circle of life there is no certainty at all.

What this verse is saying is that it is possible for the person who was your
father in your last life to turn into your son in this life. Your mother in your
last life then can turn to your wife in this one. Your worst enemy can turn
into your dearest relative, and the complete reverse of all these can happen as
well: your son in your past life turns into your father in this one, and all the
rest--there is no absolutely no certainty who is who. And that's not all. Even
in this present life, we can see with our own two eyes how uncertain life can
be: a person who was ready to murder someone the year before becomes in the
following year their bosom friend, and so on. People though grasp to the
occasional appearance that these relationships are something that are certain,
and then begin to feel strong emotions of attachment, or anger. These lead
them to spend their lives helping some people, and hurting others. They act
like some kind of animal, dazed and confused, wandering aimlessly across
some great wasteland. The animal runs, with no idea what it does, exhausting
itself in the pursuit of what seems to be some great goal. And then some man
appears and shouts at it, "What are you doing!" And then the animal reverses
direction, and runs just as purposefully the opposite way. So give up now this
tendency you have of making any distinction between your friends and your
enemies, this habit of liking the friends, and disliking the enemies. Come to
realize that there is not a single object in this entire suffering life that you can
trust. Study to find disgust for this kind of existence.

,NGOM MI SHES PA NI, 'KHOR BA'I BDE BA JI TZAM SPYAD KYANG ZHES SOGS TE,
The next suffering, [2] the fact that we can never find any sense of satisfaction,
is described in the words that include, "No matter what kind of happiness you
find here in the circle of suffering life..." The verse here is:

,RE RES RGYA MTSO BZHI LAS LHAG PA YI,

,SKYE BO'I RJES SU 'BRANG BA'I 'KHOR BA PAS,
,DE BAS CHES MANG NYID GCIG BTUNG 'TSAL LO,
Each one of us has fed upon a massive amount of milk
Exceeding the water in all four seas; and those still living within
This suffering life, who follow the way of ordinary beings,
Can still expect to drink a measure infinitely more.

The point of the verse is as follows. Suppose that you could manage to bring
back, and collect together all the mothers' milk that you had ever fed upon in
all the different bodies you have taken upon yourself. The massive amount of
this milk would exceed the water in all four seas. The "four seas" here are
different parts of the greater outer ocean, named from the four different hues
of its four quarters as the colors of Mount Supreme reflect upon them.
Even the deepest parts of these seas, and their other distances, are something
that it is possible to measure; yet the number of births that you and I have
taken are limitless in number. As such we have already drunk more milk of
our mothers than the water these seas hold in them. And if we continue the
way we are, if we go on following the life of ordinary beings, failing to practice
the path, then we can still expect to drink a measure of milk which is infinitely
more.

The meaning of the words "a measure infinitely more" is not "infinitely more
than what they drank before," since the milk we have sucked in the past is
itself beyond all measurement. The point rather is that we will from this point
on be forced to drink again a quantity that is greater than all the water in the
four seas.

The whole point of enjoying things which are pleasant is to bring ourselves
some kind of contentment. The fact though is that, no matter how much
pleasure we may feel with a thing in this cycle of suffering, we never reach
any sense of satisfaction. Much less; for the normal reaction is that our feelings
of attachment grow more, and this forces us to wander around even longer in
the circle of life. And what the pleasures end up bringing to us are great many
different kinds of suffering--unbearable pains that dwarf the pleasures
themselves.

So too there was in days long ago a wonderful child who was born from the
head of a king named Gupali. The child was named "Headborn," and known
as well as "Nurse-from-me." The astrologers foretold that he would someday
be the emperor of the world.
This prince sought to make great efforts in doing good deeds, in order to
provide for the food, clothing, and other needs of his people. After inquiring
into the ways of bringing this about, he made great prayers that his subjects
would be able to find the food, clothing, and other needs without any effort at
all. As a result, people began to get anything they wished for: crops sprang
forth without anyone ever planting them; jewels fell like raindrops from the
sky; clothing grew like leaves from the branches of wonderful trees; and the
like.
Because of the incredible force of the good deeds he had done, Headborn came
to be emperor over our entire world, the continent of Dzambu.

Dissatisfied with only this much, he then went to the eastern continent of
Greatbody, and took it over as well. Dissatisfied with only this much, he then
went to the western continent of Cattle-Users, and took it over as well.
Dissatisfied with only this much, he hen went to the northern continent of
Unpleasant Sound and took it over as well. Dissatisfied with only this much,
he went to the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, and appropriated half the throne
of Shakra, the king of the full pleasure beings. He reigned there with this
being, for the length of 137 years.
Then, during the time of the Buddha named Kashyapa, a war with the lesser
pleasure beings broke out. Even Shakra found himself unable to repulse them,
but Headborn was successful. Then an evil thought began to form in his mind:
dissatisfied with the idea of continuing to share his power with Shakra, he
decided that he would have to murder the being.
This single thought erased all the good energy that was keeping Headborn in
this realm, and he fell back to Dzambu Continent. Not long after that he was
on his deathbed, ready to pass on to the next world. His ministers crowded
around him, and asked the mighty being what it was that could force him to

leave them so. And then it was that he gave his famous reply, describing how
his bad thoughts had brought him to death, and so on.

The next suffering is [3] the fact that we have to shed our bodies, over and
over. This is indicated in the lines that include, "It doesn't matter what
wonderful kind of body I may be able to attain..." The point here is that,
regardless of all the bad deeds we might accumulate in order to maintain this
body we have now, it is an absolute certainty that--in the end--we will be
forced to shed it. The power of the wrong deeds we did for the sake of the
body though we carry along in our mind, and they bring to us the eventual
result of unbearable pain.
Beyond this are the lines that say,
The size of the stack of rotting corpses
belonging to each of us
Would exceed an equivalent to the height
of Mount Supreme itself.
Suppose that you could put together a huge stack of all the skeletons left from
the bodies that any particular person had ever taken on, and then left behind.
This stack would be more immense than Summit, the great mountain at the
middle of the world.
The difficult expression nyechik here is meant to indicate "a quantity equivalent
to the height," which is then exceeded.

The next suffering is [4] the fact that we have to take birth again, over and
over. The text at this point includes the line, "Since we have, for time with no
beginning, been forced to take birth again, over and over..."
The Tibetan expression for "taking birth again" here is nying tsam jorwa, and is
somewhat unusual. The nying means "again," and appears with the same sense
in a number of other terms. One is nying-gu, "ultimate goal," or the further
goal within a goal. Another is nying-lak, "appendage," meaning a further limb
[such as a finger] splitting off from what is already a limb [such as an arm].
The point of the expression nying tsam jorwa then is to emphasize that, during
our lives in this circle of suffering, we have not just crossed the border [tsam
jorwa] between death and life at some isolated instance in the past, but rather
that we have done so again and again [nying].

Beyond this we see the lines that say,
Suppose you tried to count the mothers all the way back
to the beginning, using tiny balls
Of earth the size of juniper berries; the fact though is that
the planet would not be enough.
Suppose, says the verse, that you took tiny bits of dirt from this massive planet
Earth and rolled them up into little balls the size of juniper berries. Then you

used them to count all the mothers: you start with the one who was your
mother this time, and then her mother, and then her mother's mother, and so
on. The dirt contained in the entire planet would run out before you finished
your counting.

The next suffering is [5] the fact that we have to go from a high position to a
low position, over and over again. This is indicated in the lines that include,
"No matter how many good things you get in this cycle of suffering..." As the
verse says,
First you reach the level of the one named Shakra,
and merit the gifts of everyone in the world;
Then because of the force of past deeds done
you fall again to the surface of the earth.
First you reach the level of an emperor
who with the wheel reigns over all the world;
Then in the realms of the circle of birth
you become again the lowest of slaves.

As the Word of the Discipline says,
A high position eventually leads to a fall,
And relationships always come to separation;
Life itself leads in its end to death.
The point here is that any good thing that ever happens here in the circle of
suffering life eventually turns into some kind of problem. Try to concentrate

on this pattern that life shows us: how we always go from something high to
something low. Try to develop a healthy disgust for this kind of existence.

The final suffering is [6] the fact that we have no companion. This suffering
is indicated in the lines about "going by oneself, alone, with no companion at
all..." As the Bodhisattva's Life says,
Consider even just the body we have;
If the flesh and bone that come with it
Must one day rot and be parted from it,
What need then to talk of our other friends?
All who are born are born alone,
And all who die by themselves;
Since they can't share the slightest bit of your pain,
What use are the friends that hold you back?
As the verse points out, we tend to collect a great variety of different bad
deeds for the sake of our friends. But when the time comes to experience the
consequences of these actions, none of these same friends can participate in our
pain at all. And in those situations where we try to practice some Dharma,
these friends tend to hold us back. So what use are they, anyway?

The Asian Classics Institute
Course VIII: Death and the Realms of Existence
Reading Five: Beings in the intermediate state (the bardo)
The following selection is taken from the Illumination of the Path to Freedom, a
commentary by Gyalwa Gendun Drup, His Holiness the First Dalai Lama, on the
Treasure House of Higher Knowledge (Abhidharma Kosha), written by the
Buddhist master Vasubandhu in the fourth century AD. Master Vasubandhu's root
text verses do not appear in the original of the commentary, and have been inserted
at the appropriate points. Parts of these verses woven into the commentary have been
printed in bold to show the close connection of the two works, and section headings
have been provided for clarity.

These are the beings who occur between
The being at death here, and the one at birth.
Because they have not reached their destination,
The beings between are not yet arrived.
[III.37-40]

"You have stated," one may begin, "that the inbetween being is born complete.
What is the basic nature of those beings who are between lives?" They may
be described as those beings who occur between the point of the being at
death here with the present stream of heaps and the point of the being at
birth. These between beings are though not yet "arrived," for they have yet
to reach the destination towards which they travel.

GNYIS PA LA, RIGS PA DANG LUNG GI SGRUB BYED GNYIS, DANG PO NI,
Next come the proofs for the existence of such beings. These consist of two
types: proofs based on logic and proofs based on scriptural authority.

Because it's a thing like grain continuing,
It doesn't occur from that being's end.
Because this image does not exist, and since
They are dissimilar, it's no example.
First, there are no two together in one.
Second, not the continuation, by two.
[III.41-6]

Now a member of the "Majority Group" of philosophers might come and say
that there is no being between death and birth--that the being at birth comes
right from the end of the being at death. Consider though the being at birth.
It doesn't just occur from the end of the being at death, because it is a thing
that goes along in a stream of consecutive stages, continuing on like the seeds
for crops of grain. [That is, a seed turning into a fully developed plant
requires the inbetween stage of a young sprout. Just so, an inbetween life is
required for the being to move from the location of death to the location of
rebirth. (This explanation is from the famed commentary of Chim Jampay
Yang.)]

Someone may make the following objection:
A continuum doesn't necessitate a medium. The reflection of
some image in a mirror is, for example, a continuation of that
image--yet goes on cut off from the image.

SHES BYA CHOS CAN, ME LONG NANG GI BYAD BZHIN GYI GZUGS BRNYAN BYAD BZHIN GYI RGYUN YIN PA DE, SKYE SRID 'CHI SRID KYI RGYUN YIN YANG DE LAS CHAD CING 'JUG PA'I DPE YANG DAG MA YIN PAR THAL, ME LONG NANG GI BYAD BZHIN GYI GZUGS BRNYAN BYAD BZHIN GYI NGO BOR MA GRUB PA'I PHYIR TE, GO SA GCIG NA LHAN CIG TU GZUGS GYI DNGOS PO RDZAS THA DAD PA GNYIS MED PA'I PHYIR,
We reply in the classical form of a proof:
Consider all existent things.

Isn't the way in which in which the reflection of an image in a
mirror is a continuation of that image not a good example
to describe how the being at birth can go on cut off from
the being at death but still be its continuation?
Because doesn't the reflection of the image in a mirror not even
exist in the way that the image does? Because isn't it true
that there are no two separate things that both have form
and can both stand together in one point in space at the
same time?

And isn't our argument sound for yet another reason? Since aren't they two
dissimilar things--the way in which the reflection of the image in the mirror
is the continuation of that image, and the way in which the being at birth is a
continuation of the being at death? Because isn't it true that the reflection is
not really the continuation of the image? Isn't it also true that the reflection
of the image is brought about by two principal causes--the image itself and
a good, clean mirror; whereas the being at birth is something that comes from
the being at death, not from any combination of two different principal causes?
 GNYIS PA NI,
We turn next to the scriptural proof.

Scriptural Proof of Inbetween Beings

,MGUR NAS GSUNGS PHYIR YOD DRI ZA,

They are, from his lips, who live on smells.

Beings in the state between death and rebirth are something that exist, as we
hear from the Victor's own lips in the sutra on The Seven Types of Lives, where
it mentions "There are seven types of lives: life as a hell being," and so on.

Another sutra concurs:
If three conditions are present, a child will form in the mother's
womb. These are (1) a being suitable to be a mother, and who
is still menstruating; (2) a feeling of desire and then sexual
contact between the prospective parents; and (3) the proximity of
one of the beings who live on smells.
This proves the existence of the intermediate being first because it comes from
the Buddha, and secondly because the phrase "beings who live on smells" in
the quotation refers to none other than the intermediate being.

Someone may object to the last point, citing the common reading that goes
"...the proximity of the cessation of the heaps." This position though is
mistaken. The sutra called Son of Talen states:
Your "being who lives on smells" stands in close proximity,
whether he be one for royalty, one for the Brahmin caste, for
aristocracy, or for the common man; whether he stands to the
east or...
The end of some heaps could hardly be described this way.

The intermediate being can also be said to exist in that five different types of
non-returners, including those who "pass beyond" during the intermediate
state, are taught in scripture. Some may claim that this type only refers to a
certain kind of pleasure being, but if this were the case then other types such
as "those who pass beyond after rebirth" would also have to be some kind of
pleasure being.

Proof of the intermediate being comes too from the sutra called The Seven
Births of the Holy, where types that pass beyond during the intermediate state
are further divided into those that pass quickly and so on.

Someone might raise the following objection:
If intermediate beings did exist it would contradict the teaching
about the demon named "Destroyer," who with a fist of stone
cracked the skull of Wiseman's Delight, a disciple of the Buddha
known as Light Protector. The disciple died and flames
immediately enveloped the body of the demon, who then took
birth in the hells.

SKYON MED DE, TSE DE NYID LA MTHONG CHOS LA MYONG 'GYUR GYI LAS SMIN PA YIN GYI, SKYES NAS MYONG 'GYUR PHYIS SMIN PAR 'GYUR BA'I PHYIR,
There is though no contradiction. The flames were not part of a result that
ripened in the next life from a misdeed in this life--that came later. They
were, rather, one of those results of a deed that ripens and returns to one in
the very same life.

Yet another objection may be raised: if there is supposed to be a state between
death and rebirth, what about the explanation that one takes birth in the hells
"right after" he commits any one of the five immediate misdeeds? Yet there
is no problem. The word "immediate" here is meant to refer to the fact that a
person who has committed such a deed can take his next birth only in the
hells, and nowhere else. Otherwise a person would logically take his birth in
the hells the moment after he actually committed the deed.

One last objection could be offered, that the postulation of an intermediate
being is at odds with the statement that
The Transcendent Victor spoke these words to the evil Brahmin:
Brahmin, you will come into the presence of the Lord of Death,
Ere you live to any old age, or meet with some kind of sickness.
There will be no place between, nowhere you can stop and stay;
No need for you to prepare provisions for the journey.

SKYON MED DE, DE NI MI'I NANG DU YUN RING DU MI GNAS PA TZAM LA DGONGS PA'I PHYIR, GSUM PA NI,
Again though there is no problem. The only point of the words was to tell the
Brahmin that he hadn't long to remain among humans.
Having thus completed proofs for the existence of intermediate beings, we turn
to a description of their bodily images.
13
Bodies of Intermediate Beings

Because the force projecting them's the same,
He has the image of the being "before."
This is the one that's after the moment of birth,
Before the point that one has already died.
[III.49-52]

What does the body of an inbetween being look like? The being between
death and rebirth has the image of the being "before," or the being which is
going to come into existence. This is because both the intermediate being and
the being of the next life are thrown into the future by the same projecting
force--the deeds they did in the past. This expression, the "being before," is
meant to refer to the one that consists of the five (or four) heaps that exist
before the point that one has already died (up through the moment of death)
but after the moment of birth (the second moment of birth and so on).

What color is an intermediate being? An inbetween being headed for the hells
has the color of a scorched stump of wood. Those to be animals are the color
of smoke; craving spirits have a look like water. Those to become pleasure
beings of the desire realm, or humans, possess a golden color. Inbetween
beings for the form realm are white. No intermediate being exists for the
formless realm, as there is no form there.

How big are intermediate beings? Those to become pleasure beings of the
desire realm, or humans, are the size of five or six-year old children. Those
headed for the form realm possess more of a sense of shame and conscience
than not, so have the body of a mature adult and are fully clothed at birth.
Those of the desire realm have a greater share of shamelessness and a lack of
conscience, so are naked at their birth. There was though the nun known as
"Lady of White," who was born with clothes by force of her former prayers to
that effect. Bodhisattvas in their final life are as well from infancy possessed
of the special bodily signs and marks, and clothing.

"Your above description of intermediate beings," one may object, "appears to
contradict the dream that the Buddha's mother had, of a white baby elephant
entering her womb prior to the Buddha's birth." There is though no such
inconsistency. The dream was only meant to represent certain symbolic
points--something like the ten portents that were shown in the dreams of King
Kirki.

Someone might continue the argument, citing the verse from the venerable
saint, Subhuti:
He made his entry, taking his place in the womb of the Mother with
Full knowledge, cognizant as saints who know where they'll be born,
And having first assumed the form of an elephant of white,
A body embellished with six tusks of ivory, and four legs.
This reading though is only meant to match the Mother's dream.

"How long then," one may ask, "does a being stay in the intermediate state?"
The Sutrist called the "Venerable Layman with Vows" makes the claim that
"There is no fixed time: the intermediate being remains in this state until all the
factors necessary for birth have come together." And the master Vasumitra
claims that "they stay for a period of seven days. If by the end of this time
they have failed to find a new birth, they die and migrate into yet another
intermediate state." Still others claim that the intermediate being stays for
seven weeks--a total of 49 days.

The Detailists make another claim:
A being in the intermediate state is one in an active search for his
rebirth, so his conception into a new birth occurs relatively
quickly, before he has spent any great amount of time in this
state. If his birth in a certain place is a fixed thing but the
necessary factors have not yet assembled, the force of his past
deeds will pull these factors together and he will take birth there.
If his birth in the particular place is not a fixed thing, he will then
simply take birth somewhere else.

Suppose too that it is winter and someone has reached an intermediate state
from which he is supposed to take rebirth as a cow. Since cows mate in the
summer, he will instead take birth as a similar animal without a definite
mating season. If in winter also a person has come to an intermediate state
from which he is meant to take birth as a horse, we will instead be born as a
donkey--since donkeys mate in any season, but horses in spring.

If again in summer a person has reached the state between death and rebirth
and is supposed to be born as a bear, he will take birth as a dre-creature. They
mate in no particular season, while bears mate only in the winter. If, finally,
it is summer and a person has become an intermediate being meant to be born
as a dog, he'll take his rebirth as a wolf: they mate any time, dogs only in
autumn.

This all supports the quotation that says, "They turn from what they were; they
collect new forces of the kind that come from deeds." Moreover, the "collection
of new forces" mentioned here refers to a collection of new forces of the kind
that come from deeds in this life and produce their results here in the very
same life. This confirmation that the inbetween being is capable of collecting
new deeds that will bring him a result in this life itself confirms that he can
collect the other two types: those that produce a result that is experienced in
the very next life, and those that lead to a result experienced in lives beyond
the next. This is what they claim.

,BZHI PA NI,
We now turn to the fourth of our five points on intermediate beings. Here we
discuss their various special features.

"Who," one may ask, "can see an intermediate being?" Intermediate beings, at
least those of the same type, can be seen by each other. Some people have
claimed that intermediate beings headed for a birth as a pleasure being can see
those for all the other types of beings, and that intermediate beings to be born
as humans, craving spirits, animals, and hell-beings can each see all but the
preceding types.

Intermediate beings can also be seen by using what is called the "eye of a god."
It must be one which is clear, free of the eleven typical faults. These eleven
are (1) doubt, (2) failing to direct one's attention properly, (3) improper
physical states, (4) a feeling of dullness or sleepiness, (5) mental excitation, (6)
an excessive application of effort, (7) vacant mental wandering, (8) anxiety, (9)
too many different ideas, (10) talking too much, and (11) trying too hard to
meditate.

Intermediate beings have a capability to perform miraculous feats that comes
through the power of deeds. They can fly through the sky, and display a
special strength, or capacity to travel at extraordinary speeds. All their
powers, those of the eye and the rest, are complete--and they have the ability
to pass through mountains and so forth without being stopped. Evidence of
this fact is the presence of frogs and other types of creatures found in the
middle of rocks with no openings at all.

"Is it then possible," one may ask, "for a person to be diverted to another type
of birth after he has already taken form as an intermediate being headed for
the hells?" You are never diverted to another birth: the energy of one's past

deeds which is throwing forth the intermediate being headed for the hells is
the same energy that will project the being "before"--that is, the hell being
itself.
One can however reach the state of an intermediate being headed for the level
known as "Class of the Pure" and still not have to take birth there: cases where
one achieves nirvana between death and rebirth, as just such a being, do exist.

One may ask whether intermediate beings of the desire realm eat any physical
types of food. It is stated that those ones eat no gross kinds of physical food,
but rather live on mere smells. And the more powerful consume the good
smells, while the less powerful must eat the poor ones.

"How does an intermediate being," one may begin, "enter his particular state
of birth?" If he is an inbetween being headed for a birth as a human, he sees
his parents from a distance, having sex together. Because of a mistaken
impression, and imagining that he can play and enjoy himself, he passes to
his destination within the womb, lodged in the midst of the mother's abdomen
and entrails.

If the child is to be a boy, it lies crouched up on the right side of the mother's
abdomen, facing her back. If it is to be a girl, the child lies to the left side of
the abdomen, facing the front. A child to be born as a neuter lies in either
position, depending on whether masculine or feminine types of desire
dominate his personality.

As for the other types of intermediate beings, those headed for a birth from
warmth and moisture pass to their destination from an attraction for the
smells there. Those to be born complete come to their destination from an
attraction for the place itself.
Someone might object: "How could anyone be attracted to the hells?" Yet they
are--all based on a mistaken impression.

What does an intermediate being look like as he travels to his goal? Those
headed for the hells travel upside-down. As sutra states,
Those who berate the saints--accomplished ones
With vows unstained and mighty asceticisms--
Can only fall, travelling down into the hells,
Passing with bodies upside-down.

It is stated that intermediate beings to be born as pleasure beings travel along
in an upward direction. All of the others, those to be humans and the rest,
travel on a level plane. The master Purnavardhana states that inbetween
beings headed for a birth as a craving spirit go along like craving spirits
themselves, facing backwards.

the Various Types of Sustenance

"What," one may ask, "keeps beings alive in these three realms?" Beings are
kept alive by sustenance, for as sutra states:

Not long after the Teacher had become enlightened, he gave
voice to a certain teaching, to the effect that beings are kept alive
by sustenance.

We next treat this point in greater detail, in three divisions concerning (1) the
nature of sustenance; (2) incidentally, different names used to refer to
intermediate beings; and (3) a rationale for the number of the different types
of sustenance.
46
The Nature of Solid Food

,RANG DBANG GROL LA MI PHAN PHYIR,
Solid food exists in the desire;
Combination of three of the doors of sense.
The door of sense that's form is not, because
It neither aids its power nor the free.
[III.153-6]

,DANG PO NI, 'GRO BA ZAS KYIS GNAS PA YIN, , ZHES BSHAD NA, ZAS DE LA DU ZHE NA, DE LA BZHI YOD DE, KHAMS KYI ZAS, REG PA'I ZAS, SEMS PA'I ZAS, RNAM SHES KYI ZAS RNAMS SU YOD PA'I PHYIR,
"In the lines above," one may begin, "you mentioned that `beings are kept alive
by sustenance.' Just how many kinds of sustenance are there?" There are four
different kinds: sustenance in the form of solid food, contact, mental
movement, and consciousness.

'O NA DE DAG KHAMS GANG NA YOD CE NA, KHAM KYI ZAS NI 'DOD PA NA YOD KYI, KHAMS GONG MA DAG NA MED DE, KHAM ZAS LA 'DOD CHAGS DANG BRAL BA DAG DER SKYE BA'I PHYIR, DMYAL BA CHEN PO NA KHAM ZAS JI LTAR YOD CE NA, YOD DE, LCAGS KYI THO LUM DANG ZANGS ZHUN ME 'BAR BA KHAR 'JUG PAR BSHAD CING , NYI TSE BA DANG NYE 'KHOR BA NA MI'I ZAS JI LTAR BA BZHIN YOD PAR DGE 'DUN SRUNGS DANG GRO BZHIN SKYES KYI GTAM RGYUD LAS SHES SO,
"In what realms are they found?" one may ask. Solid food exists in the desire
realm, but not in the realms above it, for it is just those beings who have freed
themselves of desire for solid food who are born in these upper realms.
Someone may ask how there can be any solid food in the great hells. And yet
there is, for it is said that flaming iron balls and molten copper are forced into
the mouths of the beings living in these hells. Moreover we can understand
from the accounts of Gendun Sung and Shrona that in the partial and adjacent
hells there are kinds of food resembling those of the human realm.

Some may object that this explanation seems to contradict the following words
of the Treatise:
What is solid food? Any portion of a substance which, when
used as food, nurtures the various powers, and supports and
promotes the development of the major elements of the body.
Yet there is no contradiction. This explanation was given only with reference
to food as part of a nurturing process; iron balls or the like can be said to
satisfy the definition of food in that they do exhibit the ability to remove a
feeling of hunger.

"What," one may ask, "is the basic nature of solid food?" It is a combination
of three of the doors of sense: smell, taste, and the tangible. Why is it referred
to as "solid food" [literally, "portion food"]? It is so named because it is food
which is ingested only after it has been divided into portions by three agents:
nose, tongue, or body.

"Consider then," one may object, "the smells and tastes of sunshine or shade.
Are they then not a kind of solid food? Because isn't it impossible to ingest
them by cutting them first into portions of some certain size?" It's true that
this would be impossible; nonetheless, they do fit the general description of
solid sustenance. You could also say that our description is intended to fit
only the majority of instances.

The door of sense that is form is not a kind of solid food, because it does not
aid in the nurturing process of "its power" (i.e., the power which takes this
form as its object) or of the power's basis. Nor is it similar to the general class
of things that do perform such a function.

"To this I disagree," one may reply. "Isn't it possible for sensations of pleasure
and happiness to arise when one looks upon a meal laid out in a particularly
attractive manner?" In this case though we would describe the sustenance as
that consisting of contact involving an experience of pleasure through focussing
on the meal. The point is not that this form, the object of the eye, is
functioning as sustenance. If it were, it would also have to produce some
beneficial effect even in beings that are free: enemy destroyers or those that
need never return. The fact though is that such form does not in any way aid
them.
47
Three More Forms of Sustenance

,REG DANG SEMS PA RNAM SHES NI,

Contact, mental movement, and consciousness

"You have mentioned," one may begin, "sustenance consisting of contact, and
so on. Just what is the nature of each of these types of sustenance?" Contact,
mental movement, and consciousness that come with stain are each a kind of
sustenance. In their unstained form they can't be called sustenance, for
sustenance is defined by its function of perpetuating this suffering life, whereas
the stainless act to bring it to a stop. As sutra says,

It functions to keep alive those beings who have already come
out, and to nourish them; it functions to provide aid to those still
in the state of seeking their next life.

ZAS BZHI NI NAD DANG 'BRAS DANG ZUG RNGU'I RTZA BA YIN NO, , RGA SHI'I RKYEN YIN NO, , ZHES GSUNGS LA, ZAG MED DE LTA MIN PA'I PHYIR,
It also states,
The four types of sustenance are the very root of sickness, cancer,
agony. They help bring about old age and death.
Stainless things could hardly be described this way.

One may ask how many of the different types of sustenance function to keep
beings alive, and to provide aid to them. All of them do. One then might ask
again:
Let us admit that movement of the mind (since it is, after all, by
nature a deed) acts--along with the consciousness and contact
linked up with it--to bring a being into existence, and to provide
aid to those who are still in search of a rebirth. How can solid
food though work to bring a being into existence?
But it can: solid food can bring one into a new existence by power of his
craving for it.

SHES KYIS, SEMS CAN GNAS PAR BYED PA YIN MOD, SEMS PAS JI LTAR GNAS PAR BYED CE NA,
One may pose still another question:
Admitted that solid food and contact involving an experience of
pleasure, as well as the consciousness linked with this contact,
can all function to keep a sentient being alive. But how can
movement of the mind perform this function?

The answer is that movement of the mind involving the emotion of hope can
actually keep one alive. We see for example the story of a father who couldn't
bear the thought of dying, along with his two sons, during a famine. He took
a bag full of powder and tied it fast, telling his sons that the chaff was flour.
As long as they entertained this hope, it kept them from dying. When they
opened the bag and saw the chaff, they lost hope, and thus expired.

We also see mention of shipwrecked merchants adrift in the sea, who
mistakenly took far-off whitecaps to be dry land. As long as they had hope it
kept them alive, but when they realized their mistake and lost this hope they
straightaway died. The Types of Beings also describes certain great creatures
that crawl up out of the water to bury their eggs beneath the sandy beach. As
long as the mother creature keeps her eggs in mind, they remain fresh. If she
forgets about them, so it is said, they spoil.

,SLOB DPON NI, DE LTA NA GZHAN MA'I SEMS PA BU'I ZAS SU THAL BA'I SKYON YOD PAS, SGO NGAS MA DRAN NA MI 'DRUL, MA DRAN NA 'DRUL PA'I DON YIN NO, , ZHES GSUNG ,
The Master though objects to this explanation:
If this were true, then the movement of the mother's mind would
have to be sustenance for the young, which is illogical. The point
is, rather, that the beings in the eggs are kept from spoiling as
long as they recall their mother, and spoil when they forget.

The Pandit makes a counterclaim that "This position is itself mistaken: the root
text itself states that `one is ignorant all,' and that `this is always the case with
those from eggs.'" He is himself in error though, for the mental states of failing
to recall something on one hand and total ignorance on the other are not
exclusive of one another.
48
Realms and Three Types of Sustenance

   GSUM DAG NA,
These in three.
[III.158b]

In what realms are these three types of sustenance found? These are found in
all three realms. One might ask whether everything that can be made into
portions can also act as sustenance which nurtures the powers and their basis.
All four combinations are possible in this regard. First consider types of
smells, tastes, or tangibles which come in portions but do harm to the powers
and their basis. They are an example of something which exists in portions but
which is not a kind of sustenance which nurtures the powers and this basis.
 ZAS LHAG MA GSUM NI DBANG PO RTEN BCAS RGYAS PA'I ZAS YIN LA KHAM MA YIN, GNYIS KA YIN PA NI KHAM DU BYAS PAS DBANG PO RTEN BCAS RGYAS PAR 'GYUR BA'I ZAS LTA BU, GNYIS KA MA YIN PA NI SGRA DANG SDUG BSNGAL 'KHOR BCAS SO,
The final three types of sustenance provide an example of something which is
sustenance nurturing the powers and their basis but which is not something
made into these physical portions. An example of both would be any kind of
sustenance which, once taken in portions, produced a nurturing effect upon the
powers and their basis. A case of neither would be, finally, something like
sound or suffering with its attendant phenomena.

"If something produces a deleterious effect upon the powers and their basis,"
one may assert, "it could never be referred to as `solid food.'" Even if it
produces a harmful effect at some future date, we may nonetheless properly
refer to something as solid food on the basis that, for the time being, it has a
beneficial influence. This is because the food is performing a function on two
different occasions.

"Now the Victorious Buddha," one may continue, "spoke that the result of
offering food to a single ordinary being staying in the dzambu-tree grove was
greater than that of the same offering of food to a hundred non-Buddhist sages
who had managed to free themselves of desire for the objects of the senses.
Who was he referring to in the expression `ordinary being staying in the
dzambu-tree grove'?"
Some claim that the reference is to everyone on Dzambu with a stomach, but
this is incorrect since it contradicts the specific mention of a single being.
Moreover the force of the comparison would be lost, there being no great
wonder that giving to so many people would outweigh the other act.

Others have claimed that the words refer to a bodhisattva who has reached the
point where only a certain, fixed time remains before he achieves the final goal.
The Detailists on their part claim that this interpretation is incorrect, since
giving to such a being would be an act of much greater merit than that of
making offerings to ten million enemy destroyers, and that the words are
therefore meant to refer to bodhisattvas who have reached the state conducive
to certain separation from suffering [i.e., the path of preparation].

The Master though rebuts this position:
This could never be correct--first because of the incongruity
between the being to which the name supposedly refers and the
nature of the name itself. Moreover, in no sutra or classical
commentary at all do we see bodhisattvas who have reached the
state conducive to their certain separation from suffering referred
to as bodhisattvas residing in the dzambu-tree grove. Therefore
the being in question is a bodhisattva who has managed to
develop the first concentration level sitting at the base of a
dzambu tree, and who has gained his every goal. From the point
of view of his having overcome any desire for the objects of the
desire realm, the bodhisattva is in no way distinguished from the
non-Buddhists mentioned. His vast superiority is nonetheless
reflected in the fact that giving to this single person constitutes
so much greater merit than giving to the hundred others.

Someone might ask whether making offerings to such a person wouldn't be a
greater merit than giving to an absolutely infinite number of the non-Buddhists
mentioned. Admittedly it would be, he says; the word "hundred" is employed
here first to maintain a continuity in composition, since in passages of the sutra
preceding the one in question the word constantly appears: "You could give
something to a hundred beings living in the animal state of birth, yet still look
forward to results a hundred times more powerful maturing from the deed of
offering something to a single human being, even an immoral one."

Here then are the beliefs of the Knowledge school of philosophers on how it
stays, this great vessel of the world. According to their system, the
foundation that lies below this world first consisted of nothing but empty
space. Then began a portent of the formation of a new world: a gentle force
of wind, swirling about itself over a period of very many years. Eventually it
turned into a great disk of wind, so fierce and solid that even a massive
diamond could never crack it. In thickness, this disc measures one million,
six hundred thousand yojana [about 7 million miles]. Its diameter runs one
"countless" of yojana [about 4.5 times 10 to the 60th power (60 zeroes) miles].

As for the disc of water and gold, a pillar of rain so dense it looks like the
shaft of a oxcart falls then upon that massive disc of wind. This causes the
formation of a great disc of water possessing an inner base of gold. The
measure of this water in its thickness is equal to one million, twenty
thousand yojana [about 4.6 million miles].

One may ask why this water doesn't just roll off the edge of the disc of wind.
Some claim that what holds it on is the power of the past deeds of all living
beings; food that you've eaten, for example, stays without dropping into the
intestines until the stomach has finished dissolving it. Others claim that the
suction of the wind below keeps it on.

Next a great wind stirs up the surface of this water, so much that it gains
solidity and a great disc of gold takes shape. The external thickness of this
formation is as follows. The thickness of the disc of water is now eight

Mount Supreme is made of four different precious things: its eastern side is
silver, the southern side is lapis, the west of ruby, and the north of gold. (The
Comment states that it is the east side that is made of ruby, while the west is
the one with silver.) The color of the sky in each of the quarters running out
from Mount Supreme is determined by the particular precious material on that
side of the mountain: therefore the sky over Dzambu, the southern continent
where we live, appears blue.

"In the lines above," one may begin, "you spoke about `the various continents'
that came `after that.' Just what are these continents?" Among each of these
continents, the first is known as the "Southern Continent of Dzambu." The
name derives from the fact that, first of all, it lies south of the ultimate
mountain--Mount Supreme. "Dzambu" comes from the sound that comes
when the fruit of a dzambu tree drops into the water. And since this mass is
surrounded by water, we call it a "continent." [This is a play on words in the
Sanskrit, where the word for "island" or "continent" is dvi¯pa, meaning "that
which divides the water (ap) into two (dvi)."] The continent runs two
thousand yojana [about 9,000 miles] on each of three different sides. It has
the shape of a wagon, with three and a half yojana on the one remaining
side.

The Eastern Continent, Greatbody, is so named because it lies to the east of

As for the subcontinents, there are eight of these ancillary continents that lie
between the four principal ones. Ancillary to the Eastern Continent are the
subcontinents named Body and Greatbody. Those ancillary to the Northern
Continent are the subcontinents of Terrible Sound and Matching Terrible
Sound. The subcontinents related to the Southern Continent are known as
Oxtail Fan and the Other Oxtail Fan; those around the Western Continent we
call Moving and Path Supreme. Thus there are four pairs of subcontinents,
totalling eight. Humans live on all of them; harmful spirits inhabit Oxtail Fan.

From the eastern side the Ganges, flowing to the sea;

Twenty yojana [about 90 miles] north of Scent of Incense mountain stands a
great golden crag covered with overhangs providing nesting places for birds.
Known as "Obelisk of the Lesser Pleasure Beings," it is square and measures
fifty yojana [225 miles] to a side, or two hundred all round. In height the crag
stands three and a half yojana [about 16 miles]; it possesses a special beauty
very pleasing to the eye. An additional hundred thousand golden crags with
similar overhangs surround the principal one.

Another twenty yojana [90 miles] to the north stands the King of the Sala

Still another twenty yojana, this time to the east, lies a great pool of water

and he sports six tusks. The elephant stands two and a half yojana in height,
and one full yojana in breadth. Two and a half in length, he measures then
seven yojana all round. Another hundred thousand elephants serve as his

living beings. Here we will first complete a basic presentation and then follow
it further to related points. The presentation itself begins with the locales of
those in births of misery and proceeds to the places inhabited by those of the
higher births. Within the births of misery we treat first the hot hells, and after
that the cold.

Twenty thousand yojana deep [about 90,000 miles] beneath of us here on
Dzambu Continent lies the ceiling of the hell known as No Respite. Its height
and depth are just the same: twenty thousand yojana each. The hell is known
as "No Respite" because the beings living there experience unlimited sufferings
without the slightest interruption. Some have claimed that "No Respite" [Skt:
avi¯ci] takes its name from the fact that there is no [Skt: a] occurrence of
pleasure [Skt: vi¯] here.

Seven are the hells atop of No Respite:
1) "Revive," so called because the beings living here strike each other
with various weapons until they all lie still as death. Then a

makes them rise and start all over again.

Sixteen extra, adjacent hells come with each of the entire eight, standing
around them in a circular arrangement. At each of their four individual

quarters we find then first a hell by the name of Embers. These embers reach
up to one's knees: when he sets his foot down, all the flesh and bone of his leg
are burned away. When he raises his foot again, it all grows back.

Next is the Corpse Rot, a swamp hell of rotten corpses. You sink down to
your waist and out come creatures called Sharpbeaks, with white bodies and
black heads, to spear your body. Right up against the Swamp is the Razor-
Studded Road, where again the flesh and bone of your feet are sliced away as
you set your feet down, constantly regenerating as you raise them again.

"The rest" refers first to the Forest of Swords, where the leaves of the trees are
actually swords. A breeze blows through the forest and stirs the sword-leaves,
which fall and lacerate your body. Great speckled dogs live in the forest and
attack, tearing the flesh away with fangs of iron. Terror drives you to the
Wood of Shalmali.

The shalmali are huge trees with trunks many miles in height, covered with
spines some sixteen inches long. As you climb a tree to escape the dogs, its
spines point downwards and stick into your body. When you reach the top,
ravens with steel beaks are waiting to pluck your eyeballs away from the
sockets. In desperation you begin to climb back down, only now the spikes
turn their points upward to spear your body again.

Last comes the River Uncrossable, filled with burning ashes and almost
impossible to pass. Now the three hells of the previous paragraphs are
counted only as one because the instruments of torture in each of them are of
the same general type. The dogs and ravens are considered characteristics of
the Forest of Swords and the Shalmali Wood.

In front of these hells stand the hellguards of the Lord of Death, weapons in
hand to stop any of the hellbeings from running somewhere else. One may
ask whether these guards are a kind of living being or not. The Sutrists claim
that they are not, that they are merely constructs of the elements and their
derivatives, like mountains that resemble the head of a goat or sheep.

Some might say that this explanation seems to contradict a verse from the
venerable Dharmika Subhuti:
Those who delight in anger, cruelty,
Those who find their pleasure in bad deeds,
Those who love to see some suffering,
Take their births as demons of Lord Death.

And yet it does not. Here the expression "demons of Lord Death" is meant to
refer only to those craving spirits who act as attendants to the Lord of All
Things, the Lord of Death, and whose job it is to lead beings to their places in
the hells.

The Detailists on their part claim that the hellguards are a kind of living being,
and that after their deaths they take birth as hellbeings themselves, this being
the ripened result of their having done such harm to the beings in the hells.
They say the reason why the guards themselves are left unharmed by the
hellfires and so on is that their past deeds prevent it.

Blisters Bursting, Chattering, Moaning in Cold, Screaming in Cold, Splitting

One might ask how all these different hells, No Respite and the rest, could ever
fit under this one continent. And yet they do, for the continents are all much
wider at the base, shaped like a pile of grain.

Now the principal habitat for animals is supplied by the Great Outer Sea: their
numbers here are great, their suffering limitless. Those that live in the lands
of men and pleasure beings are spread all over, with no one particular location.
The main place for craving spirits lies beneath the area of Rajagirha here on
our continent, some five hundred yojana [about 2,250 miles] deep. Here lives
the Lord of Death, known also as the Lord of All Things. He has the body of
a craving spirit, for the past deeds that have thrown him into this place were
non-virtuous. The deeds that determined the finishing details of his life,
though, were virtuous--so he enjoys a kind of eminence, like one of the greater
pleasure beings.

His job is to inform beings who are headed for the hells, those who are
ignorant of why they must go there, just what they did to deserve such a birth.
He is attended by some thirty-six types of craving spirits. These spirits may,
in general, be divided into three different groups: those with outer obstacles,
those with inner obstacles, and those with obstacles in the very nature of what
they try to eat or drink. Such spirits who live in the lands of men or pleasure
beings have no particular place, and are found throughout these areas.

Having thus discussed places where beings in the births of misery live, we turn
to the locations of those in the higher births. Since we have already described
the places where humans live, we begin with the lands of the pleasure beings.
These fall into two types: those actually related to an area of solid ground, and
those not so related. In the first category fall the lands of those in the class of
the Four Great Kings, as well as those of the Thirty-Three. Pleasure beings in
the class of the Four Great Kings may themselves be divided into those of the
mansions, and those of the mountains.

Introduction to Eons

,BSKAL PA RNAM PA MANG BSHAD PA,
Many different types of eons are taught.
[III.358]

,DANG PO NI, BSKAL PA RNAM PA MANG DU BSHAD PA YIN TE, 'JIG PA'I BSKAL PA, 'CHAGS PA'I BSKAL PA, GNAS PA'I BSKAL PA, BSKAL PA CHEN PO RNAMS SU BSHAD PA'I PHYIR,
By way of introduction, we may say that many different types of eons are
taught. These include the eon of destruction, the eon of formation, the eon of
continuation, and the great eon.

GNYIS PA LA, 'JIG, 'CHAGS, GNAS, BSKAL PA CHEN PO'I,
Our detailed treatment of eons covers four topics, which correspond to the four
different types of eons just mentioned.

80
The Eon of Destruction

,'JIG PA'I BSKAL PA DMYAL BA YI,
,SRID PA MED NAS SNOD ZAD PA,
An eon of destruction from the point
Of no more hell births to the vessel's end.
[III.359-60]

,DANG PO NI, BSKAL PA RNAM PA MANG BSHAD PA, ZHES BSHAD NA, 'JIG PA'I BSKAL PA SOGS GANG ZHE NA, 'JIG PA'I BSKAL PA NI, MNAR MED PA'I DMYAL BA'I SRID PA SEMS CAN MED PA NAS BZUNG STE SNOD KYI 'JIG RTEN ZAD PA'I BAR YIN NO,
"In the line above," one may begin, "you mentioned that `many different types
of eons are taught.' Can you now describe the `eon of destruction' and other
kinds of eons?" An "eon of destruction" starts from the point of where there
are no more beings taking births in the hell called "No Respite." And it lasts
up to the point where that great vessel, the outer world, has come to its end.
 , DE YANG MNAR MED DU SEMS CAN SKYE 'PHRO CHAD PA DANG , 'DZAM BU GLING PA'I MI RNAMS TSE LO BRGYAD KHRI BAR 'PHEL BA DANG , GNAS PA'I 'JUG RDZOGS PA DANG , 'JIG PA'I MGO RTZOM PA RNAMS DUS MNYAM,
Four different events then occur simultaneously: (1) the discontinuation of all
births by living beings into the hell of No Respite; (2) the increase of lifespans
among humans of Dzambu Continent up to eighty thousand years in length;
(3) the close of the eon of continuation, and (4) the opening of the eon of
destruction.

At this stage all the beings living in the hell of No Respite come to the end of
their lives--they die and move on. And even those who have collected new
karma that would normally bring them a rebirth in this same hell take their
birth instead in the hell on another planet. The same process follows for the
beings in the other hells, as well as for the animals and craving spirits living
in the depths of the seas. And the same thing happens, at the same time, with
the animals and craving spirits living in the lands of pleasure beings and
humans.

At this point one of the human beings living on Dzambu Continent
automatically attains the first concentration level. When he comes back out of
it, he exclaims: "Wonders! The bliss and pleasure that come from this deep
solitude are truly happiness!" Other inhabitants of the continent hear these
words, and then attain the first concentration level which is achieved
automatically. Subsequently they all take birth at the same level.

The very same process then occurs, in respective order, with the inhabitants of
the eastern continent and those of the continent to the west--Cattle Users. The
beings who live on the northern continent of Terrible Sound though possess a
special obstruction that has ripened from their past deeds, and are completely
incapable of ridding themselves of attachment for the kind of life they have.
Thus the process for them is that they first take rebirth as pleasure beings of
the desire realm.

The six classes of desire-realm pleasure beings each then go through the same
process, one by one. One of them attains the first concentration level
automatically. When he comes out of it, he exclaims: "Wonders! The bliss and
pleasure that come from this deep solitude are truly happiness!" Again the
others hear about it, and reach themselves the first concentration level achieved
through an automatic process. This leads them to take a birth into the level
known as "Class of the Pure."

Next one of the beings residing at the first concentration level achieves the
second concentration level, again through an automatic process. He comes out
of it and exclaims, "Wonders! The bliss and pleasure that come from single-
pointed concentration are truly happiness!" Still again the others hear about
it, and reach themselves the second concentration level achieved by an
automatic process. This brings about their birth at this second level.

The events described above go on for some nineteen intermediate eons. At this
point the great pleasure beings begin to stop sending rain at its proper time;
all the vegetation and forests of Dzambu Continent dry up and die. After an
extremely long period of time, a second sun rises in the sky, creating
tremendous heat. All the lesser bodies of water and small ponds turn dry.

This leads to the rising of a third sun, which causes all the streams and rivers
to evaporate. A fourth sun rises, and even the huge Lake Neverwarm
disappears. Then comes the fifth sun, drying the Great Outer Sea as well.
With the rising of a sixth sun, the four continents and Mount Supreme dissolve
in a cloud of smoke. Finally a seventh sun comes up, engulfing the world in
a single flame, destroying it in fire.

This fire then triggers a parallel fire in the first concentration level. The
mansions of this first level, empty of inhabitants by this time, are burned
completely. It is not actually the fire in the desire realm that burns down the
mansions here, for they are separate levels.

These last events require a single intermediate eon, which means that the
destruction of the world takes a total of twenty intermediate eons. The above
description, by the way, pertains to the destruction of a world by fire. In cases
where the planet is destroyed by water, beings living at the second
concentration level attain the third level of concentration by an automatic
process. This leads to their subsequent birth at the third level. In an instance
where the world is, finally, destroyed by wind, inhabitants of this third level
reach the fourth concentration level by an automatic process and then take
birth there.

Now an eon of formation begins from the rising of the first gentle wind on
up to the birth of a single living being within the hell of No Respite. At the
very beginning, space is completely empty--then a gentle wind rises, a portent
of the formation of a new planet. The force of this wind alone would never be
enough to create that great vessel, the outer world--although the levels from
Class of the Pure down to Free of Conflict do take shape.

This same wind from before then gathers strength over a period of a great
many years, until all the parts of the world from the foundation disc of wind
up to the land of the Thirty-Three have formed, one by one, working up from
the bottom. All these different events require one entire intermediate eon.

Next there is a certain being who was living at the level of Clear Light, and
whose life, merit, and power of past deeds have all run out. He takes a rebirth
into the empty mansion of the Pure One; for it is the nature of things, that
what was destroyed last is the first to take form. Then come all the other
inhabitants of the world, one by one, up to those of Dzambu Continent.

These first human beings to dwell on Dzambu Continent are born
instantaneously, all complete. For food they need nothing but the feeling of
bliss, and their bodies shine with a radiant light. They have miraculous

powers that allow them to fly in the sky, and live for an "inestimable" number
of years. This entire process, up to the point where a single living being takes
birth into the hell of No Respite, requires some nineteen intermediate eons.

Four different events then occur simultaneously: (1) a drop in the lifespan from
a "inestimable" number to eighty thousand years; (2) the birth of any single
being into the hell of No Respite; (3) the close of the formation eon; and (4) the
opening of the eon of continuation.

Down to when the spans of life are ten;
Eighteen other eons after that,
Each an increase followed by decrease;
Last of all is one which is an increase,
Up until they're eighty thousand long.
[III.363-8]

Now the length of an eon of continuation is twenty intermediate eons, with the
length of each intermediate eon figured as follows. One such eon consists of
the period during which average lifespans drop from an "inestimable" number
of years down to when the spans of life are only ten years. There are
eighteen other intermediate eons after that, each consisting of an increase in
lifespans up to eighty thousand years followed by a decrease back to ten. Last
of all is one intermediate eon which is another increase alone. How far is the
increase? Up until they're eighty thousand long.

One may make the following objection: "According to you then, the first and
final members of any such set of twenty intermediate eons represent only half
a curve apiece--whereas each of the eighteen between consist of full curves.
Wouldn't this imply a difference in the lengths of these different eons?" It does
not, for the first and final ones move along their half curves relatively slower,
while the eons in between these two move along their full curves relatively
faster.

Thus we can say that the process of the world's formation goes on for twenty
intermediate eons. This formation of the world, then its destruction, and the
state that follows this destruction are all equal in duration: each lasts for
twenty intermediate eons.

,BZHI PA NI, BAR BSKAL BRGYAD CU LA BSKAL CHEN ZHES BYA'O,

Having thus concluded our main explanation of eons, we turn to several
incidental points. These include further information relating first to great eons,
then to eons of destruction. The former treats the occurrence of three types of
beings: Buddhas, self-made victors, and wheel emperors.

One may begin with the following question: "It is explained that Buddhas come
from the act of accumulating merit and wisdom for a period of three
`countless' eons. Just what type of eons are referred to here?" A Buddha
occurs from the act of accumulating merit and wisdom for a period of three
"countless" numbers of these great eons.

Some may object that it is a contradiction of terms to speak of "three" that are
"countless." And yet it is not. Here we are not talking about the "countless"
that refers to something that is beyond numbers. Rather, what we call a
"countless" is the name of a specific number, the highest of our numbers with
separate names, corresponding to ten to the sixtieth power.

BSKAL PA 'DI LA BSKAL PA BZANG PO SGRON ME'I BSKAL PA ZHES KYANG BYA STE, DAM CHOS PAD MA DKAR PO LAS,
Now the present eon is also known as the "Eon of Good Fortune," the "Eon of

During the formation of the world, a thousand lotus blossoms of
gold with a thousand petals each appear within the great disc of
water. They pique the curiosity of the pleasure beings of the
Pure Places, who investigate the phenomenon and come to learn
that it portends the appearance of a thousand Buddhas.
"Wonders!" they proclaim, "a thousand different Buddhas are to
come--this eon is truly an eon of good fortune!" Thus it is that
everyone calls this time the "Eon of Good Fortune."

One may ask just when it is that Buddhas like this appear. They never come
while the average lifespan is rising, for during this period beings feel less
disgust with the circle of life. Rather, they--these Buddhas--make their
appearance during the time that starts from the drop of lifespans from eighty
thousand years, and which continues as they go down, until a hundred years
is reached.

DE MAN CHAD DU MI 'BYUNG STE, SNYIGS MA LNGA HA CANG YANG BDO BA SHAS CHE BAS CHOS BSTAN PA'I SNOD DU MI RUNG BA'I PHYIR,
Buddhas do not appear subsequent to this period, as lifespans are decreasing
even further. Since the five degenerations have spread fairly widely by this
time, beings then are no fit vessels to receive the teachings.

The Asian Classics Institute
Course VIII: Death and the Realms of Existence
Reading Nine: The Meditation on Death, Part One
The following selection is taken from the Great Book on the Steps of the Path
(Lamrim Chenmo), by Je Tsongkapa (1357-1419).

The second part, the instruction on how to get the very essence out of life,
includes three different sections: the teaching on how to train one's mind in the
steps of the path that are shared with those of lesser scope; the teaching on
how to train one's mind in the steps of the path that are shared with those of
medium scope; and the teaching on how to train one's mind in the steps of the
path for those of greater scope.

The first of these three sections has three divisions of its own: the actual
teaching for training one's mind in the attitude of a person of lesser scope; how
to know when you have succeeded in reaching this attitude; and clearing up
some misconceptions about the attitude. The first of these divisions has two
parts: learning to develop the attitude of focussing on the life hereafter; and
learning to make use of the various ways of achieving happiness in these
future lives.

We will cover the subject of focusing on the life after death in two stages. The
first is the contemplation of how to maintain an awareness of death; that is, the
fact that we have not long to stay in this present world. The second is the
contemplation of the relative happiness and pain of the two broad categories
of living beings; that is, the question of what will happen to us when we reach
our future life.

There are four steps to the contemplation of death. These are:
1) Considering the problems of not meditating on death.
2) Considering the benefits of meditating on death.
3) Identifying just what kind of death awareness we seek to develop.
4) How to meditate and develop this awareness of death.

Here is the first of the four. Above we spoke of getting the very essence out
of this life, where now you have a whole range spiritual opportunities. The
one thing that could damage your ability to do so, from the very beginning, is
the first of what we call the "four misconceptions." This is the misconception
where you grasp to impermanent things as being permanent.

There are two versions to this wrong idea. One is more subtle, and one is
more gross. The one that could damage your practice is the grosser one, where
you look upon your own impermanence, your own mortality, and imagine for
some reason that you are not going to die.
Now it is true that in your life up to now you have had some awareness that
eventually you would have to die. Everybody has this kind of death
awareness. But at the same time you tend to be of the opinion that you won't
die, because with every day that passes you say to yourself, "It won't be today,
today is not the day that I will die." And you keep this attitude all the way up
to the moment of your death.

Suppose you let this kind of attitude go on, suppose you fail to apply the
spiritual antidotes that would stop these sorts of thoughts. The thoughts then
create a kind of spiritual blindness: you begin to get the idea that you are
going to be able to stay here in this life, and then you start to obsess on this
life. All you can concentrate on then is how to get what you want, and how
to escape what you don't want, in this life. Your life becomes, "Today I need
this, and this, and next this."

And then even if--by some remote chance--you do engage in spiritual
activities like learning, or contemplation, or meditation, they all become
something you are doing only for this life. Whatever good deeds you do this
way are of very little strength. And because they are then typically connected
with some bad deed, some breaking of morality or transgression of a vow, it
is quite unusual to find any good activities of this type that are not interlaced
with the very causes that would take you to one of the births of misery.

Suppose even that you do decide to do something for your future life.
Without this awareness of death you find yourself unable to stop the kind of
laziness where you put your practice off, where you say to yourself, "I'll get to
it later, I'll do all these things eventually, one at a time." You begin to pass the
time of your life with all kinds of distractions: with sleep, or lazing around, or
wasted talk, or food or drink, or the like. You won't be able to reach a point
where the practice that you do has any great energy behind it.

This kind of hope that you will be able to live for a long time deceives you.
You start to have strong attachment to gain, to being honored by other people,
and the like. You begin to feel a strong dislike for anything that prevents you,
or anything that you think might prevent you, from having these things. There
grows in you a dark ignorance that cannot understand the problems these
thoughts then give you.

These lead to a steady torrent of mental afflictions, strong ones, and all the
different varieties of them, major and minor: pride, and jealousy, and all the
rest.

These afflictions in turn lead you to harmful deeds done in your acts, your
words, and your thoughts: deeds like the ten non-virtues, and the five
"immediate" deeds, and the five that are close to these, and giving up the
highest Dharma, and on and on. Every single day then deeds like these, of
tremendous power, capable of leading you to the sufferings of the three lower
realms and the like, will tend to increase, further and further.
The antidote for all these deeds is the nectar of the Dharma, spoken so true,
and the further you turn from it then the more tightly you strangle your
chances for the higher realms, and ultimate good. Death will rip away your
life, and the wrong deeds you have done will drag you to the lower realms, to
a fearful place of mighty and savage suffering, to the fires. And so I ask you,
where could you find any thought more disastrous for you than this idea, that
what is impermanent could be permanent?

On this point the Four Hundred concurs:
What could be more a disaster than someone
Who with no other Lord of Death to kill him
Was acting as this Lord of Three Realms
For himself, asleep as if all were well?
[The "Lord of the Three Realms" is the Lord of Death; he has total control over
all living things except those who are travelling on the path of the realized,
those who have seen emptiness directly. If we could reach this path we would
have a chance to reach deathlessness, but instead we lazily act as if everything
were all right, and end up inviting Lord Death, who otherwise would have to
pass us by.]

The Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life says as well,
You must leave it all behind and go, with your karmic baggage,
But because you do not understand this,
You undertake an entire variety of wrong deeds,
Reacting to your friends, and your enemies.

Here secondly is the contemplation of the benefits of meditating upon your
death. Suppose on the other hand that you are able to develop a real
awareness of your mortality. You would then be like a person who knew he
or she were going to die within the next day or two.

If this person had even a feeble understanding of the Dharma, or of course
anything more than that, then he or she would quickly realize that none of
their loved ones, nor any of the things they owned or anything else, could go
on the journey with them. All their attachment to these things would stop.
The great majority of such people at this point would automatically start to feel
some desire to get the essence out of the life they had left to them, and they
would start to engage in acts such as charity and the like.

You now should be the same. Think of the gain and honor, the fame and other
such things you hope for from others--all these worldly hopes and dreams.
Try to see that all the efforts you put into these things are empty, meaningless,
like useless shells of wheat once the grain has been taken out. Try to
understand how these thoughts deceive you, how they wait to snare and trap
you. Stop all your bad deeds.
Exert yourself now in the opposite--in good deeds, such as going for refuge,
and observing an ethical way of life, and the like. Amass these kinds of deeds
constantly, and with a sense of reverence and joy. This body and the rest may
be meaningless, but you can give them the highest meaning; you can use them
to climb to the highest state there is, and then you can lead others there as
well. And then I would ask you another question: Where could you find any
more important deed you could do, than this?

This is why the awareness of death is praised in so many places, with so many
metaphors. We see for example the following, from the Sutra of the Great
Nirvana:
Of all the crops plowed in the ground,
the crops of autumn are greatest.
Of all the tracks left on the ground,
the elephant's are greatest.
Of all the thoughts a person can have,
the thoughts of impermanence
and death are the greatest ones,
For these are the thoughts that clear away
the desire, ignorance, and the pride
of all three of the realms.

The awareness of death has been praised in other similes as well, sometimes
for example compared to a great hammer, which can smash in a single stroke
all your mental afflictions, and harmful deeds. It is also compared to a huge
gateway, where all good and pure things can come through to you, all in a
single rush.

The Anthology too states,

Come to see that this body of yours
is fragile as a piece of china,
And that all other things that exist
are something similar to a mirage.
If you can, then the rain of spears
thrown by the demons, the flowers,
Are stopped short, and the Lord of Death
hungering for you dies himself.

It says as well that,
Those who have seen what it is to grow old,
who have seen the suffering of disease,
Those who have seen what it is to die,
who have seen the mind depart and leave,
They can give up the family life,
so much like a prison hard and fast;
Don't ever dream though that normal people
of the world could ever give up desire.

To put it briefly, the time for a person to do something of value is now, and
only now--now while we possess a body and life like this, so full of spiritual
leisure. You and I have spent most of our time in the births of misery, and we
come up now and again to the better births; but the vast majority of the time
was in the realms where we had none of the necessary opportunities, and so
we had no chance at all to undertake any spiritual practice.
And the fact that in this moment here, when we have found the kind of life
where we could do some practice, we nonetheless do nothing the way it
should be done, is all in the final analysis due to our belief that we will not
die, just yet. We can say then that our natural bias towards thinking that we
won't die is the root of every trouble we have. The antidote for this way of
thinking--that is, to stay aware of our imminent death--is then the root of
anything good that could ever come to us.

This being the case, you should never let yourself think, "This is one of those
practices meant for people who have nothing more profound to meditate
upon." And you should never let yourself think that, "It is admittedly
something we should meditate upon, but only at the beginning of our practice,
and only for a bit at that; it's not something that warrants a continual effort to
put into practice." Rather you should try to develop a true understanding,
from the depths of your heart, where you realize that this is a meditation
which you need at the start, at the end, and all throughout the path. With this
understanding established within you then, you must meditate upon your
death.

Here now is the third step--identifying just what kind of death awareness we
seek to develop. Now there is a kind of terror that a person can feel when he
or she fears that they are about to be torn away from their loved ones and
such. This fear stems from a very strong attachment for those around you, and
is the natural fear of a person who has never attempted any kind of practice
of the path. As such, it is not the awareness of death that we are talking about
having to develop here.

What then is this awareness? There is not a single being who has taken on a
body like ours--one created by the force of our past deeds and mental
afflictions--who is exempt from the absolute certainty of death. It is true that,
in the short run, trying to develop some fear about this fact might not enable
you to stop it. Nonetheless you really must try to develop some fear that you
might die before you have been able to achieve your goals for your future life:
that you might die before you have managed to put an end to anything that
might cause you to be born in one of the lower realms, or before you have
achieved all those things that would lead you to the higher realms, and to
ultimate good.

If you had this kind of fear, over these kinds of things, then it would help you
to do something about them, and at the moment of death itself you would
have no reason to be afraid. If on the other hand you find yourself unable to
achieve these goals, then when death comes you will be tormented by regret,
of two different kinds. In a general sense, you will realize that you were
unable to free yourself from the circle of suffering life. More specifically, you
will begin to feel sheer terror over the possibility of having to drop into the
realms of misery. As the Birth Stories say,
You concentrate your every effort,
but there's no way to stay;
What possible benefit can it be
to feel a sense of fear
And tremble over something that
you can now never repair?
You can tell yourself by looking at
the nature of this world,
That those who did bad deeds are at
this point consumed by regret;
They realize then that they didn't at all
do good the way they should,
And begin to suspect that in the life
beyond they will come to suffer.
The fear that you begin to feel
as you die confuses you,
Making it difficult to recall
the very deeds there were
That you did before, and that you feel
such strong regret for doing.
So make it now a habit in your life
to undertake those deeds that are pure white;
For where would you ever find a person who,
living the Dharma, still needs fear Lord Death?

The Four Hundred too has the following verse:
Anyone who's truly sure,
Who says to themselves, "I'll die,"
Leaves every kind of fear behind;
How could they then fear Death?

Suppose then that you are able to contemplate your impermanence, and think
to yourself, over and over again, "There is absolutely no doubt that I am
quickly going to be ripped away from my body, and from all of my
possessions." This would allow you to block the kind of desire that still
entertains some hope that you will be able to avoid losing all these things.
And then you would feel none of the fear of death that comes when your mind
is tormented by the thought of this loss.

Next we cover the fourth step, which is how to meditate and develop this
awareness of death. You should do the meditation in three stages, going
through the three principles, the nine reasons, and the three resolutions. We
will proceed then through the three of (a) contemplating how it is certain that

we will die; (b) contemplating how there is no certainty when we will die; and
(c) contemplating how, when we do die, nothing but the Dharma can be of any
help to us.

The first of these has three parts; here is the first, which is (1) contemplating
how the Lord of Death must certainly arrive and, when he does, how nothing
at all can stop him.
No matter what kind of body you take on yourself, death must come to you.
As the Anthology on Impermanence states,
If total Buddhas, and self-made Buddhas as well,
And the listeners who are the followers of the Buddha,
All must eventually leave their holy forms,
Why should we need then speak of normal people?

We can say too that death will come to you, no matter where you go. The
same text says,
It doesn't matter where you go; the place does not exist
Where death would find it difficult to intrude.
There is no such place in the sky, nor at the bottom
Of the sea, nor deep within a mountain keep.

So too death makes no distinction at all for the proper order of young and old
when it comes to destroy its victims. On this the same work says,
Those who are now, and those who are yet to be,
All must give up this body, and travel on.
Realize, you wise ones, that all this dies;
Live the Dharma, and do what must be done.

Beyond this is the fact that no one can free themselves from the Lord of Death
by outrunning him, nor turn him back with magic words or the like. As the
scripture known as Advice to the King states,
Suppose for example that you were surrounded on all four sides
by four great mountains, solid, firm, hard to the core,
indestructible, unbreakable, indomitable, adamantine and
massive, stretching to the highest limits of the sky. And then
suppose suddenly that they caved in on you. Every trace of
vegetation--from the roots, to the stalks, to the branches, to the
twigs, and out to the leaves, would be crushed to powder. And

every living creature there, every sentient being, every spirit too,
would be smashed to dust. And as the mountains fell in it
would happen in a minute, and no one would be able to outrun
them, or force them back, or buy them off. Nor but with the
greatest difficulty could you use any kind of magic substance, or
magic words, or any sort of elixir to stop them.

Here, great King, our life is the same. When the four great
terrors make their appearance, no one can outrun them, nor force
them back, nor buy them off. Nor but with the greatest difficulty
could you use any kind of magic substance, or magic words, or
any sort of elixir to stop them.

And what are these four terrors? They are aging, and sickness,
and death, and trouble. Great King, I say to you: aging is the
fact that our vitality is inevitably obliterated; sickness is the fact
that our health is inevitably obliterated; trouble is the fact that
any good thing that ever comes to us is inevitably obliterated;
and death is the fact that our very life is inevitably obliterated.
All four of these come to us, and we cannot outrun them, nor
force them back, nor buy them off. Nor but with the greatest
difficulty could you use any kind of magic substance, or magic
words, or any sort of elixir to stop them.

Kamawa too once said,
A person is supposed to be frightened of death now, and then
unperturbed when it actually comes. You and me though act the
opposite: we feel no concern for it now, and then when it
actually comes we will tear at our chest in agony.

The second reason here is (2) the contemplation of how it is impossible to add
any time onto your life, and how it continually leaks away, without a pause.
The scripture entitled Entering the Womb describes the longest you could live
as follows:
Nowadays the longest you can live, supposing you are able to
take care of yourself in the very best way possible, is a hundred
years, or a touch more.

Even if you could live for a hundred years, the time would pass very quickly.
This is because years pass in months, and months in their turn pass in days,
and days pass in daytimes and nighttimes. These too pass in the shortest

periods, of mornings and evenings and the like. So a human lifespan in
general is something which is very short.

You and I can see for ourselves, moreover, that we've already used up a good
number of these days. As for the days we have left, we know we are helpless
to add a single moment to them. They leak away, twenty-four hours a day,
without the slightest pause. On this the Guide to the Bodhisattva's Life says,
Our lifetime constantly leaks away,
Day and night, without a moment's pause.
If your life is leaking away, and never being replenished,
Then how can you imagine, that you will never die?

There are many examples you can use during your contemplation of these
points. Think of weaving a carpet: you are building it up with rows of yarn,
and each row is nothing more than a few threads of wool. But if you work
steadily, it all adds up and soon you've finished an entire carpet.
Think too of a flock of sheep. When they are led to the slaughter house, they
go forth with only one very short step at a time. But every single step brings
them inexorably nearer to their death.

Think too of the rapids of a great river, or of a waterfall as it leaps from the
top of a high cliff. The moments of your life are rushing away, just the same.

A cowherd takes a club up in his hand and drives the cattle, totally helpless,
to their destination. Just so do sickness and the natural aging of our bodies
drive us, totally helpless, into the presence of the Lord of Death. You must use
a whole variety of such examples in your meditation upon death; as the
Anthology again says,
When for example you start to weave a carpet,
You build it up, a string of wool at a time--
Eventually then you weave it to the end.
Human lives are just the same.
Those condemned to death are another example,
Passing along with a single step at a time,
Drawing ever closer to the slaughter.
Human lives are just the same.

The rapids of a mighty river
Rush unstoppable to their end;
The passing of a human life
Is just as irreversible.
Our lives are simple hardship, short,
And something full of suffering;
In simple speed we are all destroyed,
Letters written with a stick on water.
A cowherd for example grasps a staff,
Then drives the cattle to their destination.
Just so sickness and the ravages of age
Transport us to the presence of Lord Death.

They say as well that the great Lord Atisha would go to the edge of a stream
and meditate there on the death; he would comment that "Sitting here and
watching a trickle of water pass by is a wonderful way to meditate on life's
impermanence." The Sutra of the Cosmic Play uses a lot of similes as well:
The three realms are impermanent,
like a cloud in the autumn sky;
Watching as people are born and die
is the same as theater.
The passing of a person's life
is a single flash of lightning;
We rush on our way to the end with speed,
like a waterfall off a cliff.

It has been said that, "For a person who has the least bit of ability to reflect
and draw some inferences on the inside, there is nothing outside of them that
doesn't speak of impermanence." As such, you should try to find in your life
a whole variety of examples for the fact of impermanence. Use these examples
for your contemplation--and when you have contemplated thus on a regular
basis, you will gain a true recognition of your impermanence. Just thinking
these things over once or twice is not enough to reach this recognition. As
Kamawa once said,
Here's a question for all you people who say you tried to do this
contemplation but didn't get any result from it. Just when was it
that you were contemplating? All day long you were distracted
by other things. At night all you did was sleep. Perhaps you
should stop lying to yourself.

At the end of our life, the Lord of Death comes and destroys us, and we travel
on to our next life. But there is something else too that happens all during the
interim, during every hour of our life here. There is not a single moment at
all when our lifetime is not slipping away, when it is not getting shorter and
shorter, even as we go somewhere, or stay somewhere, waking or sleeping.
So in a sense we are always on our way to our next life, we are travelling there
now, and we have been on the move every second from the day we first
entered our mother's womb.
Therefore even in these days, while we still live, we are living only to die:
those emissaries of death, the ones called Sickness and Aging, are dragging us
towards him. Don't take any comfort then in the fact that you haven't died
yet, don't get the idea that you are staying anywhere, and that you haven't yet
started off on your journey to the next life. You are like a man who just fell
off the edge of a great rock crag; you would be foolish to take some comfort
from the fact that you are still in mid-air, and haven't hit ground yet.

The following lines too are quoted in the commentary on The Four Hundred:
This warrior amongst men, from the very first night,
From the moment of entering the womb in this world

Into the presence of the Lord of Death.

The Words on Stopping the Four Misconceptions also speak to this point:

Suppose you had fallen from the peak
of some high mountain top,
And were just about to die--would you then
in the free-fall feel content?
From the moment of their birth they race
to one goal only, death;
How before they reach there then
could any living being relax?
All of the above is meant to show how it is certain that we will die quickly.

Next is contemplating (3) how certain it is that you will die without having
had any time to practice the Dharma, even while you were alive. Suppose you
were able to live to the end of one of those longest lives that we described
above. Even so it would be wrong to think that you would have any free time
all that time. So far in your life you have squandered a great deal of time
meaninglessly; as for what remains, you will pass half of it in sleeping.

The other half you will also spend meaninglessly, your mind filled with a great
many other distractions. You will while away your days of good health and
then arrive at old age, your body and mind worn out, and lacking any energy
to do any Dharma, even if you wanted to. The point is that the window of
opportunity during which we can undertake our spiritual practice is nothing
more than a very brief period. As Entering the Womb relates,
You spend half of it wrapped in sleep. Ten years is wasted by
childhood, and another twenty in old age. From what's left you
have to subtract the time you spend in grief, and the time you
spend crying in anguish, and the time you spend in physical
pain, and the time you spend in deep unhappiness, and the time
you spend in strife. Subtract too the time that you spend going
through all those thousands of different diseases which the body
is subject to.

The Words on Stopping the Four Misconceptions concur:
Suppose you live to a human's longest life;
it can never be more than a hundred years.
Of these you spend the beginning, your youth,
and the end, old age, in a meaningless way.
In the days that are left, all your hopes and plans
are smashed by sleep, and disease, and the rest;
Tell me then how much time is left over, for those
who live as humans, to feel any kind of contentment?
Chekawa too has said,
I have been alive for sixty years; and if you take away the time
that I spent feeding myself, and sleeping, and being sick, there
were not even five years left that I had for spiritual practice.

And so all the good things of this life are like the happiness within one night's
dream: you wake, and then it's nothing more than a memory. The time comes
to die, and everything good you ever had lives only in a dim remembrance.
This great enemy, death, will surely come; nothing can stop him. You should
contemplate this fact--try to wonder, "Why do I take such pleasure in the lie
of this life?" Make up your mind that you absolutely must now practice some
Dharma; swear it to yourself, continually. Remember the Birth Stories, where
it says:
Alas, you worldly ones so full of affliction of the mind;
Why do you take such pleasure in a land of shifting sands?
The shining glory of the kumuda bloom, opening to the moon,
Soon enough turns nothing more than a simple memory.
It's something of a pure amazement too that all of us
Thrust into a life like this are not consumed by total fear;
Damn the Lord of Death, who stands and blocks all pathways out,
While we oblivious feel content, and have an enjoyable day.

We all share enemies, dreadfully powerful, ones we cannot stop:
Their names are sickness, age, and death; they attack us even now.
If it's certain that we are headed for agony in the world beyond,
How could anyone with a mind be content in the one here now?

Go now and contemplate these lines, from the Epistle of Kanika:
The Lord of Death, the heartless one,
Lays waste to the efforts of a lifetime;
With such a death on its way to him,
What man of wisdom would sit and wait?
This merciless warrior stands and aims
His detestable merciless arrow at you;
In the time before he lets it fly then
Try to make something of your life.

Here next is the second of the three principles: contemplating how there is no
certainty when we will die. It is an absolute certainty that death will come to
us at some point between today and a hundred years from now. It is not
certain though which day between these two he will choose. As such, we
would have to admit that it's impossible to come to a definite conclusion
whether or not we will die, for example, today itself.
Nonetheless, if you are going to try to think more on the mortal side, then you
will have to develop the attitude that you will die today. If you tend to think
more on the side that denies your mortality--that is, if you tend to think that
you won't die today, or that you probably won't die today--then you will
constantly be acting on the assumption that you will continue to be here, rather
than doing something to help your future life. Right in the middle of

everything then the Lord of Death will come to take you, and you will have
to die in anguish.

If you spend every day getting ready to die, you will find yourself able to
achieve many goals that relate to your future lives. This is an excellent thing
to do regardless of whether you actually die that day or not. And it is an
absolute necessity if you do happen to die that very day.
This truth can be illustrated with the following example. Suppose you have
a sworn enemy, a very powerful one, and that he is planning to make some
vicious attack on you. Suppose too that the general timeframe for this attack
has been decided: you know that he is going to come for you sometime
between this date and that date. You're not sure exactly which day he's going
to appear, but you would certainly have to be on your guard every single day.
The case with our death is exactly the same.

,ZHAG RE RE NAS DE RING 'CHI SNYAM PA'AM THA NA DE RING PHAL CHER 'CHI SNYAM PA BYUNG NA GANG DU 'GRO BA'I 'JIG RTEN PHYI MA'I DON BYED CING 'JIG RTEN 'DI'I SDOD GRABS MI BYED LA, BSAM PA DE MA BYUNG NA 'JIG RTEN 'DIR SDOD PAR MTHONG NAS DE'I GRABS BYED KYI, 'JIG RTEN PHYI MA'I DON MI BYED DE, DPER NA, GNAS GCIG TU YUN RING DU BSDAD SNYAM NA DE'I SDOD GRABS BYED PA DANG , DER MI SDOD PAR GZHAN DU 'GRO SNYAM NA GANG DU 'GRO BA'I GRABS BYED PA BZHIN NO, , DES NA NYI MA RE RE NAS 'CHI SNYAM PA'I BLO BSKYED DGOS SO,
Suppose you are able to develop this attitude where you believe that you are
going to die today, or at least that it is very likely that you will die today. The
result is that you will start getting things ready for what is surely going to
come--that is, for your next life--and you will stop concentrating on arranging
things in your current life.
If you are unable to develop this attitude, then you will continue to believe
somehow that you are going to be staying here in the present life, and you will
continue to concentrate on organizing things for this life. You will continue
too to ignore what's needed for your future life.
If for example you believe that you are going to be living in a certain house for
a long time to come, you concentrate your time on making the house a nice
place to live. If one the other hand you believe that you are moving to another
house, if you believe that you will not be staying in the house where you are,
then you naturally begin to concentrate on getting everything ready for the
place you're going to go. Again, our case is just the same.
This proves that you must develop the attitude that you are going to die today,
every day.

There are three reasons to prove this second principle, that there is absolutely
no certainty when you are going to die. The first is the contemplation that (4)
here on the continent of Dzambu, lifetimes are anything but fixed. Looking at
things in a broad way, we can say that the length of a life on the continent of
Unpleasant Sound is something which is fixed. And although on the other
continents the span of life is not fixed, there are many cases where a certain
length of life is normally the case.
Here on the continent of Dzambu though a person's life is anything but fixed.
There are times at the beginning of the world when people can live up to an

"inestimable" number of years. Eventually though there comes a time when
the the longest life we can point to is only ten years. Even nowadays we can
see with our own eyes how indefinite lifetimes can be, as death comes for the
old, and the young, and those inbetween, at random.

As the Treasure House says,
Here indefinite: at the very end,
Ten years; at the beginning "inestimable."
The Anthology too states,
In the morning a lot of people were standing here;
By evening some of them were missing.
In the evening a lot of people were standing here;
By morning some of them were missing.

So too it says,
We see men die, we see women die,
We see those in the bloom of health die;
So how on earth could you point to someone
And say, "He's young, he'll certainly live."
Some people die still in the womb,
Some people die in the moment of birth,
Some people die standing still,
Some people die on the run.
Some are old, some are young,
Some are strong ones in between,
They walk and then drop, in a steady stream,
Like ripe fruit falling from a tree.
Think of great lamas you've known, or friends, or anyone--the people that
you've seen yourself, or heard about from others--who died before their time.
Something on the outside, or something on the inside of them, came and killed
them suddenly, before they were able to do all the things they were hoping to
do.
You must think to yourself, "I'm in exactly the same situation now that they
were in when they died..." Try to think this truth over again and again; try
your best to reach this realization of your death.

Next is the contemplation that (5) the things that can kill you are very, very
many; whereas the things that can keep you alive are very few. There are
many things that threaten the kind of life we live: threats that are living beings,
and threats that are inanimate objects. Humans and inhumans, beings of the

spirit realm, do harm to us in many different ways. Beings of the animal realm
threaten our body and life in a variety of ways as well.
You have to try to contemplate thoroughly all the ways in which these living
things can hurt you; and how too that inner things like sickness, and outer
things made of the various physical elements, attack you constantly.

Moreover, your body consists by necessity of the four elements. Their nature
is to be in conflict with each other, which causes the energies of the four to fall
out of balance, some asserting themselves too strongly, and some becoming too
weak. This situation triggers then illness within the body, and this eventually
rips out your life. And so in a way you are under attack by the components
of your own body. Since these elements are a very part of you, life is by
nature a very fragile thing.

The Sutra of the Great Nirvana says as well,
And then there is the conception of death: see your life as
standing there, surrounded all the time by a mass of hate-filled
enemies, life leaking away with every moment, and no hope at
all of ever filling back what was lost.

The String of Jewels also states,
The tools of Lord Death are the very world around us;
Our lives are candles standing in a tempest.
The Letter to a Friend mentions,
Our lives are filled with danger, and we are more fragile
Than a bubble of water swept along in the wind.
The fact that we live long enough to exhale after inhaling,
Or wake again from a night of sleep, is truly a miracle.

The Four Hundred again says,
Alone they have no power to give us birth;
Only as a group can the elements in us work.
It would be totally wrong for a person to say
That this inner war could ever feel good.

These are the days when the five degenerations have spread to a very great
extent, when it is infinitely difficult to find anyone who is capable of amassing
the powerful good karma necessary for producing any very long lifetime.
Food and other kinds of medicinal substances have little potency, and lack any
great power to stop diseases.
The general ability of the body to break down easily the things we eat and
drink, so that the great elements within the body can be properly nourished,
is declining. We find it difficult to digest these things, and even after they are
digested they have little beneficial effect on our bodies.
There is an additional problem caused by the fact that we are able to collect
only small quantities of good karmic energy, whereas we commit massive
amounts of bad deeds. These diminish greatly the power of practices such as
repeating a number of mantras, and so it is extremely difficult to use these
methods to lengthen our lifespan, and such.

Beyond all this is the fact that there is nothing at all that we use to keep
ourselves alive that cannot also turn into something that kills us. We spend
our lives searching for food and drink, or a place to stay, or friends or the like,
with the intent that they help keep us from dying.
But they can all turn into something that kills us instead. If we eat or drink
too much, or too little, or ingest something which is not clean or the like, it can
kill us. Our house can collapse on us, and our friends can cheat us, and they
can all in the end lead us to our deaths. You literally cannot find anything that
is supposed to keep you alive that cannot kill you as well.

Moreover, life itself is directed at dying; even if there were more objects that
were supposed to function to keep us alive, we could hardly put any faith in
them. As the String of Jewels says,
The things that can kill us are many;
Those that keep us alive are precious few,
And act as well to kill us.
We must as such do all the Dharma we can.

Next is the contemplation that there is no certainty when we will die, for the
reason that (6) our bodies are extremely fragile. Our bodies really are very
fragile, very much like a bubble, and it requires no great injury to destroy our
life-force: even something like the prick of a thorn, if we disregard it, can kill
us. The point is that none of the things that can kill us has to try very hard to
kill us. The Letter to a Friend says,
Great edifices like the earth itself, and the mountain
At the center of the world, and the seas, all burn
When the seven suns rise, and not even dust remains.
Who needs to mention then that fragile thing called man?

Once you have taken this contemplation to its end, it will occur to you clearly
that there is no certainty at all when the Lord of Death will decide to come and
destroy your body and life. You will realize that you have no time left; and
then you must make many solemn vows to yourself, you must resolve to
practice the Dharma here and now. As the Epistle of Kanika states,
The Lord of Death is partial to no one;
When he strikes, he does so suddenly.
Don't ever say then you'll "Do it tomorrow";
Practice the Dharma instead with speed.
It's no good thing for a human being
Ever to say, "I'll do it tomorrow";
The tomorrow when you are no longer here
Is a day that beyond any doubt will come.

That lord of accomplished practitioners, Shri Jagata Mitra Ananda, has also
spoken:
The spirit lord will take this form you rent,
In health, in its prime, in an hour of contentment,
And rip away in this very moment its heart.
You sit there now unconcerned by disease or death,
By decline and the like, but when the day arrives
To meet them face to face you'll know nothing to do.
Of all the three principles, this one, the contemplation that it is totally
uncertain when you will die, is the most important. Since this attitude is the
critical one, you must do your best to grow it within you.

Here finally are the three reasons behind the third principle, which is
that--when you do die--nothing but the Dharma can be of the least help to
you.
So we have seen that we will be forced to pass on to a future life. When the
day comes, you can be surrounded by any number of friends and relatives, by
people who love you and whose hearts are torn, but (7) there is not a single
one of them that you can take along with you. You can be the owner of a
great heap of lovely riches, any amount of them at all, but (8) you cannot carry
along with you a single molecule. When you die (9) you must give up even
the flesh and bone that are part of your very being; it's ridiculous to think then
that you could keep anything else.

We can say then that each and every good thing of this life will send us away,
and we too will send them away, and pass on to our next life: this is, simply,
quite certain to happen. You must contemplate how this is coming to you
today, and you must contemplate how, when the moment comes, it is only the
Dharma which will be your refuge, and your protector, and your one true
friend. As the Epistle of Kanika says,
The karma ripens, and all your deeds
From before abandon and leave you alone.
Driven by all the new karma now,
You're forced ahead by the Lord of Death.
Everyone you've ever known
Is left behind, and only the good
Or bad you've done comes with you.
Please understand, and do only things that are right.

GSUNGS PA LTAR RO,
It's just as Shri Jagata Mitra describes it:
Now matter how wealthy you are, Your Highness,
Once you die and slip to the world beyond,
It's like standing defeated in an empty desert--
Alone, without the Prince, without the Queen,
Without a stitch of clothing, without a friend,
Without a kingdom, without a country at all;
Solitary, single, not a trusted servant in sight.
To put it simply, how could you hope for more
In a land where you no longer own your own name?

Thus it is then that you must contemplate upon the awareness of your death:
the spiritual leisure you now possess is extremely valuable; it is extremely
difficult to find; and beyond its being so hard to find it is also extremely easy
to lose.
Suppose we fail even to attempt reaching something of ultimate benefit, for our
next life and beyond; suppose instead we spend all the time from now up to
the moment of our death in the pursuit of the things that make us feel good,
and in avoiding the things that cause us pain.

Common animals are more skilled at this endeavor than we could ever be; we
need to engage in some kind of activity that distinguishes us from beasts.
Otherwise achieving the kind of life in a higher birth that we enjoy now is
essentially the same as never having found it at all. As the Guide to the
Bodhisattva's Life puts it,
There are certain insignificant gains
That are not a difficult thing to attain
Even for a cow if he tries;
Yet there are those who suffer from karma
And waste this perfect leisure and fortune,
Achieved with such effort, on nothing more.

And so even though the awareness of your death may sometimes seem a
difficult thing to attain, you must still make great efforts to do so, for it is the
very foundation of the path. Potowa too has said,
My guiding lamp is nothing but this meditation on my own
impermanence. It helps me to clear away all my concern about
the things of this life--my friends and possessions and so
on--and realize that I will be flying away to my next life, alone,
with no one to come along with me. Then I am truly able to stop
my attachment to my current life, and maintain an intention
never to do anything which is against the Dharma. As long as
you find yourself unable to reach this state of mind, you will find
too that the road to each and every part of the teaching is shut
off to you.

Dolpa once stated,
You must along the way undertake practices to amass the energy
of good deeds, and to purify yourself of spiritual obstacles. So
too you must make supplication to the angels, and to your Lama.
If then you put all your heart into contemplating this attitude, if
you focus on it, you will be able to attain it. Things produced by
causes have a basic nature that they can never just stay the same,
and you will find that you can arrive at certain kinds of attitudes
that you thought you could never develop in a thousand years of
trying.

They say too that when someone would ask Kamawa if they could move on
to a new spiritual topic he would say, "Work again on the old one." When
they asked if he could finish up the old one, he would say, "There is no finish
to the old one." So if your mind can handle it, do the meditation as I have
described it above. If your mind cannot handle it, then try to absorb as many
of the nine reasons for the three principles as fits your capacity.

Meditate over and over on your death until you gain a complete disgust for
the activities of this life; until you can think of them like a man on his way to
the site of his execution, stopping to put on some fine jewelry.
The subjects of how to serve a spiritual guide, of the spiritual fortune and
leisure of this life, and of our impermanence are found throughout the
supreme form of speech, the word of the Buddha, and the commentaries upon
it. You must come to realize that these are instructions to be put into practice
at each point where they occur, and so you should actually undertake them at
each step.
If you do so, then you will be able to grasp the true intent of the victorious
Buddhas quite easily. You should apply this advice to each of the other
sections here as well.

This brings us to our second major division, which is the contemplation of
what will happen to us in our next life. This involves thinking about the
relative happiness and suffering of the higher and lower realms.
