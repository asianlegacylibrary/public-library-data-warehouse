MTSUNG MED LCANG SKYA ROL PA'I RDO RJE'I GSUNG LCANG SKYA GRUB MTHA' NAS,
The first selection is from the Schools of Philosophy, written by Changkya Rolpay
Dorje (1717-1786).

Here next are the Buddhist schools. They are the Detailists, the Sutrists, the
Mind-Only School, and those of the Middle Way. The number of these schools
is exactly four, no more or less, and this is proven by numerous statements
from both the secret and the open scriptures. In particular, in proof of this
number there is the following quotation from the Commentary by Diamond
Heart:
Those of the Buddha are four; the Able One
Had no intention of a fifth.
Master Aryadeva has said as well:

Those who assert that the teachings of the Buddha
Consist of four schools have seen the way it is:
These, for those who hope to practice, are precisely
The paths explained by the Detailists and the rest.

On the question of an evolution of these four schools, some people assert that
the Detailist and Sutrist Schools started after the third council for assembling
the scriptures. They say that the Middle-Way School began during the days
of Master Nagarjuna, and that the Mind-Only started in the time of Arya
Asanga. They also believe that, prior to these points in time, there was no
concept of the four schools.
This idea is however incorrect, for we do see the concept of the four schools
in works such as Ocean of the Angels; the Secret Teaching of Lo Diamond, in Two
Parts; the Secret Teaching of the Wheel of Time; the Secret Teaching of Diamond
Arali; and others as well.

Now the Treasure House of Knowledge utilizes eight chapters as a means of
expressing its subject matter of five basic types. Our explanation of the work
has four divisions: an explanation of its title, the translator's obeisance, an
explanation of the body of the text, and an explanation of the conclusion. In
explaining the title we will first translate it, then elucidate its meaning.

About the Title

*, RGYA GAR SKAD DU, AA BHI DHARMA KO shA K'A RI K'A,
BOD SKAD DU, CHOS MNGON PA'I MDZOD KYI TSIG LE'UR BYAS PA,
In Sanskrit, the Abhidharmakosha Karika.
In Tibetan, the Chu Ngunpay Dzu Kyi Tsikleur Jepa.
[In English, The Treasure House of Knowledge,
set in verse.]

In Sanskrit, the title of this work is the Abhidharmakosha Karika. In Tibetan,
this translates as Chu Ngunpay Dzu Kyi Tsikleur Jepa [or, in English, The
Treasure House of Knowledge, set in verse.] Abhidharma refers to "knowledge,"
kosha to "treasure house," and karika to "set in verse."

Now why do we bother mentioning the Sanskrit title of this commentary to the
Buddha's words? We want to indicate that the work is of reputable origin.
Buddhas of all three times, whether past or present or future, attain their
enlightenment at the Seat of the Diamond, in India. So the Indian name is
meant to show an origin in the seat of knowledge, India.

A commentary is worth no more or less than it is, but if people think it comes
from India they'll take the time to study and teach it, just because of the better
source. It's just like the local merchants. If they hear some barley has come
from the lowlands, right away they want to trade for it, because the source is
a good one.

A commentary may actually be excellent, but if you don't put some Sanskrit
in it nobody wants to work with it. They think it's just Tibetan. Like local
merchants who heard that some barley came from a highlands nook--nobody
wants to touch it, whether it's really good or bad.

Mentioning the title in Sanskrit has the further purpose of starting a mental
propensity for this excellent tongue. All Buddhas of the three times teach the
Dharma in Sanskrit after their enlightenment. An acquaintance with just this
small amount of the language acts as a mental seed, which will ripen into a
nearly automatic fluency. Finally, it helps one comprehend the differences in
word order between Tibetan and Sanskrit.

Why do we mention the title at the very start? It facilitates locating the proper
volume, and understanding its subject at a glance. Why put the Sanskrit and
Tibetan side by side? So we may recall the kindness of the master translators,
and strive to repay our debt to them.
We'll explain the actual import of the title later on; here first comes the
obeisance of the translator.

We now turn to the second part of our detailed treatment of the text's subject
matter: an explication of caused phenomena. In this regard we examine the
actual content of the text only after discussing its structure in three divisions:
a listing of the eight chapters, a demonstration of their interrelation, and a
description of the subject matter presented in each of the eight.

Master Purnavardhana presents the eight chapters of the Treasure House as
follows:
Eight chapters were written to elucidate in detail what
is indicated only briefly by the opening words of the
texts: "All phenomena, stained or without stain." the
first two of the chapters are devoted to a general
treatment of stained and unstained phenomena.
A detailed presentation of stained phenomena is left
to the next three chapters. The third, for example,
relates (1) who it is that is so very afflicted, (2) where
they live so very afflicted, and (3) how they are so very
afflicted. It does so with respective presentations on
(1) the five types of beings in the three realms--the
world of living beings; (2) the external world--the
"vessel" which holds these beings, and (3) the four
modes of birth and twelve links of dependent
origination. The fourth and fifth chapters describe
what it is that makes beings so very afflicted--stained
deeds and the mental afflictions.

The final three chapters give a detailed treatment of
unstained phenomena. Chapter Six covers who it is,
what kind of person, that is purified; where it is, the
place, that he is purified; and how it is, by what stages
of realization, that he is purified. Chapter Seven
concerns what it is that makes the person pure: as
sutra says, "Affliction is something wisdom must
destroy." Chapter Eight concerns meditation--that
which provides a base for wisdom to rely on--for as
sutra states again, "The mind in meditation gleans
pure reality."

Other masters of the past have outlined the eight in the following way:
The work is presented in eight chapters in order to
address three points: objects, activity, and result. In
general, all objects may be divided into two types:
apparent reality and actual reality. The first two
chapters are devoted to apparent reality; the third,
fourth, and fifth deal with actual reality--the four
truths. The sixth chapter explains the different types
of realization, whose sphere of activity is actual reality.
The result which is attained, wisdom, as well as other
personal attributes associated with it are treated in the
final two chapters.

As for the interrelation of these chapters, the first presents the general subject
matter addressed by the works on knowledge: stained and unstained
phenomena. The first chapter makes but a mere mention of the powers and
of the way in which caused phenomena arise; thus the following chapter, the
second, is devoted to a more detailed treatment of these two points. The
subject of the three realms, given only passing mention in these opening
chapters, is therefore explored in the third. Some believe that the three realms
thus presented are creations of some god, such as the one they call "Powerful";
the following, fourth chapter therefore disproves this idea and shows that the
real source is deeds.

The message of the next chapter, the fifth, is that the motivating force behind
the deeds outlined in Chapter Four is the widespread mental afflictions. The
sixth chapter is devoted to demonstrating a path by which we may eliminate
these afflictions, so naturally comes after their presentation. The seventh
chapter provides additional detail about the types of knowledge mentioned in
the sixth; the eighth, lastly, completes the interrelationship of the chapters by
enlarging upon the qualities which the Buddha possesses in common with
advanced beings at lower stages--these qualities and those unique to the
Buddha having first appeared in Chapter Seven.

,GSUM PA NI GZHUNG GI TSIG DON LAS SHES BAR 'GYUR RO,
The third point we have promised, a description of the subject matter
presented in each of the eight chapters, will be understood from the words of
the Master's work itself.

Having thus covered the pledge to compose the work with its preliminary
eulogy, we shall present the actual explanation of the work's title, the first
subject treated once the author has inspired himself for the work. The word
"knowledge" will be explained first, both by itself and, incidentally, with regard
to its accessories. Then we will speak of the expression "treasure house."

Knowledge and its Real Accessories

,CHOS MNGON SHES RAB DRI MED RJES 'BRANG BCAS,
Knowledge is unstained wisdom, and its accessories.
[I.5]

,DANG PO NI, CHOS MNGON MDZOD KYI BSTAN BCOS RAB BSHAD BYA, ZHES BSHAD NA, CHOS MNGON PA DE GANG ZHE NA, 'DI LA GNYIS YOD PA LAS 
Master Vasubandhu has promised "To write this commentary, the Treasure
House of Knowledge." But what does he mean by "knowledge"? There are two
types of such knowledge; we may describe the first in the form of a logical
statement:

ZAG MED KYI MTHONG SGOM MI SLOB LAM GSUM PO CHOS CAN, DON DAM PA'I CHOS MNGON PA YIN TE, DRI MA MED PA'I SHES RAB RJES 'BRANG DANG BCAS PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Consider the following three paths without stain: those of
seeing, habituation, and no further learning.
They are actual knowledge, because
They constitute unstained wisdom and its accessories.

GNYIS PA LA GNYIS, DON DAM PA'I CHOS MNGON PA'I RJES 'BRANG DANG , BRDAR BTAGS PA'I CHOS MNGON PA'I RJES 'BRANG GI DON LA DPYAD PA'O, , DANG PO LA GSUM, SA GANG LA BRTEN PA, RTEN BRTEN PA'I DON, 'KHOR DANG BCAS NA PHUNG PO DU BA YIN DPYAD PA'O,
Now the second portion of knowledge, its accessories, may further be
addressed in two divisions of real accessories to knowledge and merely
nominal accessories to knowledge. Real accessories to knowledge may be
considered in terms of the level upon which they rely, the meaning of reliance
in the present context, and an investigation into how many heaps knowledge
has, if you also count all which stand in attendance to it.

,DANG PO NI, 'O NA DE GSUM SA GANG LA BRTAN CE NA, MTHONG LAM NI BSAM GTAN SA DRUG GANG RUNG LA BRTEN PA YIN TE, SBYOR LAM CHOS MCHOG BSAM GTAN SA DRUG GANG RUNG LA BRTEN PA GANG ZHIG, MTHONG LAM DE CHOS MCHOG DANG SA GCIG PA'I PHYIR TE, DE NI CHOS MCHOG DANG SA GCIG, CES GSUNGS SO, , RTAGS DANG PO GRUB STE, SGOM BYUNG MI LCOGS MED PA DANG , KHYAD PAR BSAM GTAN SA PA'O, , ZHES GSUNGS,
On what levels do the three mentioned paths rely? The path of seeing may
rely on any of the six levels of concentration. This is because the final stage
of the path of preparation, known as "ultimate phenomenon," may itself rely
upon any of these six levels; and the path of seeing always relies upon the
same level as the stage of the ultimate phenomenon. As the scripture states,
"Same level as ultimate phenomenon." Scripture also confirms our assertion
that the ultimate-phenomenon stage can rely on any of the six levels:
Meditative at beyond no leisure,
Extraordinary concentration level too.

DE NYER BSDOGS LHAG MA RNAMS LA MI BRTEN TE, DE ZAG MED YIN LA NYER BSDOGS LHAG MA RNAMS ZAG BCAS ZHI RAGS KYI RNAM PA CAN YIN PA'I PHYIR, 'DOD PA LA MI BRTEN TE, 'DI MNYAM PAR BZHAG PA'I SA PA YIN LA, 'DOD PA MNYAM PAR MA BZHAG PA'I SA PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
The ultimate-phenomenon stage of the path of preparation does not, however,
rely on preliminary levels other than the one mentioned. The stage beyond no
leisure is free of stain, whereas the remaining stages are stained--they are
levels wherein one's state of realization derives only from making distinctions
between more or less subtle levels of experience. Nor can the ultimate stage
of the path of preparation ever rely on the desire level, for the stage is one of
controlled meditation, and the desire level is not.

Neither can the ultimate stage rely upon any one of the first three formless
levels, for at these levels one is incapable of focusing upon the desire
level--and during the path of seeing one must. Finally, it is impossible for the
ultimate stage to rely on the "peak" level--the fourth of the formless levels--for
one's ability to discriminate at this level is too unclear.

ZAG MED SGOM LAM DANG MI SLOB LAM NI ZAG MED SA DGU GANG RUNG LA BRTEN NO,
The unstained path of habituation, as well as that of no further learning, may
both rely on any one of the nine unstained levels.

Now what we mean by "reliance" in the above discussion is not the kind of
reliance you might imagine, where the pole of a banner is propped up in one
of those chimney-like tubes in the corner of the roof to a Tibetan house. Rather
the path, or mental realization, actually consists of the particular level it relies
upon.

How many heaps does knowledge have, if you count all of those which are
attendant to it? Knowledge can be said to have all five heaps, since unstained
wisdom comes along with non-communicating form included within unstained
restraint. Feeling is present as pleasure of thought if the wisdom relies on the

first two concentration levels. Where it relies on the third, mental pleasure is
had. Reliance on other levels, of neutral feeling, means that neutral feeling is
present. Discrimination is there as an attendant to consciousness of one's
thoughts, as well as the heap of other factors--be they mental functions or the
factors not associated with mind--along with consciousness.

Someone may object that it is improper to speak of consciousness of one's
thoughts as being "attendant" to unstained wisdom, since mind itself must be
considered more primary than mental functions. Generally the relationship is
so, but in the context of an ultimate analysis of phenomena wisdom must be
treated as the more primary. If the context had been the subject of belief, for
example, we could even have considered faith more principal.

,GZUGS MED NA NI GZUGS KYI RJES 'BRANG MED PAS PHUNG PO BZHI PA CAN YIN NO,
With regard to the formless realm, no accessory to knowledge possessing form
would be present, and thus only four of the heaps had in attendance.

There are a number of accessories to knowledge which are merely nominal.
Those include first the wisdoms of learning, contemplation, and meditation,
which are practiced in order "to achieve it"--actual knowledge. Second there
is that amount of wisdom with which one is born. Finally there are the
classical commentaries which take these very types of wisdom as their subject
matter. These include The Practice of Wisdom and similar works.

Let us use the form of a logical statement:
Consider the accessories to knowledge just mentioned.
They may be given the name "knowledge," because
They constitute the means or cause of one's achieving actual
knowledge.

What is the actual process of causation here? Untainted wisdom springs from
meditative wisdom, which comes from contemplative wisdom, which derives
from the wisdom of learning--all dependent upon the wisdom with which one
was born.
Calling these accessories "knowledge" serves a specific purpose: the author is
trying to tell us that they must be relied upon as methods, or causes, for
achieving real knowledge. In actual point of fact they could never be
knowledge, since they are stained.

'O NA GSUM PO SA GANG NA YOD CE NA, SKYES THOB KYI SHES RAB NI KHAMS GSUM GA NA YOD,
At what level can each of the three accessories mentioned be found? The
wisdom with which one is born exists in all three realms.

Wisdom derived from learning is found in the lower two realms but never in
the formless, since there is no hearing sound in that realm. Contemplative
wisdom exists in the desire but not in the higher two realms, since there the
mere act of starting to turn the mind towards an object sets off one-pointed
concentration. Meditative wisdom, on the other hand, appears only in these
higher realms and never in the desire, since it is not a level where there exists
any controlled meditation.

The classical commentaries, if we consider them as the actual sound of speech,
exist only in the desire realm and are absent from the higher two: as the
Treasure House itself reads, "Communicating at those with examining." If on
the other hand we consider these commentaries as names, words, and letters,
they can be said to exist in the lower two realms but not in the formless: again
the Treasure House states, "Included in the desire, form; animate."

Where does the word "knowledge" [Sanskrit: abhidharma] come from? A
phenomenon [dharma] is that which possesses [dhr¸] a nature. And knowledge
brings to [abhi] you, or leads you to [abhi] that highest of all existing
phenomena: nirvana.

Master Vasubandhu has stated: "I shall write this commentary, The Treasure
House of Knowledge." Just how is it a treasure house of knowledge? The very
most prized points of the Seven Works on Knowledge all fit here in the
points, in the subject matter, of the Master's commentary. The scabbard in
which you sheathe a sword, for example, is called the "scabbard of the sword,"
and the place where you deposit your riches is termed the "treasure house of
riches."

You could also say that the Seven works on Knowledge are themselves the

the place from where the sword was drawn.

Giving an explanation of knowledge has the following purpose. Without
wisdom which analyzes every phenomenon in an ultimate way, there is no
way of putting to rest all that the mental afflictions imply. And this
affliction is what keeps those of the world adrift here in the ocean of life.
It is therefore necessary to plant, in students' minds, wisdom which can make
this ultimate analysis of phenomena. Thus the explanation.

The Master, moreover, has good reason to honor the exposition of knowledge.
He knows that, first, it plants the wisdom of ultimate analysis in the minds of
students. Secondly, it has been spoken by the Teacher.

"Why do you say that the exposition of knowledge is spoken by the Teacher?"
one may object. "Are you trying to say that the Seven Works on Knowledge
were not composed by the enemy destroyers?" In answer, we may say that

they are the speech of the Teacher. Even the great enemy destroyers would
have been unable to make the first descriptions of the nature and then
divisions of existing phenomena had they not relied upon the Buddha.

The Buddha first delivered various teachings, according to the states of mind
or inquiries of his disciples. The scattered records of these teachings were later
taken by the Venerable Katyayaniputra and others, and collected into such
works as The Practice of Wisdom. The Venerable Dharmatrata, for example, has
taken a whole group of scattered sutras, delivered at various places and times,
addressing the needs of various students with counsel such as "Alas! All things
with causes must change!" He has arranged these various teachings into a
group, but they remain the word of the Teacher. So too with the Seven.

The entire point may be summarized in an extended logical statement:
The works on knowledge are nothing less than
the word of the Teacher, because
The enemy destroyers have only made them into
collections,
Analogous to the sections of sutra and
vowed morality found in the canon, for
They are only collections made by the
Arya Kashyapa.
Thus they say.

This expression, "Thus they say," is meant to indicate that another school of
philosophers holds a different view. The so-called "Sutrists" assert the
following:
That these explanations constitute the speech of the
Teacher is a belief held by the followers of the
"Knowledge" group within the Detailist school of
philosophy. We however cannot accept this tenet, for
many statements appear in these texts which are
contrary to logic. One example is the claim that
phenomena not produced by causes exist as material
entities. Moreover, everybody knows there are lots of
other authors who have composed such works on
knowledge. They are the works of enemy destroyers,
not collections of the Buddha's speech.

Master Purnavardhana attributes the Types of Beings to Shariputra.
"Why is the one school," you may ask, "known as the `Sutrists.'?" This school
of philosophers holds that sutra is valid, but denies the validity of classical
commentaries such as the Seven Works on Knowledge. The Detailists respond
with the following criticism:

'O NA MDO LAS, DGE SLONG SDE SNOD GSUM PA ZHES 'BYUNG BA'I SDE SNOD

Well then, what about the expression "monk who has
mastered all three sections of the scriptures," which
occurs in sutra itself? How are you going to come up
with three sections of scripture? We don't see any
section on knowledge apart from these very works.

The Sutrists counter:
This is not a problem. Those works within the sutra
section devoted to the delineation of what is
ultimately real and to the defining characteristics of
phenomena constitute in themselves a discrete section
on knowledge.
So they say.

"Now why is the other school," one might continue, "known as the `Detailists'?"
One may say that they are "Detailists" because they devote their study
exclusively to the classical commentary known as Detailed Exposition, or else
because they understand the Exposition's meaning. The school itself may be
further divided into a number of groups. Those who reside in Kashmir are
known as the "Kashmiris," while those who live in the western part of the
same land are known as the "Westerners." Detailists in areas other than
Kashmir, those in central India and so forth, are referred to collectively as those
"Under the Sun."

Now the lines beginning with "There's no way to put the mental afflictions to
rest..." also indicate that Master Vasubandhu's commentary possesses the four
requisite attributes of a reputable work. Again we may use the form of a
logical statement:
Consider the act of making a statement of purpose, and of a
relation of the text to that purpose, here at the beginning of the
commentary.
It has a purpose of its own, because
It conveys to disciples the fact that the commentary possesses the
four attributes of a reputable work. Once they realize that these
attributes are present, disciples will be inspired to study the text.

Here are the four attributes:
1) The subject matter of the text concerns stained and unstained types
of phenomena. It is indicated in the verse with the words "every
existing phenomenon."
2) The purpose is to utilize this subject matter to plant, in students'
minds, that wisdom which analyzes phenomena in an ultimate
way. It is indicated by the words "ultimate analysis."

3) The ultimate goal is to have these students achieve nirvana, both
with and without anything remaining. It is indicated indirectly by
the entire phrase running from "There's no way..." up to
"...without," and on from "this affliction..." up to the word "Thus."
4) A relation exists in that the purpose must be achieved through the
subject matter of the work, and the ultimate goal through this very
purpose.
One may also state the relation as being between the subject matter of the
work (that is, all existing phenomena) and the means by which this subject
matter is expressed (i.e., the commentary itself).

Demonstrating that the work possesses the four attributes serves its own
purpose. Master Dharmottara explains that
It functions to satisfy any doubts that a student might
have about whether the commentary has any purpose;
if so, whether one could ever achieve that purpose; if
so, whether anyone would want to; and, if so, whether
there exists any relationship between the text and the
realization of its proclaimed purpose.

Master Vinitadeva is in no disagreement:
A statement of just these four attributes serves to allay
any suspicions a person might have that the work
might lack any subject matter, or be without a
purpose, or lead to no desirable ultimate goal, or that
these three might bear no relation to each other. The
statement thus inspires students to take up the
commentary.

Someone may make the following objection:
If the mere claims that the work possesses these
attributes is enough to remove any doubts that it does
not, then the simple statement "Sound is a changing
thing" should be enough to remove any misconception
that sound is lasting. If the latter is true, it must be an
exercise in futility for the classic proofs to go on and
give a reason followed by a supporting example, to
prove the point of sound's impermanence.

'ON TE MI SEL NA DGOS PA STON PA'I NGAG GIS KYANG MI SEL BAR 'GYUR

And suppose the statement about sound is not enough to stop the
misconception by itself. How then can the assertion about the
attributes suffice to end a student's doubts? For the two cases are
exactly the same.

Sages reply to such an objection as follows:
Telling someone that sound is changing is enough to
prevent his believing that sound is something lasting.
Giving him then a reason and supporting example
serves to plant the opposing, accurate belief in his
mind, removing the uncertainty and lack of correct
ideas left behind by stopping his wrong belief.

One may ask if any of the four attributes is such that one subsumes another.
The purpose, its ultimate purpose, and the relationship of the content to the
purpose are, all of them, subsumed by the subject matter--for this subject
matter includes every existing phenomenon. Neither of the purpose of its
ultimate purpose subsumes the other, since they are cause and effect.

'O NA CHOS MNGON PA'I NYID DGOS MYANG 'DAS GNYIS SO SO'I NGO BO DANG KHYAD PAR CI YIN ZHE NA,
Yet another question may be raised:
You've mentioned that the ultimate goal of knowledge
is achieving the two types of nirvana. Can you list
each one's basic nature, as well as characteristic
features?"

According to the Listener system, nirvana where something still remains is
described as having both achieved and actualized a cessation resulting from
analysis, an elimination of the true condition of the source of all suffering,
which implies deeds and mental afflictions. At the same time, one has
achieved but not actualized a cessation where he has eliminated suffering.
Something "remains" because one still undergoes some one or more of the
three types of suffering.

We can see occurrences in sutra of persons who had attained this nirvana, who
were living in desire-realm bodies and still had to go through outright
suffering. Arya Gurchung, for example, was forced to consume a soup of
water and ashes, which killed him. The Arya Udayin was decapitated in a
brothel. We hear of a self-made Buddha who died from a wound inflicted by
a poisoned arrow. Even the Buddha himself was pricked by the sandalwood
thorn, suffered from backache, and bled where he was hit from the fragments
of shells hurled by Devadatta's catapult.

Enemy destroyers reside in all three realms; those at the first three levels of
concentration have but the last two kinds of suffering left: the first is
completely absent there. Those at the fourth concentration level and beyond
have only the last suffering, the pervasive kind of mortality itself, remaining
still.

Given the above, we can say that one achieves nirvana without anything left
over when he actually brings about a cessation in which every one of the
stained heaps has been stopped. The Anthology of Advices concurs:
The body dissolves, feeling's finally cooled,
End of discrimination, demise of the other
Factors--consciousness fades away.
Such one has seen the end of suffering.

It should be noted that the above view is only that of the present school.
According to the great vehicle, the freedom achieved by listeners and self-made
victors is not a final sort of freedom. Moreover, the prick of His foot by the
sandalwood thorn and the other events mentioned above were only a show

that the Buddha put on for the sake of His disciples. Actually the Buddha is
completely incapable of suffering, for He has liberated himself from every
possible problem, ranging from those of a normal suffering life up to those of
a lower nirvana. The sutra known as Developing the Three Bodies of a Buddha
does though speak of the two form bodies of the Buddha as being nirvana with
something remaining, and of the phenomena body as being a nirvana with
nothing remaining.

Master Jinaputra summarizes as follows:
The whole purpose of explicating knowledge is to
make one a master of subjects such as the heaps and
so on. Two benefits spring from such mastery. One's
own focus helps him to develop such qualities as
mental quietude. And when discoursing with others,
he will feel full confidence to expound on any
question.

We turn now to our commentary on the "Presentation of Deeds," which
constitutes the fourth chapter of the Treasure House of Knowledge. First we
relate the present chapter to the one just finished, and then continue with the
exposition of deeds itself.
1
What Causes Worlds

,LAS LAS 'JIG RTEN SNA TSOGS SKYES,
Deeds cause the multitude of worlds.
[IX.1]

GONG DU BSHAD PA'I SNOD BCUD KYI 'JIG RTEN SNA TSOGS PA 'DI GANG LAS BYUNG ZHE NA, RGYU MED DANG MI MTHUN PA'I RGYU LAS BYUNG BA MA YIN TE, RES 'GA' SKYE BA DANG , DBANG PHYUG SOGS MIN RIM SOGS PHYIR, , ZHES BSHAD PA'I PHYIR,
One may begin with the following question: "You have just described a
multitude of worlds--both the great vessels of the outer worlds and the living
beings they contain. Where do they all come from?" They do not come from
no cause at all, and they do not come from causes that are inconsistent with
their own nature. This is because they stay for some time, then go away; and
as the root text said itself, "Not an almighty one or the like, because of stages
and such."

'O NA GANG LAS SKYES ZHE NA, LAS LAS SNOD BCUD KYI 'JIG RTEN SNA TSOGS PA SKYES SO,
What then does cause them? It is the past deeds of living beings that cause all
the multitude of worlds--both the places and the people.

,GNYIS PA LA, LAS KYI NGO BO, MDO LAS 'BYUNG BA'I MING GI RNAM GRANGS SO, , DANG PO LA, BSTAN, BSHAD DO, DANG PO NI,
The exposition that follows now on deeds is divided into two parts: first on the
basic nature of deeds, and secondly on listings from sutra on the different
types of deeds. The former is itself presented first in a brief introduction and
then in a more detailed treatment.
2
Introduction to Deeds

,DE NI SEMS PA DANG DES BYAS,
,SEMS PA YID KYI LAS YIN NO,
,DES BSKYED LUS DANG NGAG GI LAS,
,DE DAG RNAM RIG RNAM RIG MIN,
They're movement of the mind and what it brings.
Mental movement is a deed of thought;
What it causes, deeds of body and speech.
These are either communicating or not.
[IV.2-5]

LAS LAS 'JIG RTEN SNA TSOGS SKYES, ZHES BSHAD NA, LAS DE LA DBYE NA DU ZHE NA, LAS DE NI GNYIS SU YOD DE, SEMS PA'I LAS DANG , SEMS PA DES BYAS PA'I BSAM PA'I LAS GNYIS SU YOD PA'I PHYIR,
"In the line above," one might continue, "you said that `deeds cause the
multitude of worlds.' Just how many types of deeds are there?"
They--deeds--are of two different types: deeds consisting of movement of the
mind, and the deeds that it brings--those that the mind motivates.

DE DAG GI NGO BO GANG ZHE NA, SEMS PA NI YID KYI LAS YIN TE, YID KYI RNAM PAR SHES PA DANG MTSUNGS LDAN GYI LAS YIN PA'I PHYIR, SEMS PA DES BSKYED PA'I BSAM PA'I LAS LA LUS KYI LAS DANG , NGAG GI LAS GNYIS, DE DAG LA'ANG RNAM PAR RIG BYED DANG RNAM PAR RIG BYED MA YIN PA GNYIS GNYIS YOD DO,
One may ask about each of their basic natures. Mental movement is a deed
of the thought, for it consists of a deed linked with consciousness of the
thought. What it causes--that is, deeds motivated by the mind--are of two
kinds: these are deeds of the body and deeds of speech. These two
themselves can be further divided into two types each: they are either what we
call "communicating" or not.

,GNYIS PA LA, LAS KYI RANG BZHIN, LAS GSUM SPYI'I CHOS KYI KHYAD PAR, RNAM PAR RIG BYED MA YIN PA'I DBYE BA'O,
Our more detailed treatment of these points continues in three steps: the
definition of a deed, typical features of the three types of deeds in general, and
different divisions of non-communicating types of deeds.

,DANG PO LA, RNAM PAR RIG BYED DANG , RNAM PAR RIG BYED MA YIN PA'O, , DANG PO LA, LUS KYI RNAM PAR RIG BYED DANG , NGAG GI RNAM PAR RIG BYED DO,
In discussing the definition of a deed we will cover first the communicating,
and then the non-communicating types. The former will be described first for
those of the body, and then for those of speech.
3
Communicating Deeds of the Body

,LUS RNAM RIG BYED DBYIBS SU 'DOD,
Body communicating held to be shape.
[IV.6]

,DANG PO NI, DE DAG RNAM RIG RNAM RIG MIN, ZHES BSHAD NA, LUS KYI RNAM PAR RIG BYED KYI LAS DE GANG ZHE NA, BYE BRAG SMRA BA NA RE, LUS KYI RNAM PAR RIG BYED NI, PHYAG 'TSAL BA DANG SROG GCOD PA LA SOGS PA'I GNAS SKABS KYI BYA BA LA GNAS PA'I SEMS PAS KUN NAS BSLANGS PA'I LUS KYI DBYIBS SU 'DOD DO,
"You mentioned," one might start, "a line just now saying `these are either
communicating or not.' Can you describe the types of bodily deeds that are
said to be `communicating'?" Communicating deeds of the body are held in
the present school to be the shape that the physical body takes under
motivation by movements of the mind present for the duration of specific
actions such as prostrating oneself before a holy object or taking the life of a
sentient being.

Non-Communicating Form

,G-YENGS DANG SEMS MED PA YI YANG ,

,'BYUNG BA CHE RNAMS RGYUR BYAS PA,
,DE NI RNAM RIG BYED MIN BRJOD,
Even during distraction, while mind is stopped,
Virtue or not, continuing after,
Taking the great elements as its causes,
This form we say does not communicate.
[I.41-4]

,GSUM PA RNAM PAR RIG BYED MA YIN PA'I GZUGS BSHAD PA NI, RNAM RIG BYED MIN ZHES BSHAD NA, RNAM PAR RIG BYED MA YIN PA'I GZUGS DE GANG ZHE NA,
Someone may begin:
What about the line above that ends with the words
"...and non-communicating"? What do you mean by
"non-communicating form"?

DE NI KHYAD PAR LNGA DANG LDAN PA YIN TE, GNAS SKABS KYI KHYAD PAR SEMS G-YENGS PA DANG , SEMS MED PA'I SNYOMS 'JUG GNYIS KYI GNAS SKABS NA YANG YOD PA DANG ,
This form which does not communicate possesses five distinctive features.
The first is a feature of period: this type of form is present even during periods
when one is distracted, or while one is engaged in a controlled meditation
where mind is stopped.

DE TZAM ZHIG MIG LA SOGS PA LA YANG YOD PAS NGO BO'I KHYAD PAR DGE BA DANG MI DGE BA GANG RUNG YIN PA, , DE TZAM ZHIG RNAM PAR RIG BYED LA YANG YOD PAS DUS KYI KHYAD PAR RGYUN MCHOG TU RJES SU 'BREL BA, DE TZAM ZHIG DGE MI DGE'I THOB PA LA YANG YOD PAS 'BYUNG BA CHEN PO BZHE RNAMS RGYUR BYAS PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
This much is also true of the eye and so on, so that we must mention a feature
of essence: this form is either virtuous or not. The description so far could
apply to communicating form as well, so a feature of time is included: non-
communicating form continues on after a deed, in a perfect stream. As much
could also be said of virtuous and non-virtuous holds, and thus we note that
this form takes the great elements as its causes.

DE LA KHA CHE 'DUN BZANG NA RE, 'DI LA MA TSANG BSTAN BCOS 'GAL, NYAMS DANG DE MIN DE NYID THAL, , YANG SGRA LHAG BRJOD KHYAD PAR DU, , BYA BA KHYAD PAR MA BYAS SO, , ZHES MTSAN NYID DE SUN 'BYIN TE,
The Kashmiri Sanghabhadra [?] attacks this definition with the following verse:
It's incomplete, contradicts classical
Commentary, one then is not,
One not then is. "Even's" superfluous,
A feature not mentioned should be.

RNAM PAR RIG BYED MA YIN PA'I GZUGS SKAD CIG DANG PO CHOS CAN, RNAM PAR RIG BYED MA YIN PA'I GZUGS MIN PAR THAL, RGYUN MCHOG TU RJES SU 'BREL BA MA TSANG PA'I PHYIR, DE CHOS CAN, RDZAS YOD MIN PAR THAL, RGYUN YIN PA'I PHYIR, 'DOD NA, BSTAN BCOS LAS RDZAS YOD DU BSHAD PA DANG 'GAL,
He explains his criticism as follows:
Let's consider some non-communicating form at the
first instant of its existence. According to you, it could
never be non-communicating form, because it is
incomplete--it lacks the feature of continuing on in a
perfect stream. Consider this form again. According
to you, it could also never be a substantial thing,
because it's a stream. And if you go ahead and agree
that it is not substantial, you contradict the classical
commentaries which explain that it is.

YANG TING NGE 'DZIN LAS SKYES PA'I RNAM PAR RIG BYED MA YIN PA'I YI GZUGS CHOS CAN, RNAM PAR RIG BYED MA YIN PA'I GZUGS YIN PA NYAMS PAR THAL, G-YENGS PA DANG SEMS MED PA'I GNAS SKABS NA MED PA'I PHYIR TE, MA G-YENGS PA DANG SEMS DANG BCAS PA'I GNAS SKABS NA YO DANG SA SO, ,
Consider further the non-communicating form that is created by
single-pointed concentration. If your definition is correct, then it
is not non-communicating form. This is because it does not exist
during particular periods when one is distracted, or while mind is
stopped; rather, it is present during periods when one is not
distracted, and when the mind is functioning.

RNAMS PAR RIG BYED MIN PA'I GZUGS DE MIN PA RNAM PAR RIG BYED KYI GZUGS CHOS CAN, RNAM PAR RIG BYED MA YIN PA'I GZUGS SU THAL, MA G-YENGS PA DANG SEMS DANG BCAS PA'I GNAS SKABS NA YOD PA'I PHYIR, YANG SGRA LHAG STE,  SEMS G-YENGS

Take too what is not this kind of form at all: form which does
communicate intent. If you are right then it is form which doesn't
communicate intent, because it is present during periods without
distraction, and with a functioning mind. Moreover, the word
"even" is superfluous: when you state that this type of form is there
when the mind is distracted, everyone understands that it is also
present at times when the mind is functioning. You have, finally,
also made the mistake of not mentioning a feature which should have
been: the fact that this type of form is invisible and ineffable.

'DUN BZANG RANG GI LUGS LA, BYAS PA DANG YANG MI 'DRA BA'I, , SEMS PA'ANG SEMS MED PA LA GANG , , LUNG BSTAN THOGS PA MED PA RIG GZUGS, , DE NI RNAM RIG BYED MIN BRJOD, , CES DE'I MTSAN NYID 'JOG PAR BYED DO,
Sanghabhadra [?] then presents an alternative definition, in the following verse
of his own:
Form different from the one
You made: during thought and also
Not, specified, ineffable,
This does "not communicate."

,LUGS GNYIS KA LTAR NA'ANG MA G-YENGS SEMS BCAS KYI RJES SU BYED PAS DER 'DOD NA, RIG BYED KYANG DER THAL BA DANG , SEMS MED KYI RJES SU BYED PAS DER 'DOD NA TING NGE 'DZIN LAS SKYES PA'I SDOM PA GNYIS DE MIN PAR THAL BA'I NYES PA SO NA GNAS SO, ,
Both of the above systems, nonetheless, amount to the same inconsistency. If
you establish something as non-communicating form because it relates to
periods when the mind is not distracted, or functioning, then form which does

communicate intent must also not communicate it. And if on the other hand
you establish something as non-communicating because it relates to periods
where the mind is stopped, then the two restraints which arise from single-
pointed concentration could never be non-communicating.

,LEGS SPYAD DANG NYES SBYAD DE LAS CHE LONG RAGS PA BSDUS NAS NI, DGE BA DANG MI DGE BA CI RIGS PAR LAS KYI LAM NI BCU BCUR GSUNGS SO,
A very gross abbreviation of all of them--of all right and wrong
activities--was stated as the ten paths of action, whether we are talking about
the ten virtuous types or the ten types which are not virtuous.

,'O NA GANG MA BSDUS ZHE NA, SROG GCOD LTA BU'I SBYOR MJUG DANG , NGAG GI TSABS CHE BA MA GTOGS CHUNG BA MA BSDUS, YID KYI SEMS PA MA BSDUS,
One may ask just what is not included in such an abbreviation. Certain steps
of a particular act, say that of taking life, are not included. These would be the
steps known as "undertaking" or "conclusion." Neither have we included any
but the most serious forms of action in speech; mental movement as an
element in deeds of the thought has been omitted too.

DGE BA LAS LUS KYI SBYOR MJUG DANG , NGAG GI SNYEN PAR SMRA BA LTA BU DANG , YID KYI SEMS PA MA BSDUS SO,
As for virtues, the above abbreviation again leaves out the "undertaking" and
"conclusion" steps for actions of the body. Examples of virtue in one's speech,
such as speaking sweetly, are omitted--as is mental movement in deeds of the
thought.

Our more detailed treatment of what we call a "path of action" includes seven
different parts:
1) the relative certainty of whether a given action includes types
of form that either do or do not communicate one's intentions;
2) the division of each of the paths of action into three different
types;
3) the details of non-virtuous paths of action;
4) the ways in which one loses, and then regains, his most basic
virtues;
5) how many paths of action can occur together with movement
of the mind;
6) what paths of action are found in which realms, and among
what types of beings; and
7) the results of the paths of action.

[IV.30b-6]

One may ask whether virtue and the rest are established only on the basis of
the motivation involved. They are not; in fact, there are four different
divisions, beginning with what we call "ultimate" virtue. How do we describe
them?

THAR PA CHOS CAN, DAM PA'I DON DU DGE BA YIN TE, SDUG BSNGAL MA LUS PA DANG BRAL BAS MCHOG TU BDE BA'I PHYIR, DPER NA, SKYES BU RANG BZHIN GYIS NAD MED PA BZHIN, DGE BA'I RTZA BA GSUM DANG NGO TSA SHES PA DANG KHREL YOD CHOS CAN, NGO BO NYID KYIS DGE 
BA YIN TE, GZHAN LA MA LTOS PAR BDAG NYID KYIS DGE BA YIN PA'I PHYIR, DPER NA, 'PHROD PA'I SMAN BZHIN,
First consider freedom--nirvana. It is the ultimate virtue, for it is the highest
state of happiness, free of every single suffering. It's like a totally healthy
person. Next consider the three roots of virtue, as well as a sense of shame
and a conscience. They are virtue by nature, for they are virtue in and of
themselves, without relying on anything else. They are like medicinal herbs.
 DE DAG DANG MTSUNGS PAR LDAN PA'I SEMS SEMS BYUNG RNAMS CHOS CAN, MTSUNGS LDAN GYIS DGE BA YIN TE, MTSUNGS LDAN DGE BAS DGE BAR BZHAG PA'I PHYIR, DPER NA, 'PHROD PA'I SMAN DANG SBYAR BA'I BTUNG BA BZHIN,
Still further let us take those instances of mind and mental functions that are
joined in a mental link with them--with these virtues. They are "mental-link"
virtue, for we establish them as virtue by the fact that they share a mental link
with virtue. They are, for example, like the liquid in which you mix your
medicinal herbs.

DE DAG GIS KUN NAS BSLANGS PA'I LUS NGAG GI BYA BA LA SOGS PA CHOS CAN, KUN SLONG GIS DGE BA YIN TE, KUN SLONG DGE BAS DGE BAR BZHAG PA'I PHYIR, DPER NA, 'PHROD PA'I SMAN DANG SBYAR BA'I BTUNG BA LAS BYUNG BA'I 'O MA BZHIN,
Next consider physical and verbal actions and the like--the things that are
motivated by the mental elements just described. They are what we call
"motivational" virtue, for they are considered virtue by reason of the virtuous
motivation involved with them. We can compare them to the milk that a
mother produces after she has drunk the liquid mixed with the medicinal herbs
described.

The opposites of each of the above are what we call "non-virtue"; the process
is as follows. First take the cycle of life. It is the ultimate non-virtue, for it is
the highest form of unhappiness--total bondage in suffering. It is like an
illness.

MI DGE BA'I RTZA BA GSUM DANG NGO TSA MED PA DANG KHREL MED CHOS CAN, NGO BO NYID KYIS MI DGE BA YIN TE, GZHAN LA MA LTOS PAR BDAG NYID KYIS MI DGE BA YIN PA'I PHYIR, MI 'PHROD PA'I SMAN BZHIN,
Next consider the three root non-virtues, as well as shamelessness and the lack
of a conscience. They are non-virtue by nature, for they are non-virtue in and
of themselves, without relying on anything else. They are like poisonous
herbs.

Then consider instances of mind and mental functions which share a mental
link with these non-virtues. They are "mental-link" non-virtue, for we establish
them as non-virtue because they share a mental link with non-virtue. These
we can compare to a liquid in which the poisonous herbs were mixed.

Let's next take the deeds of body and speech motivated by the mental elements
described. These are "motivational" non-virtue, for we establish them as non-
virtue through the non-virtuous motivation involved. These types resemble the
milk that a mother gives after she has drunk the liquid mixed with the
poisonous herbs.

The ultimate in the things which are ethically neutral consist of those
instances we have described previously: non-analytic cessations and
unproduced space.

The Nature of Motivation

,RAB TU 'JUG BYED YIN YID NI,
,BSGOM PAS SPANG BYA GNYIS KA YIN,
,LNGA NI RJES SU 'JUG BYED YIN,
Two types of motivation: causal and
The one we give the name of "at the time."
The first of the two acts to set you off;
The second's function is to make you continue.
The consciousness eliminated by seeing
Is the one which starts. The thought for both
Eliminated by habituation.
The five function in continuation.
[IV.37-44]

PA'I LTA BA DE LAS LOG PAR RTOG PA DANG LOG PA'I NGAG DANG LOG PA'I LAS KYI MTHA' 'BYUNG BAR BSHAD PA DANG 'GAL LO ZHE NA,
One may begin as follows:
You have stated above that the communicating type of
form can never be motivated by something which is
eliminated by the path of seeing. Sutra though
explains that mistaken views lead to mistaken
thoughts, mistaken speech, and mistaken activity.
Isn't there a contradiction here?

MI 'GAL TE, SPYIR KUN SLONG LA RNAM PA GNYIS TE, RGYU DUS KYI KUN SLONG DANG NI DE'I DUS KYI KUN SLONG ZHES BYA BA GNYIS YOD PA LAS, DANG PO NI BYA BA DE LA MA ZHUGS PAR 'DI DANG 'DI BYA'O ZHES RAB TU 'JUG PAR BYED PA DANG , GNYIS PA NI DE'I RJES SU BYA BA 'DI BYA'O ZHES RJES SU 'JUG BYED YIN LA,
There is not. In general, all motivation may be divided into two types: the
motivation had during the causal stages of a deed and the one we give the
name of "motivation at the time." The first of the two acts to set you off: this
is where you say before any particular action, "I'm going to do this or that."
The second's function is to make you continue on: this is where you say to
yourself after you've already started, "Now I'll do this act."

DE'I NANG NAS MTHONG BAS SPANG BYA'I RNAM SHES NI RAB TU 'JUG BYED YIN PAS MDO LAS DE LA DGONGS LA, 'DIR DUS KYI KUN SLONG MA YIN PA'I DBANG DU BYAS PA'I PHYIR,
Now among these two, the consciousness eliminated by the path of seeing is
the first, the one which starts you off on an action. This is the one that the
sutra was referring to; when we made our statement, we were talking about
how it couldn't be the motivation during the time of the action.

The thought for both kinds of motivation includes types that are eliminated
by the path of habituation, for it involves conceptions and is directed
outwards. The five sense consciousnesses function only in continuation of a
deed, for they are types of awareness that do not involve conception but which
are directed outwards.
We continue now with certain relevant features of motivation.

Certain Features of Motivation

From starting types of virtue and the rest,
Come three types of continuation as well.
For the Able the same, or that one virtue.
Those that come from ripening are neither.

One may ask whether it is assured that starting types of motivation that are
virtuous or whatever will lead to continuing types of motivation that are also
virtuous or such. From each of the starting types, from those of virtue and
the rest, come all three types of continuation as well--whether it be virtue,
non-virtue, or the ethically neutral.

For the Able Ones they are the same: starting types of motivation which have
a virtuous nature lead to continuing types that are also virtue, and starting
motivations of an ethically neutral character lead to continuing motivations that
are neutral too. Or their starting motivations that are ethically neutral can lead
to continuing motivations that are virtue. With the Able Ones though you can
never have a continuing motivation which is ethically neutral coming from a
starting motivation of virtue, for these beings' motivation never digresses.

Some people make the following claim:
The Able Ones are never in any state of mind other
than that of balanced meditation. They therefore
possess no ethically neutral states of mind. For
support we have the verse from sutra that says,
Even as he goes, the elephant meditates.
Even as he rises, the elephant meditates.
Even as he sleeps, the elephant meditates.
Even as he stays, the elephant meditates.

GSHEGS PAR 'DU SHES PA SOGS LA DGONGS PA'I PHYIR ZHES ZER,
In reply to this assertion the Detailists make a claim of their own:
This is no proof that they can never have any state of
mind that is not one of balanced meditation. The
quotation is only referring to the way the Ones Thus
Gone think as they act in any of the four different
ways: when they are going somewhere, they conceive
of themselves as going somewhere, and so on.

Those things that come about from a ripening of past deeds are neither the
starting type of motivation or the continuing type. This is because their
appearance does not rely on any particular application of effort--they just
come out on their own.
This completes our discussion of the typical features of the three types of deeds
in general. We move on now to the different divisions of non-communicating
types of deeds, beginning with a brief summary and continuing to a more
detailed treatment.
As for the first, non-communicating form can be understood as having three
different types. These are vows, anti-vows, and those other than these two.

The Treasure House of Chim [Chim Jampey Yang's commentary to the
Abhidharmakosha] states:
Sutra describes three kinds of karma: virtuous karma,
non-virtuous karma, and neutral karma. Virtue is that
karma which, in the short term, brings you a karmic
ripening which is desirable (that is, a feeling of
pleasure), and ultimately protects you from suffering
(that is, helps you achieve nirvana). Non-virtue is that
karma which brings you a karmic ripening which is
undesirable (that is, a feeling of pain). A neutral deed,
something neither virtuous nor non-virtuous, is that
karma which brings you something which is neither
desirable nor undesirable.

Definitions of the Basic Types of Deeds

,LAS BDE MI BDE DANG GZHAN NI,
,DGE DANG MI DGE DANG GZHAN YIN,
Deeds for the pleasant, unpleasant, and other--
Virtuous, non-virtuous, and other.
[IV.177-8]

"Just how," one may ask, "do you describe virtuous, non-virtuous, and ethically
neutral deeds?" Deeds that lead to a pleasant experience are virtuous deeds.
Those that lead to an unpleasant experience, an experience of suffering, are
non-virtuous. Deeds that lead to some "other" type of experience--that is,
which bring on a neutral experience--are themselves the "other" type of deeds:
those which are ethically neutral.
Our second group includes divisions of deeds according to their results; we
begin with a brief introduction and continue to a more detailed treatment.
49
Deeds According to Result

,BSOD NAMS BSOD NAMS MIN MI G-YO,
,BDE BA MYONG 'GYUR LA SOGS GSUM,
Merit, non-merit, those which are unshifting;

Now deeds may be divided into three different types: deeds which represent
merit, non-merit, or those which are unshifting. They can also be divided
into a different set of three: the three including those which lead to an
experience of pleasure and so on.
Our more detailed treatment of these points will proceed in two steps: first a
presentation of merit and the rest; secondly, a description of the mentioned
pleasure and so on.

50
Merit, Non-Merit, and Unshifting Deeds

,BSOD NAMS 'DOD KHAMS DGE BA'I LAS,
,MI G-YO GONG MA LAS SKYES PA'I,
,GANG PHYIR SA NI DE DAG TU,
,LAS RNAMS SMIN PHYIR MI G-YO'I PHYIR,
Merit, virtuous deeds of the realm of desire.
The ones that come from the above, unshifting.
They're unshifting for the reason that
The deeds involved ripen at their levels.
[IV.181-4]

'O NA, BSOD NAMS KYI LAS LA SOGS PA GANG ZHE NA, BSOD NAMS KYI LAS NI 'DOD KHAMS KYI DGE BA'I LAS DANG , MI G-YO BA'I LAS NI GONG MA GZUGS GZUGS MED LAS SKYES PA'I LAS YIN NO,
One might start with the following question: "Just how do you describe merit
and the other types of deeds you mentioned?" Deeds that we call "merit" are
the virtuous deeds of the realm of desire. What we call "unshifting" deeds
are the ones that come from those realms above; that is, from the form and
formless realms.

,GONG MA'I LAS DE MI G-YO BA YIN NA, BSAM GTAN GSUM PA MAN CHAD G-YO PAR BSHAD PA DANG 'GAL ZHE NA, MI 'GAL TE, BSAM GTAN GSUM PA MAN CHAD G-YO BAR BSHAD PA NI TING NGE 'DZIN GYI SKYON GYIS G-YO BA LA DGONGS, GONG MA'I LAS RNAM SMIN MI G-YO BA LA DGONGS PA'I PHYIR,
"Isn't it contradictory," one may object, "for you to describe deeds of the upper
realms as unshifting, when those of the third and lower levels of concentration
are explained as shifting types?" There is no contradiction. The levels of
concentration from the third on down are explained as "shifting" or "affected"

only with reference to their being affected by the various problems that prevent
one from perfecting single-pointed concentration. The point in calling deeds
of the upper realms "unshifting" is in reference, rather, to the fact that they do
not shift direction when they ripen.

RNAM SMIN MI G-YO BA YIN TE, GANG GI PHYIR NA GZUGS GZUGS MED KYIS NI DE DAG TU SMIN PAR 'GYUR PA'I LAS KYI RNAM SMIN SA GZHAN DU NAM YANG MI SMIN PA'I PHYIR NA RNAM SMIN GZHAN DU MI G-YO BA'I PHYIR,
These deeds are called "unshifting" for the reason that a ripening of deeds
which is meant to occur at "their" level--at the levels of the form and formless
realms--will never occur at any other level. The point is thus that the ripening
is an unshifting one.

Deeds of the desire realm, on the other hand, are shifting--someone meant to
be born as a pleasure being can, through the effect of certain factors, take birth
as one of the other types of beings. There was for example the case of the
Brahmin who because of his generosity was to be born as a pleasure being.
But he caught sight of an especially majestic elephant and thought to himself
how wonderful it would be if he could obtain one. As a result, he took birth
as the elephant known as Son of the Protector.

Next we consider deeds involving a sensation of pleasure and so on. We
proceed in three steps concerning (1) definitive examples of each of the deeds
leading to specific types of experiences, (2) the various divisions of experience,

and (3) the correlation between specific sensations and the deeds they result
from. Definitive examples are discussed in terms of both positions accepted
by the present school and those accepted by others.

,BDE BA MYONG 'GYUR DE YAN CHAD,
,SDUG MIN BDE MIN MYONG 'GYUR BA,

Virtue up to the third concentration, the ones that
Bring a pleasant experience. From here on up,
The ones which bring on neither pain nor pleasure.
Non-virtue here which bring a painful experience.
[IV.185-8]

"In the lines above," one might begin, "you mentioned `the three including
those which lead to pleasure.' Can you describe these types of deeds?"
Virtuous deeds from the desire realm up to the third concentration level are
the ones that bring one a pleasant experience in the future. From here--that
is, from this third concentration level--on up to the "peak" level, virtuous
deeds are the ones which bring on an experience of a neutral nature: neither
pain nor pleasure. The deeds which bring on a painful experience are all the
non-virtuous deeds here in the desire realm.

52
Other Views on Deeds that Lead
to Specific Experiences

,'OG NA'ANG BAR MA YOD DO ZHES,
,KHA CIG ZER TE GANG GI PHYIR,
,BSAM GTAN KHYAD PAR RNAM SMIN LAS,
,SNGA PHYI MED GSUM SMIN 'DOD PHYIR,
Some make the claim that the ones below as well

Now some people make the claim that the ones below the fourth
concentration level--that is, the third on down--have as well those deeds that
lead to the "one between": to a neutral experience. They say this is for the
reason that these are deeds that ripen in the advanced stages of the
concentration levels, and because we must accept it as possible for all three
types of results to ripen at the same time, without a temporal progression.

GNYIS PA LA, LNGAR DBYE BA, RNAM SMIN MYONG 'GYUR BYE BRAG TU BSHAD PA'O, , DANG PO NI,
Next we present the various divisions of experience. After discussing a
division into five different kinds, we will continue on to a more detailed
treatment of the ripening of past deeds into future experience.

Five Types of Experience

,NGO BO NYID DANG MTSUNGS LDAN DANG ,
,DMIGS PA DANG NI RNAM SMIN DANG ,
,MNGON SUM DU NI GYUR PA LAS,
,MYONG 'GYUR RNAM PA LNGA YIN NO,
Five are the different types of experience:
That by very nature, a mental link,
An object of focus, that by ripening,
That which makes its appearance in a manner direct.
[IV.193-6]

MYONG BAR 'GYUR BA'I LAS RNAM PA LNGA YOD PA YIN TE, TSOR BA LTA BU NGO BO NYID KYIS MYONG BAR 'GYUR BA DANG , REG PA LTA BU MTSUNGS LDAN GYIS MYONG BAR 'GYUR BA DANG , GZUGS LTA BU DMIGS PAS MYONG BAR 'GYUR BA DANG ,
Now there are five different types of experiences that deeds bring about. An
example of the first would be feelings, which are an experience or sensation by
their very nature. Something like the mental function of contact represents the
second type, or experience due to a mental link. And form for example is
experienced by acting as the object of one's focus.

DGE MI DGE'I LAS LTA BU RNAM SMIN GYIS MYONG BAR 'GYUR BA DANG , TSOR BA LTA BU MNGON SUM DU GYUR BA LAS MYONG BAR 'GYUR BA RNAMS SU YOD PA'I PHYIR,
Virtuous and non-virtuous deeds are cases where something is experienced by
its ripening. And an example of the final type, of something that one
experiences as it makes its appearance in a direct manner, would be feelings.
 GNYIS PA LA, SPYIR BSTAN, MYONG NGES BYE BRAG TU BSHAD PA'O, , DANG PO LA, LAS KYI DBYE BA, KHAMS DANG 'GRO BA GANG NA LAS 'PHEN PA DU YOD GNYIS, DANG PO NI,
Our more detailed treatment of experiences that ripen from a past deed will
begin with some general notes and continue to the particulars of deeds that
definitely lead to a future experience. The general notes themselves touch first
on the various divisions of deeds, then on the number of different deeds
projected with different realms and types of beings.

These are either definite or not;
The definite's three types because of those
Experienced as something seen and such.
Some claim that the kinds of deeds are five,
Others that the combinations are four.
Three of them act to project a discrete being.
[IV.197-202]

Now there are three types of deeds which lead to a future experience through
a process of ripening. These types of deeds themselves are grouped into two:

they are either definite, or not. The "definite" group is of three different
types, because it includes (1) those deeds with results that are experienced as
"something seen"--that is, deeds which ripen into an experience in this very
life; (2) deeds with results that are experienced after one's rebirth--that is, in
the very next life; and (3) deeds with results that are experienced in "some
other" life--which is to say, in any life after the next.

KHA CIG LAS RNAM PA LNGA ZHES ZER TE, MA NGES PA'I LAS LA RNAM SMIN NGES LA GNAS SKABS MA NGES PA DANG , DE GNYIS KA MA NGES PA GNYIS SU PHYE BAS SO,
Some people claim that the kinds of deeds are five: they arrive at this figure
by dividing indefinite types of deeds into (1) those which will definitely ripen
but at an indefinite time, and (2) those where neither ripening itself nor its
timing is definite.

Others--namely, the Exemplist group in the Sutrist school--claim that the
possible combinations which hold true in this regard are four. They say there
are (1) deeds which are definite to ripen but at no definite time, (2) deeds
which should ripen at a definite time but which are not definite to ripen at all,
(3) deeds which are definite in both respects, and (4) deeds which are definite
in neither respect.

One may ask which of these deeds projects a discrete being in the future.
Three of them act to project a discrete being, but deeds with results that you
see in this very life do not. This is because they ripen upon the very same
stream of heaps which performed the original deed.
Next we examine the number of different deeds that can be projected with
different realms and types of beings.

One may ask which different deeds can be projected with different realms and
beings. Every one of the five different types of beings each has all four kinds
of projections produced by deeds. In the hells through there are only three
projections of virtuous types of deeds that are possible. Here there can be no
projection of a virtuous deed that will bring one a result that he sees in the
very same life, because it is impossible for any deed to ripen into a pleasant
result in the hells.

Next let's consider a child [non-Arya] who is stable and has overcome his
desire for any one or number of the eight different levels. He does no deeds
of the type that will lead to an experience there after being reborn at a level
for which he has overcome desire. For the fact is that for his next life he will
not take any rebirth at a level for which he's lost desire.

Next let's consider a realized being who is stable and has overcome desire for
any one or number of the seven levels between. Neither does he perform any
deed which will lead to an experience at such a level after being reborn there;
what's more, he does not even perform any deed which will lead to an
experience at such a level in any other life beyond the next. This is because
he will never again take a birth at a level for which he has overcome desire.

Let's finally consider a realized being who has overcome his desire for the
desire realm and the "peak" level, but who is unstable. Neither does he ever
perform any deed which will lead to an experience subsequent to a rebirth, for
either his next life or for any life beyond, in the desire realm or "peak" level.
A realized being who has degenerated from the state of having overcome
desire for the desire realm and "peak" level is someone that we say has "lost

his result." But it is impossible for such a person to die during the period
between losing his result and gaining it back again.

One may ask whether deeds project their energy with beings of the state
between death and rebirth as well. There are twenty-two different projections
had with inbetween beings in the realm of desire. These are the inbetween
being himself, the five periods in the womb, and the five periods out of the
womb: these eleven are then divided into two types each, those which will
definitely be experienced and those that will not.

PHYIR, GNYIS PA NI,
The one group of eleven which are definite is considered to come from the
type of deeds that come with results that you see in the same life. This is
because "it"--this group--is counted but a single discrete being: the heaps that
were present when the energy of the deeds was collected, and the heaps that
are present when this energy ripens into an experience, have both been sent
forth by the same projecting energy born from deeds of the past.
Next we consider the particulars of deeds that definitely lead to a future
experience.

"Just what," one may ask, "do you mean when you mention types of deeds that
are certain to ripen?" Those deeds are definite (will definitely ripen into a
future experience) which involve any of the following:
1) fierce emotions, of either mental affliction or faith;
2) an object of special qualities--that is, deeds performed with
respect to the Gems;
3) anything done on a continual basis; and
4) killing one's father or mother, even when this is done with
meritorious intent.

"In the lines above," one may continue, "you mentioned that `one is the type
with results that you see.' Can you describe this further?" Deeds with results
which are something seen in the same life are this way due to special features
of the object or thought involved.

A case of a deed which, because of the special features of the object involved,
turned into the type that gives a result in the very same life would be as
follows. In one of his former lives, our Teacher was once a certain monk who
had mastered all three sections of the canon. There had been a steady increase
in quarreling among the community of monks. One monk--who had himself
committed the sections of the canon to memory--managed to bring the
different sides to an agreement. This angered the other monk (the one who
was a master of the canon), who made the sarcastic statement that "A woman
has settled a women's quarrel." Because of this deed the monk turned into a
woman in that very life, and took five hundred births thereafter as a woman
as well.

An instance of a deed which, because of special features of the thought
involved, turns into the type that gives a result that you see in this very life
would be as follows. King Kanaka had a certain eunuch by the name of
"Longwa." He met someone driving a herd of five hundred cattle and asked
the man what he planned to do. "We're going to castrate them," was the reply.
Overcome with compassion, Longwa managed to save all the cattle from their
fate: as a result, his own organ was restored in the very same life.

particular level can also constitute a deed which gives a result that you see in
the very same life, in cases where the person has become completely free of
any desire for this level.

Help or harm to any of the following
Leads to quick experience of a result:
Anyone coming out of cessation or love,
No affliction, seeing, result of destroying.
[IV.221-4]

One may ask about the features that make an object special. Help or harm
which you perform towards anyone who has just come out of cessation leads
to a quick experience of a result, for it is almost as if such a person has just
come back from nirvana. Help and harm too towards anyone who has just
come out of a meditation on immeasurable love or a state of one-pointed
concentration where he has no affliction at all also leads to the speedy
experience of a result. This is because such persons are helping every living
being; they are involved with a willingness to accept the ultimate personal
responsibility, free of any affliction; and they are totally imbued with an
immeasurable kind of merit, very sharp and clear.

Help or harm done towards a person who has just come out of the path of
seeing is another example of a deed that leads to a quick result. This is true
because this person has just attained, for the first time, an unstained state
where he has gotten rid of every undesirable object eliminated by the path of
seeing.

Finally, beneficial or harmful acts towards a person who has just come out of
the state where he achieved the result of destroying the enemy also lead to the
quick experience of a result. The reason here is that the person has just
achieved, for the first time, the unstained state where he has gotten rid of
every undesirable object eliminated by the path of habituation.

Help or harm performed towards those who have just come out of a state
where they have achieved one of the two results--where they need either
return or not return to the realm of desire--does not though lead to a speedy
result. First of all, their "new" condition of having reached an unstained state
free of the objects eliminated by the path of seeing has by this time become
somewhat old. Secondly, they have yet to reach the unstained state where they
have just managed, for the first time, to rid themselves of the objects stopped
by the path of habituation.

We turn now to the third and final step in our discussion of deeds involving
a sensation of pleasure and so on. This is a presentation of the correlation
between specific sensations and the deeds from which they result. Following
the actual presentation we will go into some detail on the subject of mental
illness.

RJES TZONG KHA PA CHEN POS BRTZOMS PA'I LAM RIM CHEN MO LAS,
The following selection is from the Great Book on the Steps of the Path, composed
by Lord Tsongkapa (1357-1419):

GSUM PA DE DAG GI 'BRAS BU LA GSUM LAS, RNAM SMIN GYI 'BRAS BU NI,
Here is the third section, a presentation on the consequences of the various
kinds of bad deeds. We proceed in three parts, beginning with what are called
the "ripened" consequences.

LAS LAM BCU PO RE RE YANG GZHI DUG GSUM CHUNG 'BRING CHE GSUM LA BRTEN PAS GSUM GSUM MO, , DE LA SROG GCOD SOGS CHEN PO BCU PO RE RES DMYAL BA, 'BRING BCU PO RE RES YI DVAGS DANG , CHUNG NGU BCU PO RE RES DUD 'GROR SKYE BAR SA'I DNGOS GZHIR GSUNGS LA,
Now each one of the ten paths of karma can itself be divided into three
kinds--lesser, medium, and greater--depending on the intensity of the three
poisons. The Main Stage of Levels states that, from the ten greater instances of
killing and the rest, one is born into the hells. It says that from medium
instances of each of the ten you take birth as an insatiable spirit; and from the
ten lesser instances, you are born as an animal.

SA BCU PA'I MDO LAS NI CHUNG 'BRING GNYIS KYI 'BRAS BU LDOG STE GSUNGS SO,
The Sutra on the Ten Levels however states the consequences of two of the kinds
of instances, the lesser and the medium, in reverse of this.

The "consistent" consequences are as follows. Even if you do manage to escape
the realms of misery and take birth as a human, the following respective
results occur to you:
1) Your life is short.
2) You don't have enough to live on.
3) You have problems keeping your partner from others.
4) People don't believe what you say, even when you're telling the
truth.
5) You lose friends easily.
6) You hear things as bad sounds.
7) No one listens to you.
8) Your personality is dominated by desire.
9) Your personality is dominated by anger.
10) Your personality is dominated by stupidity.

The Chapter on the True and the Sutra on the Ten Levels state that there are two
such consequences for each of the ones given here; even if you do manage to
take birth as a human,
1) Your life is short, and you get sick easily.
2) You don't have enough to live on, and what you do have is all
just common property with others.
3) The people who work around you are "inconsistent," which here
means unreliable, and you find yourself having a lot of
competition for your partner.
4) No one believes what you say, even when you are speaking the
truth, and others are always deceiving you.
5) The people around you are always fighting against one another,
and have an undesirable character.
6) You hear many unpleasant things, and when others talk to you
it always seems to you as if they want to start a fight.
7) No one respects what you say--no one thinks that what you say
has any particular value, and you are afflicted with a lack of
confidence.
8) Your personality is dominated by desire, and you are never
satisfied with what you have.
9) You are always finding yourself without help, or never find the
help you need; and you are always hurting others, or always
being hurt by others.
10) You become a person who keeps harmful views, or a deceitful
person.

Great lamas of the past have expressed the position that it is a consequence of
consistent action where as a karmic result of killing you become someone who
takes pleasure in killing and the rest. It is a consequence of consistent
experience then when you have to undergo the results just listed.

Next is what we call the "environmental" or "dominant" consequence. Here for
example the consequence of killing expresses itself in the outer world around
you. Food, drink, medicine, the crops in the fields, and other such things have
very little power; they are always inferior; they have little nutrition or potency;
they are hard to digest, and they cause disease in you. Because of this the
majority of the living beings around you die before reaching the end of a full
life.

Because you have lied, you live in a world where, when you undertake
farming or some work in cooperation with other people, in the end the work

everyone is cheating one another, and is afraid, and where there are many

they start to grow at the wrong times, never at the right times, and seem ripe

are actually nice, and happiness; a world where there is no place to go, no one
to help, nothing to protect you.

Course V: How Karma Works
Reading Five: How Karma is Carried, According to the Mind-
Only School
Selection One: The Mind-Only School on how mental seeds cause our
perceptions

RJE TZONG KHA PA CHEN POS BRTZOMS PA'I DBU MA DGONGS PA RAB GSAL LAS,
The selections are all taken from Illumination of the True Thought, written by
Lord Tsongkapa:

,GNYIS PA LA GNYIS, GZHAN GYI LUGS BRJOD PA DANG , LUGS DE DGAG PA'O, , DANG PO NI, DE SKAD BSTAN PA YIN DANG SLAR YANG SEMS TZAM PAS RANG GI LUGS BRJOD PA GTZO BOR BYAS PA NYID KYIS RANG GI 'DOD DON 'GRUB PAR BSAMS SHING SMRAS PA,
. . .The second part has two sections of its own: stating the position of the other
school, and then denying this position. Here is the first.
This is how the presentation was made. Then those of the Mind-Only School
come back, considering and then presenting a position which by itself reflects
the primary belief of their entire system.

MIG GI BLO STE RNAM PAR SHES PA SKYE BA'I RANG GI NUS PA BAG CHAGS GANG ZHIG KUN GZHI LA, RNAM SHES GZHAN GYIS RANG 'GAG BZHIN PA NA, DE MA THAG TU 'JOG PAR BYED LA,

They speak first of the mental seed, the energy, from which the "mind of the
eye" (which refers to the consciousness of the eye) comes forth. Another case
of consciousness, as it is in the process of stopping, in the next moment plants
this mental seed in the foundation consciousness. When this seed ripens later,
it produces that consciousness of the eye, one which takes after the earlier one.
 RANG GI STE MIG GI RNAM SHES DE NUS PA'I SKAD CIG BAR MED PA GANG ZHIG LAS SKYE BA'I NUS PA'I SKAD CIG PAR MED PA RTEN DU GYUR PA DE LA, GTI MUG GIS 'JIG RTEN RNAMS DBANG PO GZUGS CAN MIG YIN NO SNYAM DU RTOGS KYI, RNAM SHES LAS THA DAD PA'I MIG DBANG NI YOD PA MIN NO, , DE BZHIN DU DBANG PO GZUGS CAN LHAG MA LA YANG SBYAR BAR BYA'O,
Consider now this energy as it exists immediately before producing the
consciousness of the eye related to it; consider the energy which acts as the
immediate basis for this eye consciousness. Normal people, out of ignorance,
conceive of this as the physical faculty of the eye. In truth though a power of
the eye which is something separate from consciousness is something that
doesn't even exist. This same explanation applies to all the remaining physical
faculties.

,DE LA MIG SHES SKYE BA'I RGYU BAG CHAGS NI DE'I RGYU'I RKYEN YIN LA, MIG GI DBANG PO NI MIG SHES KYI BDAG PO'I RKYEN NO,
Here the cause behind the consciousness of the eye, the mental seed, is the
primary factor behind it. The faculty of the eye is the component of the body
that provides a contributing circumstance.

,'DIR MIG DBANG MIG SHES KYI DNGOS RGYUR BSTAN PA NI, MIG SHES SKYE BA'I BAG CHAGS SMIN PA'I SKABS LA DGONGS KYI MIG DBANG GANG YIN LA MIN NO,
Here when the physical faculty of the eye is presented as the direct cause of
the consciousness of the eye, the real intent is to refer to the situation where
the mental seed which produces the eye consciousness is ripening. They are
not talking here of what we normally think of as the physical faculty of the
eye.

Regarding this the text called Middle and Extremes states,
The combination of the objects
and the person,
The base consciousness, is a consciousness
that appears;
In reality this is not the being.
Here the word "objects" refers to form and the rest, and "the person" refers to
the five faculties; the lines are describing a consciousness that arises and which
appears to be them, but which is actually foundation consciousness. Master
Stiramati also explains the physical faculties as the object of foundation
consciousness. The point then is that those of the Mind-Only School who
accept the idea of a foundation consciousness believe that the physical faculties
of the eye and so on are actually the condition of the foundation consciousness
appearing as the physical faculties.

,RNAM SHES LAS THA DAD PA'I MIG DBANG SOGS MED PAR BSTAN NAS, GZUGS KYANG RNAM PAR SHES PA LAS DON GZHAN PA MED PAR BSTAN PA'I PHYIR SMRAS PA, 'JIG RTEN 'DI NA DBANG PO LNGA LAS BYUNG BA'I RNAM PAR RIG PA LNGA, SNGON PO LA SOGS PA'I PHYI ROL

Once they have demonstrated that there is no such thing as physical faculties
of the eye and so on that could ever be anything separate from consciousness
itself, then they must show how form as well is nothing other than
consciousness. To do this they give the following description. Consider now
the five types of consciousness that, according to general belief, arise from the
five physical faculties. It is not that there are any outside physical objects such
as the color blue and so on which the consciousness has to grasp to. Rather,
blue and the rest are only an appearance which occurs through the ripening
of the very mental seed which was planted in the foundation consciousness
and from which consciousness itself has arisen. Not realizing this fact, people
look at the mind appearing as blue or whatever and accept or interpret these
appearances as being outer objects.

Selection Two: How the Middle-Way School says the mental seeds of
karma work

,GNYIS PA NI, GAL TE KUN GZHI RNAM SHES KHAS MI LEN KYANG DGE MI DGE'I BAG CHAGS 'JOG PA DANG , BAG CHAGS DE SMIN PA LAS 'BRAS BU 'BYUNG BAR 'DOD DGOS TE, 'JUG 'GREL LAS, THOG MA MED PA'I 'KHOR BAR DNGOS PO'I BAG CHAGS BZHAG PA YONGS SU SMIN PA, DNGOS PO LA MNGON PAR ZHEN PA, ZHES DANG , DE 'DRA BA GZHAN YANG MANG DU 'BYUNG BA'I PHYIR RO, , DE YANG BAG CHAGS 'JOG PA'I GZHI MED PAR MI RUNG BAS GZHI DE GANG YIN ZHE NA,
Here is the second part [of a different] discussion [about where the
Madhyamika school believes the mental seeds from karma are planted, since
they do not accept the concept of foundation consciousness]. One may begin
with the following question:

Suppose you deny then the existence of a foundation
consciousness. Nonetheless you must accept that
mental seeds from virtue or non-virtue do get planted,
and that consequences do arise from the ripening of
these mental seeds. After all, the autocommentary to
Entering the Middle Way does state that "For time
without beginning, in the suffering cycle of life, the
mental seeds for things have been planted, and have
then ripened, and have then been interpreted by
people as the things themselves." There are as well
many other quotations which mention the same thing.
And it would be incorrect to say that there existed no
basis or place where these mental seeds were planted.
What then, according to your view, provides this place
for the seeds to be planted?

JI LTAR KUN GZHI RNAM SHES KHAS LEN PA RNAMS KYI LTAR NA, NYON YID KYIS NGA'O SNYAM DU DMIGS PA'I GZHIR GYUR PA'I KUN GZHI RNAM SHES BAG CHAGS KYI GNAS SU 'DOD PA DE BZHIN DU LUGS 'DIS KYANG NGA'O SNYAM PA TZAM GYI BLO LHAN SKYES KYI DMIGS PA DE NYID BAG CHAGS SGO BA'I GZHIR BZHED DO,
According to those who accept the idea of a foundation consciousness, the
thing called "afflicted mind" focuses on foundation consciousness and holds it
to be "me"; they say that this foundation consciousness then is the place where
the mental seeds stay. In our [Madhyamika] school too we have a similar
concept; we say that the base which is stained with the mental seed is exactly
that thing that you focus on with your simple, natural awareness of yourself
and call "me."

One may ask the following:

The autocommentary to Entering the Middle Way states
that the stream of the mind is the basis where the
mental seeds are planted. How does this fit into what
you have just said?
The very thing we call the simple "me" is something which results from a label
being applied to the mind, or consciousness. It also goes on in a stream. From
this point of view then we can also refer to it as the "stream of the mind." And
even if what you mean by a "stream" is the continuation of later, similar
instances of mind itself, you can say that it too is the basis which is stained by
mental seeds of particular occasions.

Here is how the mental seed for ignorance works. The autocommentary to
Entering the Middle Way says,
That thing which tends to stop, and yet still stain, and
then continue on in the flow of the mind is what we
refer to as a 'mental seed.' The expressions 'continuity'
and 'habit' and 'root' and 'mental seed' for the state of
mental affliction all refer to the same thing. This is
something that Listeners and Self-Made "Buddhas" are
unable to eliminate even though they may already
have eliminated the state of mental affliction itself
through using the unstained path. It's similar to what

happens with sesame butter or flowers; you may
already remove these things from the scene, but the
vase in which the flowers were, or the piece of cloth
that the butter stained, still retain some subtle trace of
them due to the previous contact.
How then could there be any sense to saying that there is another basis, a
second one, on top of the one mentioned here, where other types of mental
seeds, like those of virtuous deeds and non-virtuous deeds and the rest, are
planted?

One might wonder about something else:
Let's talk about the period while you are in the
"uninterrupted" stage of the path of seeing [the actual
direct perception of emptiness]. I can accept that at
this point the negative thoughts eliminated by this
path are no longer present, but we would have to say
that the negative things eliminated by the path of
habituation are still there, in a dormant way. At this
particular point in time, the consciousness of the mind
is unstained, unaffected by the mental seed which
causes the mistaken state of mind where the
appearance and actuality of things are different from
one another. As such none of these things could lie
dormant here, due to its very quality at the time.
There is no consciousness of the senses that could act
as the basis for those mental seeds, and it would be
improper to say that physical form could ever provide

such a basis either. According to you, moreover,
there's no foundation consciousness. I would have to
think then that there is no basis at all where these
dormant things could stay.
And yet there is no such problem, for at this point in time it is the simple "me"
which is providing the basis for the dormant things eliminated by the path of
habituation to stay. You can apply this reasoning as well to all the other cases
involving things to be eliminated, and the antidotes which eliminate them.

Selection Three: The Middle-Way School on the question of where the
seeds of karma stay until they give their result

Here is the second point [of still another discussion]. One may ask the
following:
Those who believe that entities have no natural existence [meaning
the Madhyamika Prasangika (or Consequence) School] do not
accept the concepts of a foundation consciousness and the like;
how then is it that they can still assert that all the workings of
karma and its consequences are totally right and proper?

All the Buddhist schools, whether higher schools or lower schools, accept the
principle that the consequences of pleasure and pain and so on arise from

virtuous and non-virtuous karma or actions, even though the original karma
and its eventual consequences may be separated by a very long period of time.
The problem though is that, if the karma stays around during the entire period
up to the point at which it gives its consequence, it would have to be
unchanging. An unchanging thing though is incapable of affecting anything,
and so you could never have a relationship where karma gave rise to any
consequence.

,LAS DE BYAS PA'I SKAD CIG GNYIS PAR ZHIG NA NI, MTSAMS DE NAS 'BRAS BU DNGOS SU 'BYIN PA'I SNGA LOGS KYI BAR DU LAS DE MED LA, LAS ZHIG PA YANG DNGOS POR MED PAS LAS LAS 'BRAS BU JI LTAR 'BYUNG BAR 'GYUR ZHES BRTZAD PA'I LAN DU,
From the moment after you complete a karma or deed, that deed is finished
and gone. During the entire period from that point up to the point at which
the consequence actually occurs, the deed no longer exists. A deed which is
already gone is no longer a thing that can have any affect on anything. How
then does a deed or karma ever produce any kind of consequence? Here is
how we explain this problem:

LAS BYAS PA'I SKAD CIG GNYIS PAR 'GAGS ZIN PA'I SNGA LOGS KYI LAS 'GAG PA LA MNGON DU PHYOGS PA'I TSE, LAS KYI NUS PA GZHAG PAR BYA BA'I PHYIR KHA CIG KUN GZHI RNAM PAR SHES PA RTOG PAR BYED LA, KHA CIG BU LON GYI DPANG RGYA STE DE'I YI GE DANG 'DRA BA'I LAS GNYIS LAS DON GZHAN PA, CHUD MI ZA BA ZHES PA LDAN MIN 'DU BYED DU GYUR PA CIG 'DOD DO, , KHA CIG NI LAS GNYIS KYI THOB PA ZHES PA DE GNYIS LAS DON GZHAN DU GYUR PA'I LDAN MIN ZHIG RTOG PAR BYED DO,
Let's consider the deed or karma as it exists up to the point right after the
moment in which the deed is completed; that is, let's consider the deed as it
approaches its end. The energy of the deed has to be stored somewhere, and
so some thinkers have invented the idea of some kind of foundation
consciousness for it to stay. Others have said that there is something which is
changing but neither mental nor physical, something they call "the fact of not
just going away"; they say it is something that exists separately from the two
types of deeds [virtue and non-virtue], and that it resembles the document

written up for a loan that has to be repaid. Still others have invented the idea
that there is another changing thing which is neither mental nor physical, again
different from the two kinds of deeds themselves, something they call a "hold."

Others finally have invented the idea of a stream of consciousness which is
stained with the mental seed of the deed. This then is why, they say, that it
is no contradiction for the deed to produce its consequence later, even after a
very long time. The deed or karma plants a mental seed in the foundation
consciousness, and so the mental seed is the result of the deed. This mental
seed continues on in a stream of similar forms until eventually it produces the
consequence. Thus, they say, the consequence of the original karma is
something that is produced indirectly, via a medium. This same type of idea
applies to the other three positions expressed.

The first of these positions belongs to a certain group within the Mind-Only
School. The second position is explained by Master Avalokitavrata to be that
of the Detailist School--of a certain section other than the Kashmiri Detailists.
The third position also belongs to a specific group within the Detailist School.
It is not completely clear where the fourth position belongs, but since it is

consistent with the ninth chapter of the autocommentary to the Treasure House
of Knowledge (Abhidharmakosha), it would appear to be an alternate belief of the
Sutrists and the Kashmiri Detailists.

Although the Kashmiris do accept the idea of a "hold," they do not assert that
a hold could be produced by the two types of karma as something retained by
the hold. The position here though belongs to someone who does assert this,
and this is the point of the phrase "according to someone."
According to someone now of the Madhyamika Consequence school, the deed
or karma is not something which arises in and of itself, and so, for this very
reason, neither is it something which finishes through any nature of its own.
Nonetheless it is no contradiction to say that something which never finishes
through any nature of its own can still produce a consequence. As such a
consequence can come from a deed even if we never accept the idea of a
foundation consciousness or the like.
You must understand then that this is why the two kinds of karma can already
have finished in the mental continuum of any given sentient being, and yet still
after a long time--even after the passing of many millions of years--these
deeds can nonetheless produce their consequences "perfectly," which is to say,

without any confusion. [That is, good deeds lead to pleasure, and bad deeds
lead to pain, and there is never any case where this law somehow goes wrong,
and good deeds lead to pain, or bad deeds to pleasure.]
Given all this, the connection between deeds and their consequences is, in this
school, purely and totally correct.

The point of all this is that all four of the positions above, as they attempt to
answer the problem raised, do so from a viewpoint of accepting that a deed
has a beginning that exists by definition and an ending too that exists by
definition. They are agreeing as well that the later condition of the deed's
having ended is something that exists by definition. The Master [Chandrakirti]
is stating that it is improper to answer the problem raised above by saying
that, "Even though the ending of the deed is that way, it's no problem, because
we believe in foundation consciousness." He is denying all these positions, for
the reason that there simply doesn't even exist any beginning or ending of a
deed that could occur through any nature of its own.

The Master, to demonstrate how this way of answering reflects exactly the
position of the Arya [Nagarjuna], quotes the following statement from the Root
Text on Wisdom:
Because the karma never begins,
Because it has no nature of its own,
And since it has never even begun,
Neither then can it simply go away.
The lines are saying that, because there is no such thing as a karma that exists
through its own nature, no such karma could ever have a beginning that came
in and of itself. Because of this, it is completely impossible for a karma ever
to end by any nature of its own. It is illogical to think of the subsequent
condition of the deed's having ended and invent some idea of something that
can never just go away.

Selection Four: What the Middle-Way School means when it says things
are just the results of conceptualization

This section [still another one] has two parts to it. First we will show how it
is that objects are established through the process of conceptualization, and
then describe what it is to grasp to true existence, wherein one holds things as
existing in the opposite way. Here is the first.

The Sutra Requested by Upali includes the following lines:
A splash of pleasing flowers open their petals,
Golden palaces blaze in breathtaking beauty;
Look for their maker, but you'll never find him,
For all of these are built of conceptions--
The world is an invention of conceptions.
The verse is describing how objects are established through the process of
conceptualization, and there are as well many other statements of the Buddha
that describe how every single object in the universe is nothing more than a
creation of conceptions.

The Sixty Verses on Reasoning say as well,
The world is something that ignorance causes;
Why? For the Buddhas say it is so.
And why then would it be wrong to say
That this world is only conceptions.
The meaning of this verse, according to the commentary, is that none of the
many worlds that exist does so through some essence of its own: none of them
are anything more than products of our conception.

The 400 Verses says as well:
Without conceptions, desire and such
Are nothing that can even exist;
Why then would anyone with a brain
Believe in reality and conception?
The commentary to the work states that--
Things that can't even exist in the absence of
conceptions are, beyond any manner of doubt,
absolutely things that cannot exist through any
essence of their own: they are like a coil of rope you
label with "snake."
The expression "reality" here refers to something that could exist through its
own essence. "Conception" is the fact that things occur through the process of
conceptualization.

When this commentary states that "desire and such" are like a piece of rope
labelled "snake," it is only giving a single example; what it means to say is that
each and every other existing object is as well like a rope called a snake: they
are all established through the process of conceptualization.
Here the colored pattern of the rope and the way it's coiled make it resemble
a snake; and if you're in a place where you can't see it very clearly, then you
start to think to yourself, "It's a snake!" The fact though is that there is nothing
about the rope as a whole, nor anything about its various parts, that you could

ever establish as being one kind of a snake; the snake of the rope, then, is
nothing but a creation of conceptions.

The same thing happens when you get the idea of "me" about the heaps, the
various components to yourself. There is nothing about these components as
a whole, when you consider them as a continuum in time, nor as a whole
considered in a single moment in time, nor as the various parts to a whole, that
you could ever establish as being any kind of "me." We'll go into this in more
detail further on.

Because of this fact, and since moreover there is not the slightest thing outside
of the parts or whole of the components to yourself that you could ever
consider any kind of "me," this "me" is nothing more than a creation of
conception, based on the components. There is no "me" which exists through
any essence of its own.

Now the Sixty Verses on Reasoning says,
The world is something that ignorance causes;
Why? For the Buddhas say it is so.
And why then would it be wrong to say
That this world is only conceptions.
If one were to end his ignorance,
Then how is it that the thing that's ended,
Despite our misunderstanding, could never
Disappear, even in conceptions?

The meaning of the lines is as follows. If things existed in their very essence,
then they would exist as some independent reality. If this were so, then when
you finally stopped your mistaken states of mind, they would never disappear,
although they should have.

The mind is the main thing; and to show this, the following explanation
appears in the scripture:
The world, in the form of those who live in it, finds its
very being through the power of the karma they have
collected with their minds, and through the bad
thoughts in their minds. All the vast multitude of
worlds too, in the form of the places where these
beings live, have been put there, have been produced,
by the collective karma of these same beings, and no

one else--by the karma within their own minds. This
refers to everything up to the farthest reaches of the
world, from the great disc of wind that underpins our
planet up to the highest temporary heaven, the one
named "Below No Other."

On this subject, the intricate patterns on a peacock and
other such objects are produced by each one's personal
karma. The intricacies of the petals and colors of a
lotus flower and other such things are produced by
the collective karma of living beings. You can apply
these principles to all other cases as well.

As the verse goes,
It's through the karma of living beings
That the great dark mountains arise in their time.
It's like the hells, and the heavens above,
And swords, and jewels, and trees in the world.
The great books of the Mind-Only School also discuss whether the two worlds
[of beings and the place they live] are produced by karma that is collective or
not, and so it's not as though the system of the Mind Only denies the existence
of the world where beings live.

And so it is spoken, that all the living beings of the universe are produced by
karma. And if somehow you could stop all minds, then karma itself would
cease to be, for it is only through mind and what comes along with it that
karma can be collected. Therefore karma itself depends on the mind. So the
statement from the Sutra of the Ten Levels, where it says that there is no great
master of all things, and no great maker of all things, conveys one meaning of
the word "only" in the expression "mind-only"; the point is that there is no
other creator of things than the mind itself.

It is stated in scripture as well that each and every one of the twelve links in
the chain of interdependence depends on a single thing: the mind. These
references convey yet another meaning of the word "only" in the expression
"mind-only." Here the point is that mind is the main thing. The former
scriptural references are putting their point in a negative way, and the latter
references are putting their point in a positive way.

Thus we can see that it's the mind which is the one single principal cause that
sets all life into motion. The principal cause is not something other than the
mind. Therefore when the sutras speak of "mind only," they are making the
point that mind is the main thing, and not matter. Although we do of course
admit that physical matter exists, this matter is not the one prime creator of
sentient beings in the way that mind is.
Therefore all these scriptural references are denying that the opposite of the
mind, something other than the mind, could be the creator. They are not
though saying that there are no outside physical objects at all.

The following selections are from the Overview of the Middle Way, composed by
Master Kedrup Tenpa Dargye (1493-1568).

Let us first consider enemy destroyers of the Listener or Self-Made Buddha
type. Aren't you saying then that, like the non-Buddhists, they fail to eliminate
all the widespread mental afflictions that operate in all three realms? Because
isn't it true that they have failed to achieve the path which is directly
incompatible, in the way it holds its object, with the root of all these afflictions;
that is, the tendency to conceive of things as existing through some nature of
their own? And this is true, for they lack that comprehensive knowledge
where they realize that things have no nature of their own.

Consider these same enemy destroyers. It is true that they have not yet
realized, entirely, the fact that the person has no self nature. This is because
they have yet to perceive directly the fact that the person has no nature. This
in itself is true as well, for they are still chained by total misperceptions, in
such a way that they will never be able to root out the object that they think
they see when they hold the parts to the person, the thing which gets the label
of "me," as existing from its own side. And this too is true, for they lack that
comprehensive knowledge where they realize that the parts to the person have
no nature of their own.

The first of our logical statements above is always true. For suppose that a
person is still unable to root out the object that he thinks he sees when he
holds the parts to the person, the thing which gets the label of "me," as existing
through some nature of its own. As long as he goes on this way, then he will
continue to find himself unable to root out the object that he thinks he sees
when he holds the thing which gets the label, the "me," as existing from its
own side. And as long as he continues with this, then by the power of this
misperception he will continue to collect karma. And as long as he collects
karma, then he will continue to spin around in this wheel of suffering life.

This then is the ultimate idea within the root text and the commentary of the
Higher Line, [written by Maitreya and Asanga]:
Due to the mental seeds for the two kinds of tendencies to grasp to some self-
nature, these two tendencies themselves spring up.
Due to the fact that they have sprung up, an impression with a wrong way of
looking at things springs up, and some things seem as though they are
pleasant from their own side, and other things seem as though they are
unpleasant from their own side.
Due to the fact that this impression has sprung up, the emotion of liking
springs up, where you focus on a pleasant object and don't want to lose it.
And the emotion of disliking springs up, where you focus on an unpleasant
object and want to avoid it.
This then forces you to collect karma.
And karma forces you to spin around in the wheel of suffering life.
And this is why the Buddhas have said that this suffering life is something
forced on us because we have not been able to see, directly, the essence of the
Ones Gone Thus [that is, emptiness].

Here we will analyze the statement [from Entering the Middle Way, by Master
Chandrakirti (650 AD)] where it says, "...The mind of a craving spirit as well,
which sees a stream of water as pus." One may begin with the following
question:
Let's consider the objects of the following states of
mind: the visual consciousness of a craving spirit
where a river of water looks like pus and blood; the
visual consciousness of a person with a kind of
cataract where a clean white porcelain basin looks like
a hair has fallen into it; and that kind of meditation
where you visualize skeletons--where you imagine
that the entire surface of the earth is covered with the
bones of corpses. Are all these objects completely
equivalent, as far as being something that exists or
doesn't exist?

In reply we will first set forth a relevant passage, and then we will explicate
the passage. Here is the first. The text called The Abbreviation of the Greater
Way says,
Insofar as craving spirits, animals,
Humans, and pleasure beings, each according
To their class, have differing perceptions
Of a single thing, we say it has no reality.
Asvabhava, the venered layman with lifetime vows, has explained the passage.
His words include the following:

CHU KLUNG GI DNGOS PO GCIG LA RANG RANG GI LAS KYI RNAM SMIN GYI DBANG GIS YI DVAGS KYIS RNAG KHRAG LA SOGS PAS GANG BAR MTHONG BA DANG ,
When they look at a single thing, a stream of water, each one sees
what the ripening of his particular karma forces him to see. A
craving spirit sees the river full of pus and blood and the like.

to conceptualize physical matter has dissolved
altogether.

Here secondly we will explain the meaning of the text we quoted first. We
proceed in three steps: disproving the position of others, establishing our own
position, and then refuting their rebuttal. Here is the first.

Someone may make the following claim:
Given the statements that have come above, the fact is
that we should never again consider anything as being
one way or the other.
Well then, you must be suggesting that the system of the Buddha is all the
same as the system of every non-Buddhist belief, that there is no difference in
their correctness at all. And you must be saying too that we could never state
that our Teacher was the highest teacher, and that the teachers of the non-
Buddhists are lesser.

And you must be suggesting all this, for you have claimed that we should
never again consider anything as being one way or the other.
Now if you should agree that none of the differences mentioned above exist,
we must reply that they do, for as the verse says:
All other teachers now I've given up,
And go for refuge now to only You;
Why? Because it's You alone who has
No fault, and perfected every good.

Someone else might make the following claim:
Suppose a pleasure being, a human, and a craving
spirit sit down together and look at a glass filled with
water: the thing that we define as "wet and flowing."
Since to the perceptions of each different type of being
it is real, the glass full of wet and flowing water is in
reality pus and blood to the eyes of the craving spirit,
and in reality water to the eyes of the human, and in
reality ambrosia to the eyes of the pleasure being.

We ask you then a question: in the situation you've just described, is it that the
visual consciousness of all three beings are a valid perception, or is it that only
one or two of them are a valid perception? Suppose you say all three are
valid. Well then, the glass of wet and flowing water must be full of something
that is all three different things: pus and blood, and each of the others. And
then too it must be possible for there to be multiple and yet still valid
perceptions which see one thing in two completely incompatible ways. And
finally there must be such a thing as a valid perception which correctly
perceives that the glass is filled with something which is simultaneously water
and yet not water. Why so? Because, according to your view, the three

differing cases of visual consciousness possessed by the three different beings
would all have to be valid perception.

And if you try to agree to these absurdities, you are wrong, for the quality of
being pus and blood is incompatible with the quality of being either one of the
other two substances mentioned. Moreover, the quality of being water and the
quality of not being water are directly incompatible in such a way that, if
something exists and lacks one of these qualities, it must then possess the
other.

Someone may answer with the following claim:
In the case mentioned, the visual consciousness of the
human is a valid perception, but the visual
consciousnesses of the other two types of beings are
not valid perception. These latter two see something
like the pus and blood, and the ambrosia, only
because their karma (which is good in one case, and
bad in the other) forces them to.

'O NA MI'I MIG SHES TSAD MA MA YIN PAR THAL, MI LAS 'BRING PO'I DBANG GIS CHUR MTHONG BA TZAM YIN PA'I PHYIR, GZHAN YANG , MI MA YIN PA'I 'GRO BA'I RGYUD LA LUS SHES TSAD MA DANG , NYAN SHES TSAD MA YANG MED PAR THAL, DE'I RGYUD LA MIG SHES TSAD MA MED PA'I PHYIR, DER THAL, KHYOD KYI RTZA BA'I DAM BCA' 'THAD PA'I PHYIR, 'DOD NA,
Well then, according to you, the visual consciousness of the human wouldn't
be valid perception either. Because isn't it true that the human sees the water
only because his karma (which in this case is halfway between the good and
the bad just mentioned) forces him to? Moreover, aren't you implying then
that there is no such thing as a valid tactile consciousness, or a valid auditory
consciousness, in the mental stream of any being who is not a human?
Because aren't you saying that there's no such thing as a valid visual
consciousness in the mental stream of any such being? Certainly you are, for
you believe your original position to be correct. And suppose now that you
do agree that such beings can have no such valid consciousnesses.

Aren't you then implying that these beings never have any case where they are
able to reach a definite conclusion about something, or to analyze an object?
And if so, aren't you implying that there could never be a case where one of
these beings could recognize another? Of course you are, given your position.

Here secondly is the section where we establish our own position. Now
suppose three different types of beings--a pleasure being, a human, and a
craving spirit, each with their own karma--sit down together and look upon
a glass filled with water, the thing we define as "wet and flowing." The glass
of water is not at this point one thing which is simultaneously three different
objects. Neither is it necessary in this situation for there to be three identical
valid perceptions. And when the glass full of wet and flowing water occurs,
it occurs with three different, distinct parts to it.

It is not though the case that, from the time it first started, the glass of water
came with the three different parts, or that they stay with the glass of water
until it eventually ends. What happens is that one of the parts of the glass
filled with wet and flowing water provides a material cause, and the karma of
the craving spirit provides a contributing factor; and then based on both of
these the later continuation of one part of the glass of water starts being blood
and pus.

DE'I CHA SHAS GCIG GIS NYER LEN DANG , MI'I LAS KYIS LHAN CIG BYED RKYEN BYAS PA LA BRTEN NAS DE'I CHA SHAS GCIG GI RIGS 'DRA PHYI MA CHUR SKYE BA DANG ,
Another part of the glass of water again provides a material cause, and the
karma of the human provides a contributing factor; and then based on both of
these the later continuation of one part of the glass of water starts being water.

Yet another part of the glass of water provides a material cause, and the karma
of the pleasure being provides a contributing factor; and then based on both
of these the later continuation of one part of the glass of water starts being
ambrosia, and so on.

At this point, the glass full of wet and flowing water is something with three
different parts. Nonetheless, it is not the case that all three different beings see
all three parts. The craving spirit is forced by the bad karma he has collected
to see the glass of water as pus and blood; and he doesn't see the other two
things. One should understand that a similar case holds with the latter two
types of beings.

What we just described as happening is only with reference to where a glass
of something wet and flowing is an object shared by the three different beings,
as they look at it together. When the craving spirit himself though picks up
the glass in his hand and begins to partake of its contents, the glass of liquid
is no longer something that exists with three different parts. Since at this point
it is something that the craving spirit is experiencing exclusively, its
continuation starts being pus and blood.

How the glass of liquid exists originally all depends on the particular outer
world from where it has been taken, for each of the three different beings has
a different outer world, depending on the specific karma he himself has
collected. If the glass of liquid were sweet, cool water taken from the world

of humans--a world created by the specific karma of the human in the
group--then that would be its original condition, and so on.

When we say that a craving spirit looks at a stream of water and sees pus and
blood, by the way, we are only talking about some kinds of craving spirits, and
not all of them. This is because there are many kinds of craving spirits: some
with obstacles in the world around them that prevent them from relieving their
craving; some with obstacles that are parts of their bodies; and some with
obstacles that relate to the food or drink itself.

There is, moreover, an example we can use for how, when the three different
types of beings with their three karmas look all together at a glass full of
something wet and flowing, there start to be three different objects, each
confirmed by a valid perception. Suppose there is a ball of red-hot steel; one
piece of this ball provides the material cause, and the "mantra of steel"
provides a contributing factor. Due to these two, a person who has used the
mantra of steel on his hand can touch the ball, but he doesn't undergo any
sensation of heat; instead, he feels some other sensation. A person who has
not used the mantra on his hand touches the ball and does feel a sensation of
heat, and no other kind of sensation.

Another example would be the moon in springtime; one part of the feel of its
rays on the body provides the material cause, and then the karma of a craving
spirit provides a contributing factor. Based on these two, the spirit gets a
sensation of heat, which is experienced by the consciousness of the body.
So too with the wintertime sun; one part of the feel of its rays on the body
provides the material cause, and then the karma of the craving spirit provides
a contributing factor. Based on these two, the spirit gets a sensation of cold,
which is experienced by the consciousness of the body.

It is a fact that they get this kind of sensation, for [Arya Nagarjuna's] Letter to
a Friend states:
For craving spirits, even the light of the moon
In the spring is hot, and even the winter sun cold.

All of this is caused by the extraordinary circumstances of the particular time
and place, for generally speaking it never happens this way: there is nothing
at all about the sun that can feel cold, and nothing about the moon that can

feel hot. This too is a fact, for there does not exist on the sun any case of that
substance we call "covered space."

Here is the third part of our presentation, where we refute the rebuttal of
representatives of other views. You will recall that our own position is
describing a situation where beings of three different types, each with their
own karma, are sitting together and looking at a glass filled with something
that is wet and flowing. The glass filled with something wet and flowing
exists, at this point, as something with three distinct parts. Nonetheless, no
one of the beings is able to see all three things there, for they are each at the
mercy of the particular karma that they themselves have collected.
Representatives of other viewpoints now come to attack this position.

One comes and makes the following claim:
Your position, as just explained, is mistaken, for it
goes against a statement of the glorious Dharmakirti.
This is quite surely the case, for in his major work
[entitled The Commentary on Valid Perception] he says,
Suppose you say that they don't see it,
And circumstances cause another form.
What he's talking about here is a belief of the [non-
Buddhist] Numerist School. They give the case of a
single person whose physical form is looked upon at
the same time by his enemy, and also by his friend.
In reality, the person's physical form is both attractive
and ugly at the same time. Something happens where
yet another physical form, one from karma, grows up
between the person's true physical form and the
enemy and friend looking at it. Because of this neither
the enemy nor the friend sees both the attractiveness
and the ugliness together.
Master Dharmakirti uses logic to refute this concept,
and this same logic can be used against the position
you have taken, to prove that you are wrong.

Your reasoning here is though incorrect, for the belief you have expressed
shows that you have failed to understand both the meaning of Master
Dharmakirti's statement, and the whole position expressed above.

This is a fact, for the actual meaning of Master Dharmakirti's statement is as
follows. The Numerist School is describing a situation where you are looking
at a physical form either from far away, or from up close. They say that,
depending on the distance between you and the object, another physical form
which is the result of karma, and which stands between your visual
consciousness and the original form, is either clear or not. This then
determines whether the original form appears to you distinctly or not. It is not
the case though, they say, that what determines whether the original form
appears clearly or not is whether or not you have a clear impression of this
form.
In reply then Master Dharmakirti is asking the Numerists:
Let's consider these two cases of some intermediate
physical form that comes from karma. Do they, or do
they not, function to obscure the two original forms,
the one at a distance, and the other close by? If they
were to obscure them, then your visual consciousness
could never see the two original forms, since they
would have been obscured by the others.

And suppose you say that they do not obscure them.
Wouldn't your visual consciousness then see both the
two intermediate forms created by karma, and the two
original forms, the near one and the far one, all at the
same time? They would have to because, according to
you, the intermediate forms do not obscure the
original ones.

This is the real point of the Master's statement, wherein he refutes that belief
of the Numerists.

Our second point [that you have failed to comprehend the position we
expressed above] is also quite true. Our original position was describing a
situation where three different kinds of beings were sitting together and
looking at a glass full of something wet and flowing. It is not our position that
the glass full of something wet and flowing is one thing that is three different
things. And it is not our position that there is such a thing as the physical
appearance of a person which is at once both attractive and ugly.
It is furthermore not our position that the blood and pus represent some kind
of physical form which results from karma and grows up between the visual
consciousness of the craving spirit and the stream of water. And it is not our
position that the craving spirit's eyes see both this blood and pus as some kind
of physical form resulting from karma, and the river of water at the same time.
It is our position that, by force of his karma, the craving spirit is not able to see
the stream of water.

And anyway, maybe it's you who have contradicted a statement of the glorious
Dharmakirti. You have taken the position that the five sicknesses, and the five
elements, and the five demons are all the direct result of the five poisons--the
five bad thoughts. But when the non-Buddhists take the position that phlegm
and desire have a cause-and-effect relationship, and that bile and anger have
the same kind of relationship, and so on, then Master Dharmakirti refutes them
by showing that desire doesn't always come and go according to the phlegm,
and anger doesn't always come and go according to the bile. To do so he
makes the statement that says, "It's not a fact that wind and the rest are such,
for the relationship doesn't always hold." We could twist around this
statement too and say that it disproved your position; and add as well how
wrong it is to assert that uncreated space could ever be the direct result of
jealousy.
[The point seems to be that, although your position about the bad thoughts,
and our original position on the nature of the three beings' perceptions, are
both correct, you could always twist around some quotation by a master, take
it out of context or misinterpret it, and try to show they were wrong.]

Someone else might come and make yet another claim:
Let's talk about that quotation above, where it said:
Insofar as [these different beings] have
differing perceptions
Of a single thing, we say it has no reality.
The idea being expressed here is that a single object
can be appearing in three different ways. This is
incorrect because, according to you, what's happening
is that three different objects are appearing in three
different ways. And this certainly is your position;
remember, you were describing a situation where
three different kinds of beings sit down together and
look at a glass full of something that's wet and
flowing. You said that there were three different
objects, each confirmed by a valid perception, and that
they were appearing in three different ways.

Well now, suppose a person is using all four of his limbs, and his head, to
perform five different actions. According to you, it wouldn't be one person
performing five different actions, because five different protuberances of his
body are performing five different actions.

In response to this line of reasoning, someone responds:
No, there's no such problem here. The five
protuberances are all parts of the one person, so we
have to say that, when the five are performing some
actions, the person is performing some actions.

Well the case above is exactly the same! The three things mentioned, the blood
and pus and the other two, are all parts of the glass full of something wet and
flowing. When the three appear then we can say that the glass full of a thing
which is wet and flowing is acting as a basis, and that three different ways of
appearing are being displayed upon it.

Someone else may come now and make yet another argument:
Let's talk about these three things: the pus and blood,
and the other two. Are you implying then that these
are not types of objects which would block each other
from entering the space that each one occupies? After
all, you were talking about a situation where those
three types of beings, each with their own karma, sit
down together and look at a glass full of water. And
you said that your position was that it was possible
for there to be three different objects there, each one
confirmed by a valid perception.

This kind of reasoning, where you attempt to show that we are implying that
the three objects are not the kinds that block each other from entering the space
that each one occupies, cannot disprove our position. It is not our belief that
in this situation the glass full of something which is wet and flowing is one
thing which is three different things. Neither did we ever say that there
definitely had to be identical valid perceptions here.

Someone might make the following claim:
In his Commentary to the Twenty Verses, Master
Vinitadeva makes this statement--
If there was not a single drop of pus there, then
how could there ever be a whole river of pus?
They are forced to see it, through the ripening of
their karma.
According to you, this statement would have to be
mistaken, because when the three different kinds of
beings sit down together and look at the glass full of
something wet and flowing, the visual consciousness
of the craving spirit is a valid perception, and the pus
is real pus.

And yet there is no such problem. No matter how many arguments of this
kind you want to present, they are all made from the point of view of denying
the existence of external objects. The way these arguments go is as follows.
If the color blue were to exist as an external object, then the following would
occur when this color appeared directly to a sense perception grasping blue;
that is, with such a perception found in the mental stream of one of those who
"only sees this side" [which is another name for those who have not yet
perceived emptiness directly].
When an earlier instance of the perception of blue ends, what actually happens
is that it plants a mental seed which eventually grows into a later instance of
the same perception of blue, when the seed ripens. Suppose the blue were not
just this kind of appearance, but rather an appearance where blue as an outer
object were transmitting a likeness of itself and thereby appearing to one's
perceptions. Something else then would be happening when the three different
beings sit down together and look at the glass full of something wet and
flowing. The three different objects would be appearing to them because each
of the objects was transmitting a likeness of itself to their perception. All of
this would be happening independent of any process where each being's karma
planted a mental seed, which later ripened and produced the appearance of the
object.

If this were how the three objects were appearing, then they would not be
appearing through a process where the specific and different karma that each
of the three beings had collected had planted a seed in their mind which later
ripened. As such each of the beings involved would have to be perceiving all
three of the objects, whereas the fact is that they do not.
All this is an argument attempting to refute those who refuse to accept the
denial of outer objects.

The real meaning of the quotation by Master Vinitadeva is therefore the
following:
Suppose there didn't exist a single drop of pus that
existed as it appeared to exist to the craving spirit;
that is, which existed as an outer object. How then
could there exist a whole river full of pus which
existed as an outer object? These beings do though
see the pus and so on, for they are forced to do so by
their karma.

And this is certainly the case, for later on in the text someone argues that, if
the pus and blood did not exist as outer objects, and if they were only a part
of the mind itself, then they could never provide the function of being
something to eat or drink. And in response, Master Vinitadeva says "Actions
and their objects are like an injury in a dream." He is saying that, even though
the pus and blood do not exist as outer objects, nonetheless they can perform
the function of being something to eat or drink. He proves his point by using
a great many examples, such as a dream.

If this were not the case, then one would have to say that form and other such
doorways through which perceptions grow do not even exist at all. Why?
Because you would be saying that all the sutras which state that they exist are
sutras which do not mean what they say; sutras which you have to interpret
to understand their true meaning. And this too is certainly the case, for the
autocommentary to the Twenty Verses states that:
In the same way, statements by the victorious Buddha
where He says that form and other such doors of
perception do exist would be examples of His word
that must be interpreted to establish their real
meaning; statements that are only spoken figuratively,
for the benefit of disciples who might require such
explanations.

In response to this someone might claim:
There's no problem; the point of this statement is to
say that sutras which explain form and similar doors
of perception as actually existing as outer objects are
only spoken figuratively, and must be interpreted to
establish their true meaning.
Well then, the meaning of the original statement then is just the same: it is
saying that "there does not exist even a drop of pus and blood which exists as
an outer object."

Yet again, another argument might be made:
Let's take the case of one of those craving spirits that
looks at a river of water, and sees it as a dry riverbed,
genuinely so. Or consider one that looks at a tree
loaded with fruit, but sees it as nothing but bare
limbs, genuinely so. The visual consciousness of both
of these beings then must be a valid perception.
Why? Remember the case of the three different beings
looking at a glass full of something wet and flowing;
according to you, the pus and blood was actual pus
and blood, and the perception of them by the craving
spirit was genuine: his visual consciousness was a
valid perception.

Just because we said that about the other case doesn't mean that it's true in
every case. If the craving spirit hadn't seen any water in that area in the first
place, it wouldn't have made any sense for him to go over in that direction to
try to enjoy some of the water. Therefore what happened was that, at first, he
saw some water. Later on, he was forced by his karma to stop seeing water
and saw only bare, parched earth. Then he had an impression where he
thought the water had dried up.
The case with the fruit tree is the same. Although at first the craving spirit
sees a tree loaded with fruit, later on his karma forces him to stop seeing fruit,
and all he sees is bare branches. Then he has an impression where he thinks
that the tree has no fruit any more.

When all this is happening, the obstacle in the visual consciousness of the
craving spirit prevents him from seeing the river of water, and so he sees a
dry, parched riverbed. The same is true for the visual consciousness of a
human: if the obstacle were there, it would prevent him from seeing the river
of water, and then he would have to see a dry, parched riverbed.

From one point of view, the river of water hasn't dried up when the craving
spirit looks at it; but there is a river which has dried up, if you're talking about
a river of water that the spirit can see, or a river of water that the spirit can drink
from. This follows because when the three different types of beings sit down
together and look at a glass full of something wet and flowing, it is true that,
due to the force of karma, three different kinds of objects exist there at the
same time: the pus and blood, and the other two.

Given all this, consider craving spirits that have obstacles that relate to their
food and drink itself. The food and drink there really is food and drink, until
such time as the spirit starts trying to eat or drink it. When he does try to do
so, then the continuum of the food into the next moment starts becoming pus
and blood. It is not though that it is the simple appearance of something as
pus and blood that could ever function as something to eat or drink. If this
were the case, then the rules of karma and its consequences would have to be
less that what they really are. And this is true, for if a craving spirit like this
ever existed it would represent a failure of the laws of karma and its
consequences.

Suppose moreover that there were no pus and blood out there to appear as the
pus and blood, and suppose that the mere appearance of something looking
like pus and blood could ever function as something to eat or drink. Well
then, you would also have to be able to use a comb on the hair that appears
on a porcelain sink to a person with cataracts. And a horsefly that appeared
to the same person would have to be able to give him a bite. And the water
of a mirage would have to provide all the normal functions of water, and so
on. Why so? Well because, according to you, there is no pus and blood out
there to appear as pus and blood; according to you, the mere appearance of

And consider again this case where a pleasure being and a human and a
craving spirit and an animal or the like all sit down together and look at a
glass full of something wet and flowing. According to you, it would have to
be genuine when something that just looked like ambrosia appeared to the
pleasure being, and it would have to be genuine when something that just
looked like pus and blood appeared to the craving spirit, but there couldn't be
any pus and blood out there to appear as pus and blood. And if this were the
case, then consider the visual consciousness of a being in the hells. It would
then have to be a valid perception towards something appearing to it that just
looked like the burning steel of the hells, and towards something that just
looked like the forest of swords, and towards something that just looked like
a mass of fire, and so on. Finally, this person would not have any valid

perceptions at all towards any of these things as actual objects. Why would
this all have to be so? If your idea were correct, it would have to be, for the
logic here is identical to your own.

And suppose you agree that this hell being could have no valid perceptions of
the type we mentioned. Well then, the burning steel and other objects could
never perform any real actions: they could never burn the bodies of the people
born there, they could never chop them up, and so on. Why? Well because
of what you just agreed to. And suppose you agree to this; that they could
never perform any real actions. Well then, the torment of the hells itself then
must not even exist, by your own admission. And remember too that case
where the beings all sit down and look at the same thing. You must be saying
then that the actual water, the thing towards which the visual consciousness
of the human is a valid perception, doesn't exist at all. Why? Well because,
according to you, no actual pus and blood exists either in the same situation.

Someone might now make the following claim:
In this situation, there does exist some real water there.
This is because the human can confirm the water with
his own experience, as it performs all the functions of
water--as he uses it to wash himself, or as he uses it
to cook something.

Well then, in the same situation there must exist some real pus and blood there
as well, because in this same situation the craving spirit can confirm the pus
and blood with his own experience as they perform their functions--as he
drinks them, and then as the sizzle in his throat and stomach, and so on.

Someone might make the following claim:
Isn't it true that when all those beings sit down

pus and blood at all? Because isn't it true first of all
that, when a person with cataracts looks into a
porcelain basin, there is no strand of hair in the basin
at all? And, secondly, doesn't [Master Dharmakirti's]
text itself say,
Identical to the case of someone where his sense
power has a cataract,
Is the mind of a craving spirit as well, which
sees a stream of water as pus.

And yet there is no such problem, for this quotation appears in the section
where we are examining the question of whether, in the schools of the Middle
Way and the Mind-Only, an object and the perception of it must be equivalent
in either both existing or both not existing. Moreover, there is another fact
about this situation, where the stream of water appears as pus and blood to the
visual consciousness of the craving spirit. It is no inconsistency to say that the
visual consciousness that sees things this way is not a valid perception, and to
say at the same time that--when the craving spirit looks at the stream of
water--there does exist there actual pus and blood.

Someone again may come and claim the following:
Let's consider once more this situation where three
different types of beings sit down together and look at
a glass full of something wet and flowing. Isn't it true
that there is no actual pus and blood there? Because
isn't it true that the burning steel and so on in the
hells is only something that appears to a person who
is born there, but that there is nothing there which
actually is these objects? Because isn't it true that
there is no one at all who went and made all these
kinds of things? And isn't this a fact, because doesn't
the text of The Bodhisattva's Way of Life say:
Who made the burning steel that acts
As the floor of the world of hell?
Where did all the mass of flames
You find there all come from?
The Able Ones have spoken that
Everything there like this
Is nothing at all other than
The mind of what's non-virtue.

Yet there is no such problem. The point of this quotation is to say that the
burning steel and so on are not something that was created by some
unchanging creator being or something like that; by someone who thought it
over first and then created them. The lines are meant to show us that what
really made all these things is the non-virtuous states of mind had by the
beings who have to take birth there.

If this were not the case, then consider those holy people who lead their lives
following the ten virtues, and who are then born into the higher realms, and
then experience the pleasures of these realms. And consider too those
miserable people who lead their lives following the ten non-virtues, and who
are then born into the lower realms, and then experience the sufferings of these
realms. Is the difference between them just that they are having some better
or worse kind of misperception, and not whether they are experiencing
pleasure or pain? This would have to be the case, if your reasoning were
correct.

'DOD NA, MTHO RIS KYI BDE BA DANG , NGAN SONG GI SDUG BSNGAL MED PAR THAL, 'DOD PA DE'I PHYIR,
Suppose you agree that it is only a matter of better or worse misperceptions.

agree this way.

In conclusion now, let us consider again these three kinds of beings, each with
their different karma, as they sit down together and look at a glass full of
something wet and flowing. It's not necessarily true that they must all have
valid perceptions which are identical. If they did, then the three beings
looking at the glass of water would have to think of the water as a place to
live, in the way that a creature living in water would. The three beings as well
would have to see the water in the same way that microscopic organisms
living in the water, little beings imperceptible to normal visual consciousness,
see it with their own visual consciousness. Then too the visual consciousness
of microscopic organisms living in the depths of the ocean would have to be
a valid perception towards the entire extent of the sea. And certain kinds of
near-gods too would have to see weapons as glasses of water, and on and on;
the problems raised would be many.

Again consider this same situation. Even though it is not necessarily true that
the valid perceptions are identical, it is possible for there to be three valid
perceptions here which happen to be identical. This is because, as we have
already established logically, there can be a case where by the force of karma
three different objects, each one confirmed by a valid perception, start to exist.
And since this is possible, then it is equally possible that, by the force of
karma, three equivalent valid perceptions of a vessel could start to exist as
well.

Generally speaking, each of the three objects mentioned--the pus and the other
two--are things of the type that block other objects from entering into the
space which they themselves occupy. It is no contradiction though to say that,
in this situation where the beings are looking this way, they are not objects
such that they block other things from entering into the space they occupy.
This is true for the following reason.
A central mountain of the world which is square in shape, and a central
mountain of the world which is round in shape, and the like, are objects such
that they block other things from entering the space they occupy.
Nevertheless, it is possible for both these things to occupy the space taken up
by a single central mountain of the world. A red-hot ball of steel is something
that's hot, but consider what happens when a person touches it after he has
used the mantra of steel on his hand. The sensation that he feels is not a
sensation of heat; on the contrary, it is a sensation of something not heat.

Just how do we describe these four types of deeds? Non-virtue represents a
type of deed which is black and ripens into something black. It is black in
that its very nature consists of something afflicted. It also ripens into
something black, for it ripens forth into an undesirable result.

Virtue taken in by the realm of form represents a type of deed which is
white and also ripens into something white. This is first of all because of its
basic nature: it is unmixed with afflicted types of things, within the mental
stream in question. And it ripens forth into a desirable result; with the one
mental stream, it is not mixed together with any suffering.

Virtue taken in by the realm of desire represents a type of deed which is
both white and black, and which also ripens into something both white and
black. Since its basic nature is free of affliction it is white but--since within a
single mental stream it is also mixed with afflicted things--it is black as well.
It ripens into something white because it gives forth a pleasant result
but--since within the particular mental stream this is also mixed with
suffering--we can also say it ripens into something black.

ZAG MED KYI LAS NI MI DKAR MI GNAG RNAM PAR MI SMIN LA, NAG PO DE ZAD PAR BYED PA YIN NO,
Deeds which are unstained never ripen into anything either white or black.
Their nature is to be what brings "it"--that is, the black kind of deed--to an
end.

Here is how these deeds are brought to an end. First let's take the twelve
types of mental movement had with the four instants known as "the mastery
of phenomena," as well as eight instants of the uninterrupted path [part of
the path of seeing, the direct perception of selflessness] which is free of desire.
These are the deeds that act to bring black deeds to an end, for they function
to eliminate all the mental afflictions that relate to the desire realm.

Next let's take that type which is the mental movement in the ninth instant
of the uninterrupted path. This is a deed which acts to end the white and
black, first of all because it eliminates desire-realm virtue by means of
eliminating the aspiration, or the desire, for it. Secondly, it eliminates all the
mental afflictions of the desire realm--the process here being that one stops the
hold which retains them.

Finally, let's consider the final instant in the arising of the uninterrupted path
which is free of desire for the fourth level of concentration. It is by this that
white deeds are brought to an end, for here one eliminates aspiration, that is
desire, for virtue of the formless realm.

According to the claim of certain other groups, deeds which bring one an
experience in the hells are to be understood as the "black" ones. And those
that bring one an experience in some other birth in the desire realm are to be
understood as the two: as deeds that are both white and black.
Still other groups assert that those kinds of deeds which the path of seeing
eliminates are the black ones, while the other deeds that come from the
desire are both white and black.
We turn next to our fifth group of deeds, which includes those divided on the
basis of the person who possesses them.

The undertakings come from the root three.
Because they occur just subsequent to them,
Coveting and the rest come from these three.

Now sutra states that there are three types of killing: that which comes from
desiring something, that which comes from disliking something, and that
which comes from being ignorant of things. One may ask then whether the
various paths of action are each brought to completion by these three roots of
all non-virtue.

MIN TE, MDO LAS GSUNGS PA NI SROG GCOD PA LTA BU'I SBYOR BA RTZA BA GSUM LAS SKYES PA LA DGONGS SO,
The answer is that they are not. The statement from sutra was made only with
reference to the fact that the "undertaking" stages of deeds such as killing
come from the root three.

One may next ask for a description of the process by which the "undertaking"
stages of the ten non-virtues come from the three roots of non-virtue. Let's
start with the act of killing. The "undertaking" stage of this type of act comes
from desire in a case where, for example, you take the life of another being in

order to get its flesh to eat. An instance where this stage comes from dislike
would be where you kill your enemy. And a case where the undertaking stage
comes from being ignorant of things would be where you kill someone like
your father or mother out of some meritorious intent.

Next let's consider the act of stealing. An example of the "undertaking" stage
for this act coming from desire would be where you steal something of value
out of a longing for it. A case where this stage comes from dislike would be,
for example, where you steal something of value from your enemy. An
example of the "undertaking" stage for stealing coming from ignorance is
exemplified by the description that "It's religion when a Brahmin steals."

Sexual misconduct that comes from desire would be a case where, for example,
one engages in some wrong kind of sexual activity because of lustful feelings.
Sexual misconduct born from dislike would be represented by engaging in
sexual intercourse in order to harm someone else's reputation. Sexual
misconduct that you do from ignorance is typified in the statement that "Sex
should be enjoyed by everyone together, like the flowers and the fruits of the
earth, like a banquet ready for the feast, like a pool in the river, like a public
road."

Coveting and the rest of the three misdeeds of thought come from these three
roots of non-virtue because they occur just subsequent to them--to these
three roots. The ten virtues, and here we consider them with all their various
stages (undertaking and conclusion, as well as actual commission), come from
the states of possessing no desire for something, no dislike for a thing, and no
ignorance of things.

deep-seated lack of understanding.

actions motivated by desire, for one example, would be brought to their
completion by desire.

The Objects of Non-Virtue

The objects consist of living beings, enjoyments.
Names and forms, and then of names as well.

One might ask what things serve as the objects for each of the four divisions
of non-virtues just mentioned. The object of the non-virtues of the first
division consists of living beings: killing is to take the life of a living being;
malice is to feel hatred for a living being; and--as the root text itself
says--"harsh speech is that which is unpleasant."

CHA GNYIS PA'I GZHI NI LONGS SPYOD YIN TE, SEMS CAN GYI NANG GI REG BYA LA LONGS SPYOD PA LAS BYUNG BA DANG , DE LA BDAG TU BZUNG BA'I DBANG GIS BYUNG BA'I PHYIR,
The non-virtues of the second division have enjoyments as their object: they
occur through enjoyment in the form of physical sensations within a living
being, or by force of one's taking possession of certain enjoyments.

The objects of the third division are names and forms, for the non-virtue in
this case arises from a view about the virtues and non-virtues that are all part
of names and forms in general. The objects of the last division are names, for
lying and so forth all occur--ultimately--based on the names of things.

"Suppose," one may begin, "that a person takes a weapon and delivers a blow
to someone else which is sure to kill him, but then this murderer himself
happens to die, either before his victim or together with him--at the same
time. Can we say then that the actual "commission" stage of a full path of
action has occurred for such a murderer, or not?"

The answer is that there is no occurrence of this stage for such a person. In
the first place, the stage cannot occur before the victim dies; in the second
place, where the murderer dies at the same time as his victim, another body
of the killer has been born. There is no actual commission because the body
never went through the stage of undertaking this act towards the victim in
question.

One may raise another question: "Suppose a group of people are engaged in
a war or similar activity, and one of these people kills someone from the other
side. Does a path of action occur only for the one person who actually did the
killing?" It does not. Because they are engaged in the war (or whatever
activity it may be) for the same common goal, all the people involved come to
possess a full path of action, just as much as the one who commits it.

"What," one may ask, "is the basic nature of each of the ten non-virtues?" The
taking of life is defined as killing another being purposely, and without a
mistake. The word "purposely" is meant to indicate that there is no problem
like where the being in question has died but there was no intent.

The words "without a mistake" are meant to indicate that no "actual-
commission" stage of an act occurs in a case of mistaken identity; for example,
in a case where you undertake to kill John but instead kill Joe because you
have mistaken him for John. The word "another," finally, is meant to indicate
that no "actual-commission" stage occurs either in an instance where one takes
his own life.

Stealing is to take possession of another's wealth, purposely and without a

Sexual misconduct is engaging in kinds of sex which are improper to

This sexual misconduct is of four different types, as the number of the
following list each constitutes one of its forms:
1) sex with someone else's wife or with a woman who, although
she is not another person's wife, is too closely related to
oneself--his mother, or sister, or any female related to one up
to seven generations past;
2) sex with a woman, even if she is one's wife, using an improper
part of her body--her mouth or anus;
3) sex in an improper place--out in the open or in the environs of
a shrine or temple; and
4) sex at an improper time--while a baby is still nursing from the
woman, or when she is pregnant, or during the period that she
is observing the one-day layman's vow.

Now sutra makes mention of the "eight expressions of a child" [one who has
yet to see selflessness directly], which consist of:
1) four types where you say "I didn't see it" and so on about four
different kinds of things--things that you really did see, hear,
know, or sense; and
2) four types where you say "I did see it" and so on about another
four kinds of things--things that you really didn't see, hear, know,
or sense.

Sutra also mentions the "eight expressions of a realized person"--four where
you say "I did see it" about things you really did see and so on; four where
you say "I didn't see it" about things you really didn't see and such.
Regarding these two sets of eight, one may ask for a more detailed description
of the basic four: what it is to be "something seen," "something heard," and so
on. That which is experienced by consciousness of the eye, consciousness of
the ear, consciousness of the thought, and by the other three kinds of
consciousness (those of nose, tongue, and body) represents respectively what
is seen, what is heard, what is known, and also what is sensed.
We turn next to a description of the six "branch" non-virtues.

Divisive speech, the words of a mentally

Wrong desire for another's wealth.

Divisive speech consists of words which are spoken purposely, without any

"Meaningless speech" really refers to every case of words spoken in an
afflicted state of mind. Other groups say that what "meaningless speech"

actually refers to is every afflicted type of the spoken word other than those
three already mentioned. They say cases would be like a monk's engaging in
the improper livelihood of flattering someone for the purpose of some gain,
or else singing a song out of desire.

Coveting consists of a wrong (that is, an improper) desire for another's
wealth, which leads to a wish that one make it his own. Harmful intent is the
desire to hurt another living being, a desire which comes from the attitude of
hating him. And mistaken view is the idea that neither virtue nor non-virtue
even exists.
Next we discuss the literal meaning of the expression "a path of action."
79
Explanation of the Expression
"Path of Action"

   'DI LA,
,GSUM LAM BDUN NI LAS KYANG YIN,
In them,
Three are paths, seven deeds as well.
[IV.311b-12]

,GSUM PA NI, BCU PO 'DI LA CI'I PHYIR LAS KYI LAM ZHES BYA ZHE NA, YID KYI GSUM LAS SEMS PA 'JUG PA'I LAM YIN PA DANG , LUS NGAG GI BDUN NI LAS KYANG YIN LA, SEMS PA 'JUG PA'I LAM YANG YIN PAS NA LAS KYI LAM ZHES BYA'O,
One may ask why the expression "path of action" is used in reference to
"them"--to the group of ten just listed. The name derives first of all from the
fact that the three involved with thought are paths by which the "action" or
deed of mental movement is expressed. Moreover, the seven involved with
body and speech are action or deeds themselves, as well as paths through
which mental movement is expressed. Thus they are all "paths of action."
The fourth major part in our presentation of the "paths of action" concerns the
ways in which one loses, and then regains, his most basic virtue.

The following selections are from the Great Book on the Steps of the Path,

Here is the first. One may ask, "How do you define the act of killing?" The
Abbreviation says that five parts are involved: the object, the conception, the
thinking, the bad thought, and the conclusion. These five can be shortened
into four: the middle three can be included into the thinking, and we can add
the stage of undertaking; this makes the presentation easier, and in no way
violates the intention of the original text.

RNAL 'BYOR SPYOD PA'I SA LAS SROG CHAGS PHA ROL PO ZHES GSUNGS SO, ,
Now the object for killing is a sentient being: anything with life. The Levels of
Practitioners does state "another living being," but is only referring to the fact
that, when the murderer is murdering himself, there is a wrong deed of
undertaking, but not one of completion.

The part of the thinking has three components of its own. Conception can be
of four different types: to conceive of the object, say a living being, as being a
living being; to conceive of a living being as something other than a living
being; to conceive of something other than a living being as being other than
a living being, and to conceive of this same thing as a living being. The first
and third types of conception here are unmistaken; the second and fourth are
mistaken.

This is a particular feature of the motivation. Suppose, for example, that you
think to yourself, "I only want to kill John," and undertake the deed. Then you
mistake Joe for John, and kill Joe. In this sort of case, there is no "actual-
commission" stage; so we can see that, for this stage, the conception you have
must be unmistaken. If on the other hand you undertake the deed with some
general kind of motivation, if you think to yourself, "I'll kill anyone I happen
to meet," then this detail of the conception having to be unmistaken need not
be complete. You should understand that this point applies to the other nine
as well.

NYON MONGS PA NI, DUG GSUM GANG RUNG NGO , ,
The second component of the thinking is the bad thought involved. In this
case, it can be any of the three poisons.
A third component is the motivation; here, it is the wish to kill.

Here are the different aspects of the undertaking. As far as the one who
undertakes the deed, it doesn't matter whether you perform it yourself, or get
someone else to do it for you, it's all the same. The essence of the undertaking
is when the deed is initiated, either with some kind of weapon, or poison, or
spell, or whatever the case may be.

The conclusion occurs when, due to this undertaking of the deed, the other
person dies, either at the time of the undertaking, or later on. As the Treasure
House of Knowledge says,
There is no actual stage for those who die
Before or together, for another body's been born.

The movements of the mind are an action (karma) but not a path of action.
The seven of body and speech are both an action and--because they are the
basis in which the movement of the mind engages--are also a path of action.
The three of coveting and so on are a path of action but not themselves action
(karma).

Most basic lost by the view they don't exist;
Taken in the desire, had from birth.
Through the one denying cause and effect,
And through all. In stages, among humans,
Lost by those who are male or female, by the

[IV.313-8]

,BZHI PA NI, MI DGE BA GANG GIS DGE RTZA GCOD CE NA, MED PAR LTA BAS DGE BA'I RTZA BA GCOD PAR BYED DO,
One may ask just what kind of non-virtue can make one lose his most basic
virtue. The most basic virtue that a person possesses is lost by the view that
certain important objects don't even exist.

,JI LTA BU ZHE NA, 'DOD PAR GTOGS PA'I DGE RTZA GCOD KYI, GZUGS GZUGS MED KYI DGE RTZA MI GCOD DE, DE'I RGYUD LA DE MED PA'I PHYIR,
One may next ask how the process occurs. Most basic virtue which is taken
in by the realm of desire can be lost, but not that which is taken in by the
form or formless realms. This is because the types of views required can never
appear in the mental streams of the beings of these realms.

Even among the most basic virtues included in the realm of desire, only those
which one had from birth can be lost--never those which have been acquired
by applying some efforts in practice. This is because these latter types of
virtue are gone by the time the mistaken views involved have even reached a
minor stage of minor intensity. They have been lost because the hold retaining
them was lost.

LOG LTA YANG RGYU DANG 'BRAS BU LA SKUR BA 'DEBS PAS GCOD KYI, 'PHAGS PA LA SKUR BA 'DEBS PAS GCOD PA MIN NO,
As for the type of mistaken view involved, a person loses his most basic virtue
through the one denying the principles of cause and effect. It is not however
the view that realized beings do not exist which causes one to lose his most
basic virtues.

,BAG MED DANG BSKAL BA MI MNYAM PAS GCOD PA MIN ZER YANG , SKAL BA MNYAM MI MNYAM ZAG BCAS ZAG MED LA DMIGS PA KUN GYIS GCOD PAR BYED,
Now some make the claim that views involving unstained phenomena or levels
which are not comparable cannot cause a person to lose his most basic virtues.
The fact though is that this virtue can be lost through all the forms of this

How exactly does the loss occur? Some claim that a person loses his most
basic virtue all at once, the same way he loses all the undesirable objects that
the path of seeing eliminates, once he gains this path. What actually happens
though is that the virtue is lost in stages, the same way one loses the
undesirable objects eliminated by the path of habituation.

One may next ask what kind of being can lose his basic virtue. Such a loss can
occur among humans of the three continents, but not among other types of
beings. The afflicted mental capacity of hell beings lacks the necessary
stability, and the same lack of stability characterizes the non-virtuous thoughts
of humans on the continent of Terrible Sound. Pleasure beings in the realms
of desire and form are beings who see the three conditions directly; the
principles of cause and effect are evident to them therefore, just after their
birth.

MI YANG SKYES PA DANG BUD MED KYIS GCOD KYI, ZA MA DANG MA NING GIS MI GCOD DE, SDIG PA'I BSAM PA MI BRTAN PA'I PHYIR,
Even among humans, basic virtue is lost by those who are male or
female--not by those who have lost their sexual organ, or who never had one.
This is because non-virtuous thoughts in the minds of such beings are never
very stable.

MI LA LTA BA SPYAD BA DANG SRED PA SPYAD PA GNYIS KYI NANG NAS SNGA MA DE LA GCOD PAR BYED DE, SHES RAB NYON MONGS PA CAN BRTAN PA'I PHYIR,
Humans in general can be divided into two types: the more intellectual, and
the more sensual. It is the former of the two that can lose this virtue, for they
are capable of sustained intellectual activity marred by mental afflictions.

DGE RTZA CHAD PA DE'I NGO BO NI DGE RTZA DANG MI LDAN PA'O,
The basic nature of this loss or what we call "cut-off" of a person's most basic
virtue is simply not to have it.

How Most Basic Virtue is Regained

,MTSAMS NI THE TSOM YOD LTA BAS,
,MTSAMS MED BYED PA'I 'DI LA MIN,
Regained by suspecting, view there are;
Not in this, when immediate's done.
[IV.319-20]

"What," one may ask, "can help a person regain his most basic virtue after he
has lost it?" This virtue can first be regained simply by suspecting that the
principles regarding deeds and their results may actually exist. It can also be
regained by gaining the correct view, whereby one actually perceives that there
really are such principles.

DGE RTZA CHAD PA DE TSE 'DI LA MTSAMS SBYOR BAR NGES SAM ZHE NA, MTSAMS MED BYED PA'I TSE 'DI LA SBYOR BA MIN NO,
One may ask whether it is always certain that a person will be able to regain
his most basic virtue in the same life that he lost it. The answer is that he does
not regain the virtue in this same life when he has done any of the
"immediate" type of wrong deeds.

,DUS NAM GYI TSE SBYOR ZHE NA, SNGON RGYU'I STOBS KYIS DGE RTZA CHAD NA DMYAL BA NAS 'CHI 'PHO BA'I TSE SBYOR, RKYEN GYI STOBS KYIS DGE RTZA CHAD NA DMYAL BAR SKYES PA'I TSE MTSAMS SBYOR BA YIN NO,
"When then," one may ask, "does such a person regain his basic virtue?" If he
originally lost this virtue because of some main cause, then the person regains
it once he dies and migrates out of his hell birth. If on the other hand it was
only some secondary factor that made him lose the virtue, then he regains it
when he takes his hell birth.

Does a single deed project but a single birth, or many different births? And
do a number of deeds project a number of births, or just a single birth? The
answer is that a single deed projects a single birth; it cannot project a number
of births. And since they would function to project a whole group of similar
births, a number of deeds on the other hand is never something that projects
but a single birth. This by the way is all the Detailist system.

,'O NA RGYAL PO DANG YANG DAG PAR LDAN PA'I MDO LAS,
Now someone may object that this description contradicts the following
quotation from the Sutra of Sovereignty--

GNAS BRTAN MA 'GAGS PAS DGE SLONG RNAMS LA SMRAS PA, TSE DANG LDAN PA DAG BDAG WA RA nA SIR SKYES BU DBUL PO RTZVA 'THU BA ZHIG TU GYUR PA NA, RANG SANGS RGYAS STENG GNAS BSAM SHES BYA BA'AM, SPYI GTZUG ME TOG TA KAR LTA BU ZHES BYA BA LA BSOD SNYOMS PHUL TE,
The elder, Aniruddha, spoke to the monks as follows:
"Venerable monks, I once took a birth in
Varanasi, as a poor man whose job it was to
collect straw for use as fuel. The poor man
made the traditional offerings of food to a Self-
Made Buddha by the name of Tengnesam [?],
who was also known as `the one with the top
center part of his head protruding like a takar
flower.'

"My one act of giving away these offerings
ripened into a birth as a pleasure being in the
Land of the Thirty-Three. I was born there a
total of seven times, and then took another seven
births as a Wheel Emperor. And still it
continues now, with my present birth into the
wealthier class of the Shakyas."

Yet there is no contradiction: the process was as follows. His offerings brought
the poor man the good fortunes of a happier birth; later, he recalled what had
brought him this state. These recollections themselves brought him still further
merit. Thus although we can say that the one act of merit brought him such
and such different births, what we really mean is that he achieved these births
through a process that began with the one act. It's like saying "I got rich on
a single dong-tse [an amount of money]" when what you really did was start
with a single dong-tse and turn it over in a great many business deals until
eventually you became wealthy.

,YANG NA BSOD SNYOMS GCIG PHUL BA DE LA BRTEN NAS DGA' BA DANG YID RANG PA LA SOGS PA'I SEMS PA'I LAS DU MA YOD PA'I PHYIR DE DAG GI 'BRAS BU YIN NO,
You could also say that the poor man started with the one instance of offering
food and that it caused numerous instances of gladness and rejoicing over the
act; these are themselves deeds consisting of a movement of the mind, and the
many births can be said to have resulted from them.
95
The Finishing Energy of Deeds

,YONGS RDZOGS BYED PA DU MA YIN,
Those that act to finish them off are many.
[IV.378]

It is but a single energy of deeds that projects a birth having a nature
consistent with the deed; those deeds though that act to finish off the finer
details of this future life are many. A master painter for example can sketch
out the canvas with a single piece of chalk, and then a number of other people
can come and fill it in with various different colors.

Any given group of people is similar in being human, but some of them
who've had the details of their lives finished by virtuous deeds will have more
attractive bodies, all their senses complete, greater material wealth, freedom
from illness, positions of greater authority, and so on. Others in the same
group who've had the details of their lives finished by non-virtuous deeds will
have bodies with a repulsive appearance and so on.

Thus we can say that all four combinations between the two are possible:
projection of a life by virtue but finishing by non-virtue, the reverse, a case
where both are virtue, and a case where both are non-virtue. An example of
the first would be persons born as pleasure beings or humans but who
possessed certain sufferings.

An illustration of the second would be either the "Lord of All Things"--the
Lord of Death--or the kings of the serpent-like nagas, those like the "Prince of
Opulence." An example of the third combination would be "Hundred
Offerings"--lord of the great pleasure beings. And a case of the final
combination would be the beings in the lowest hell, known as "No Respite."

The Sutrists and others assert though that there are many explanations, in a
number of different sutras, that a single deed can project multiple rebirths.
Therefore, they say, a single deed can project many births and a number of
deeds can as well project a single birth.

Deeds that do not Project a Life

Never act to project; neither do holds.

One may ask whether every different kind of deed can function to project a
new life. The answer is that the two balanced meditations that stop the mind
never act to project a life, even though they do come with the "ripened" sorts
of results. This is because the lives in question have already been projected,
by the fourth concentration level and the "peak" level. Moreover, beings in
these states have no mind--and deeds that do not occur together with a
movement of the mind are of very little force.

Thus we can say the expression that "the two balanced meditations ripen into
the long life of a pleasure being, or into a life at the peak level" refers only to
their function in finishing the final details of such rebirths. The projecting
force though is something supplied by the fourth level of concentration and the
"peak" level of existence.

Neither do holds, whether they be virtuous or non-virtuous, act to project a
life--even when they occur together with a particular deed. First of all, the
deed and the hold have different results. Secondly, the hold is only an
incidental occurrence, for it does not involve a movement of the mind. It is
therefore of very little force. Finally, the hold is to the deed as the bark is to
the tree--something distinctly separate.

Holds however which constitute either virtue with stain or non-virtue do
function to finish off the details of a given life. Just so examples of stained
deeds that are present in the mental stream of a realized being, as well as the
four stages of the peak of preparation (which we also call the "path that leads
to certain separation") function only as "finishing" types of energy.

The first three of the five "immediate" misdeeds mentioned above are different
types of killing, and the fifth is a preliminary to killing. These are, therefore,
deeds of the body. The fourth of the immediate misdeeds is a kind of lie, and
therefore a deed of speech.

Now a split in the community of monks, at least according to the Detailist
system, is said to "exist as a distinct entity--it is a thing (one of the factors)
without involvement in a mental link; its basic nature is for the two factions
of the community of monks to be still unreconciled.

Such a split can also belong to both those who have eliminated their mental
afflictions and those who have lost even their most basic virtue; the nature of
the split is thus such that it is not afflicted, but neither was it specified as
being virtue. We can therefore say that it is ethically neutral, without acting
as an obstacle.

The kind of schism described here is something the community of monks on
both the opposing sides possesses. It is not though the "immediate" misdeed
itself. The disapproved deed that leads to the community's division--its
cause--is a lie that functions to split the community up.

DGE 'DUN 'BYED PAR BYED PA'I RDZUN TE DE NI MTSAMS MED YIN LA, DE NI DGE 'DUN 'BYED PAR BYED PA PO LHAS BYIN LA SOGS PA DANG YANG DAG PAR LDAN NO,
It is the lie which constitutes the immediate misdeed, and this the one who
made the schism in the community has--whether it be Devadatta or someone
else.

"Into what kind of consequence," one may ask, "does the immediate misdeed
of dividing the community ripen?" It ripens into suffering, for the person who
committed it, within the hell known as "Without Respite." He must endure
this suffering for the length of an intermediate eon.

"And what happens," one might continue, "when a person commits any of the
remaining immediate misdeeds?" Committing any of these other immediate
misdeeds is certain to lead one to a birth in the hells, but in a more specific
sense it is not a definite thing that they will always bring a birth in the hell
Without Respite.

One might next pose the following question:
Suppose a person commits two, or even more, of the
"immediate" misdeeds. If he takes only one birth in
the hells, then you would have to say that committing
several of these deeds is no more serious than
committing only one. If one the other hand he takes
two or however many births in the hells, you can no
longer say that these deeds give "immediate" results,
and that their results are invariably experienced in the
very next life.

The Detailists respond with the following claim:
A person takes no more than a single birth in the hells
as a result of committing "extra ones"--that is two,
three, or even more immediate misdeeds. His body
there in the hell of "Without Respite" though is twice
the normal size (or more, according to the number of
such deeds committed), and much more sensitive. He
therefore feels an extra amount of pain: his torment
increases in multiples the same way as his size. This
frees us of both the problems you raised; incidentally,
the earlier of the deeds is the one that projects the
birth and the later one (or ones) finishes the details.

The Sutrists and others though explain the point as follows:
If a person commits a number of immediate misdeeds,
he is born into the hell of torment Without Respite
again and again. There is though no other type of
birth taken between the body in which the deed was
done and the body of the hellbeing, so the result is
still "immediate." The idea that the result must be
experienced in the very next life cannot be
substantiated.

What kind of person causes the split? The schism is made by someone who
is a full monk and an intellectual type with all his morals. The person in
question cannot be a layman, or the type more inclined to sensual pleasures,
or someone who has lost his morals. This is because, first of all, he is vying
with the Buddha. Secondly, he must have a very sharp mind. Finally, the
community of monks would lend no credence to such types.

Where does the split occur? It must take place "elsewhere"--that is, in some
location other than where the Buddha himself is residing. It could never occur
in the direct presence of the Buddha, since his overwhelming glory would
never permit it. And who is it that gets split off? It is only "children"--that
is to say, common beings [which refers to those who have yet to see
selflessness directly]--among the community of monks who are estranged.
Realized beings cannot be led into a schism, for they possess a faith in the
Buddha born from knowledge: they have perceived Reality directly.

One may ask at what point a schism is considered to have occurred. The
community of monks is considered split at that point when, first of all, there
is an acceptance of some Teacher (namely, Devadatta) other than the Buddha
himself. Secondly, this is the point where there is an acceptance and attempt
to practice some path other than that enunciated by the Buddha. This
opposing path consists of the "Five Rules" set forth by Devadatta for attaining
freedom from the world:
1) giving up the use of curds;
2) giving up meat;
3) giving up salt;
4) giving up the traditional patchwork robes; and
5) staying in temples inside of towns.

,DUS JI SRID DU GNAS ZHE NA, BYE BA DE NI CHOS NYID KYIS ZHAG GCIG LAS RING DU MI GNAS SO,
And how long does the schism last? This split in the community has its own

A division of the community of monks is accepted as a breaking of the wheel
of the teachings, for no new paths start up in the minds of anyone at all until
the estranged monks are reconciled. What we've described here is the
immediate misdeed of a schism in the community; other types of divisions are
possible, but do not constitute the "immediate" type of deed.

The break in the wheel described above occurs on Dzambu Continent (as this
is where the Buddha resides), but not on the others. As for the individuals
involved, the deed can only be accomplished with nine "or such" (meaning "or
more") full monks. This is because it takes at least four monks to make what
we call a "community" of monks; there have to be two such groups created,
along with one person who incites the schism--and he too must definitely be
a full monk. This of course represents the bare minimum--there is no
certainty that a great many more individuals might not be involved in such a
schism.

Now what we call a "split in the activities" of the community can occur on
three different continents--that is, on any one where the teachings exist, which
would eliminate only the northern continent of Terrible Sound. This type of
schism occurs only within the confines of a single physical monastic institution,
and where the required rites of the monastic confession and so on have been
performed with unity up to that point.

,GANG ZAG DUS ZHE NA, LAS KYI DBYEN DE NI 'BYED PA PO GZHAN MI DGOS PAS, DGE SLONG BRGYAD YAN CHAD KYIS 'GRUB BO,
How many individuals are required for this type of schism? A split in the
activities of the community requires no separate person to incite the division,
so the deed can be accomplished with the involvement of eight or more full
monks.

Now a breaking of the wheel of the teachings as described above never occurs
at "the beginning"--that is, during the period just after the Buddha has first
set this wheel in motion. This is because at this point everyone shares a
peculiar sense of unity, a perfect harmony born of communal joy.

Neither does the break ever occur at the end of the Buddha's precious
life--when he passes into his final nirvana. This is because his followers at
this point share exactly the same thoughts: a special awareness of how rare the
Buddha is, and strong feelings of resignation with life once its impermanence
has been drawn to their attention then.

This means that a schism in the community will furthermore never happen
before certain faults occur--faults in the way that followers view the teachings
and maintain their morality. For until such time, the teachings themselves
remain without defect.

Furthermore, no division can occur before the appearance of one or another
of The Great Pair. This is because the division is of very brief duration and
could not otherwise be brought to an end, since the reconciliation is always
performed by one of these two.

THUB PA NONGS PA STE MYA NGAN LAS 'DAS PA'I 'OG TU'ANG MI 'BYUNG STE, GANG LA 'GRAN PA'I SANGS RGYAS MI BZHUGS PA'I PHYIR,
No schism can occur after The Able One himself passes on (that is, subsequent
to his final nirvana), since there is then no Buddha present for the leader of the
schism to compete with.

Finally, no division of the community can occur until such time as different
monastic residences, both large and small, are set apart from each other. This
is because divisions between the community of monks that occur within a
single monastic institution do not qualify as a breaking of the wheel, although
they are a type of schism. In summary then we can say that there are six
periods during which it is impossible for a break in the wheel of the teachings
to occur.

Now this schism is something that depends upon the past deeds of the
disciples involved, so does not occur with every single Buddha. The
explanation goes that, in a former birth as a bodhisattva, our own Teacher (the
Leader of the Shakyas) created a schism among the followers of a certain great
adept who possessed the five types of supernormal powers: the present schism
is just the eventual ripening of this misdeed. According to the teachings for
those of higher capacity though this description is not to be taken literally.

What Makes Deeds Immediate

Since you reject and also eliminate them.

One may ask the following: "Why is it considered an `immediate' misdeed only
when a person performs one of the actions such as killing his father or mother?
Why isn't it the same kind of deed when a person commits an act, such as the
killing, towards someone else?" The answer is that killing one's father or
mother is an "immediate" misdeed as they are very special objects, due to the
great assistance they have rendered one: they have given you a body, a body
with which you can attain freedom. And by thinking to kill them you reject
them; by actually undertaking the deed, you also eliminate them.

The case with enemy destroyers, the community of monks, and Buddhas is
similar. They are objects possessed of exceptional qualities; by thinking to do
the particular deed towards them you reject them, and by actually undertaking
the various deeds involved you create conditions which are not at all
conducive to their continued life.

Here we should mention that, although it is impossible for anyone to actually
kill a Buddha, the thought to do so is a rejection of the Buddha. Kinds of
actions other than those described above are in no way as serious, so are not
counted among the "immediate" misdeeds.

Clarification of Certain
Immediate Misdeeds

It is, even should the organ switch.

One might ask the following question: "Suppose a person kills a father or
mother whose sexual organ has changed. Is it still an `immediate' misdeed?"
Even should the sexual organ of one's father or mother switch (and they thus
become a female or a male, respectively), it is still the "immediate" deed of
patricide or matricide if he kills them. This is because one has still killed the
person who performed the function of a father or mother: the one who
endowed him with his very special body.

GAL TE BUD MED GZHAN GYI NUR NUR PO, , GZHAN GYI MNGAL DU BLUG NAS DE'I MNGAL DU BSKYED NA, BUD MED GNYIS PO DE LAS GANG BSAD NA MTSAMS MED DU 'GYUR ZHE NA, GNYIS PO DE LAS BUD MED DANG PO GANG GI ZLA MTSAN LAS BYUNG BA DE NYID DE'I MA YIN PAS, BUD MED DANG PO DE BSAD NA 'GYUR TE, THAR PA DAR MTHUN PA'I LUS DE SKYED PA'I GTZO BO YIN PA'I PHYIR,
One may then pose another question: "Suppose the embryo in one woman's
body is removed and placed in the womb of another, and the child takes birth
from this woman's womb. Killing which of these two women would constitute

the `immediate' misdeed?" The mother of the person in question is the former
of the two women: the one whose menses he came from. Therefore killing
this first woman would be the immediate misdeed; she played the principal
role in providing the person a body fit for gaining freedom. We could not
consider the second woman, the woman who kept the child in her womb, the
child's mother--this act alone would not make hers the principal role.

Now it is not an "immediate" misdeed if a person undertakes to kill his father
or mother and ends up killing someone else; nor is it if one undertakes to kill
someone else and ends up killing one of his parents. This is because, with an
"immediate" misdeed, the actual commission of the act must be concluded with
the same person towards whom the act was undertaken. And this is true of
neither of the cases mentioned. Similar examples would be where the person
killed his mother by accident as she hid under his bed, or where the son of the
washerman threw a rock to kill a fly and smashed his father's skull instead.

Suppose that a person, in the single blow of some weapon, kills his mother and
some other living being. The non-communicating form here consists of both
deeds: the "immediate" misdeed and a simple act of killing. The
communicating form though is subsumed only by the immediate deed, since
an immediate deed possesses such tremendous force.

Next let's take a case where a person kills his father, a father who happens to
be an enemy destroyer as well. Or suppose he kills a person who is both his
mother and an enemy destroyer too. Here he commits a single "immediate"
misdeed, that of killing an enemy destroyer--for only the single physical base
of a person was involved.

One may ask how then we reconcile this position with the following message,
quoted in Divisions of the Word:
In days gone by there was a king of Rauruka City by
the name of Udrayana. He was murdered by his son
Shikhandi, who thus killed a person who was both his
father and an enemy destroyer. The King's last words
to the assassins sent by his son were "Return and tell
Shikhandi for me, `You have now committed two
immediate misdeeds--that of killing your father, and
that of killing an enemy destroyer.'"

DE NI KHYOD KYIS RGYU GNYIS KYIS MTSAMS MED PA BYAS TE ZHES PA'AM, YANG NA SGO GNYIS NAS SPYOS PA YIN GYIS, MTSAMS MED DE NI GCIG LAS MED DO,
The point of the king's words was to tell his son that he had on two accounts
committed an immediate misdeed, or that he had committed the deed in two
different ways. There was though no more than one immediate misdeed done.

Let's next consider the immediate misdeed of striking and drawing blood, with
evil intent, from the One Thus Gone. It's considered the immediate misdeed
when a person uses his weapon with the intent to kill the Buddha, but it is not
considered this type of misdeed when a person uses his weapon simply with
a mind to strike the Buddha. This is because such a person lacks the "intent"
stage for an act of taking life.
Suppose for a similar example that someone uses a weapon against a person
who has yet to reach the stage of "enemy destroyer," and then at some point
after the attack the victim does attain this level. Suppose further that our new
enemy destroyer then dies as a result of wounds incurred in the original attack.
It is not considered the immediate misdeed with such a person, for his attacker
did not undertake the action against someone who was an enemy destroyer.

One may pose the following question: "Suppose a person undertakes to commit
an immediate misdeed. Is it possible for such a person--without abandoning
this course of action--to achieve the state where he is free of desire, or to gain
one of the results?" The answer is that it is impossible for one who has
undertaken an immediate misdeed to gain either the level where he is freed
from desire or one of the results. The two states of mind are completely
contradictory.

One may ask, "Which of all these immediate misdeeds is the most serious?"
Lying in order to divide the community of monks into two parts is accepted
as the most heinous of misdeeds among all the immediate. This is because
a person has thereby struck a blow to what is known as the "reality body" of
the One Thus Gone. And as long as the community remains unreconciled,
there is a general stop in the world to certain great virtuous deeds: no one
finds the true certainty, no one achieves the results, no one gains freedom from
desire, and no one brings an end to all stains.

Moreover, such a division prevents persons from engaging in meditative
concentration, and from reading scripture--from daily recitations and from
contemplations. This then interrupts progress in gaining both higher births
and the states of nirvana and Buddhahood. All the inhabitants of the world,
on up to the great pleasure beings, are thrown into turmoil--they lose their
happiness, they lose their freedom, they lose their ability to think. And the
perpetrator must take his birth in the lowest hell, Without Respite, for an eon.
These are what make this deed the worst.

The next most grave of the immediate misdeeds is the fifth; then come the
third, the first, and second--in that order. Thus the murder of one's father is
explained as the least serious of the five.

One may object that this description contradicts the statement in sutra that, of
all the three types of wrong, the three deeds of thought are most serious and
that--within these three--holding mistaken views is most grave. There is
though no inconsistency here. The misdeed we've described leads one to the
hell "Without Respite" for a full intermediate eon; from the viewpoint of the
magnitude of the result that ripens from the deed, we can say that dividing the
community is the most serious of all the immediate misdeeds.

One the other hand there is the case where the raw emotion of fury in the
mind of the great adept brought death to the many individuals of Dantaka
Monastery and other places; we can say then that, with respect to the general
result of death among the populace, actions of the thought are the most
powerful among three groups of deeds that relate to the three passageways.

And with respect to the "creative" result of losing one's most basic virtue,
mistaken views would be the most serious of the deeds of the thought, for the
others in this group lack the power to make one lose this virtue. To express
it in a different way, we can say that each was stated to be the most serious:
dividing the community, deeds of the thought, and holding mistaken
views--but only with the respective assumptions that one is limiting himself
to the five immediate deeds, deeds of the three passageways, or the five views.

Now among these three, giving is described as follows. It is when any person,
with thoughts of virtue, acts to give any thing he owns to someone else. As
we read in A Sutra Taught at the Request of Vyasa, a Great Adept: "Oh great
adept, all acts of giving even the smallest thing from faith are Giving."

As for the motivation involved, it is only the meritorious act of giving when
one gives away the thing either out of a wish to honor (some very high object)
or out of a wish to aid (some very miserable object). It is not real giving when
one does so only out of fear, or out of hopes of getting something in return,
and so on.

,LAS DE YANG LUS DANG NGAG GI LAS KUN NAS SLONG BA MTSUNGS LDAN DANG BCAS PA YIN NO, , SBYIN PA DE'I 'BRAS BU NI GNAS SKABS SU LONGS SPYOD CHEN PO CAN NO,
Giving moreover consists of deeds of body and speech along with their
motivation and what is linked with it mentally. The result of the giving is the
possession of great wealth, at least for the time being.

Giving that Benefits the Other,
and the Rest

,BDAG GZHAN DON PHYIR GNYIS DON PHYIR,

Giving is that which benefits oneself,
The other, both, and neither one of them.

As for the different divisions of giving, the first is that giving which benefits
oneself. This would be for a person who had not yet freed himself from desire
for desire-realm objects, or for a common person who had done so but through
the "path of the world," to make offerings to a shrine.

Giving that benefits the other would be any act of giving performed by a
realized person free of desire towards another living being not so freed. This
assumes by the way that we do not consider any results that the former
individual will experience in this same life.

,GNYIS KA'I DON GYI PHYIR SBYIN PA NI 'PHAGS PA 'DOD CHAGS DANG MA BRAL BA'AM, SO SO SKYE BO 'DOD CHAGS DANG MA BRAL BAS, 'DOD CHAGS DANG MA BRAL BA'I SEMS CAN GZHAN LA SBYIN PA'O,
Giving that benefits both would be for a realized being who was not yet free
of desire, or for a common being who was not thus free, to present something
to another living being who was not yet free from desire either.

,GNYIS KA'I DON DU MIN PA'I PHYIR SBYIN PA NI, MTHONG CHOS LA MYONG BA MA GTOGS PA 'PHAGS PA 'DOD KHAMS LAS 'DOD CHAGS DANG BRAL BAS MCHOD RTEN LA PHUL BA YIN TE, DE NI BKUR STI DANG BYAS PA GZO BA 'BA' ZHIG GIS 'BUL PA'I PHYIR,
Giving that benefits neither would be for a realized being who was free of
desire for the desire realm to make offerings to a shrine. This is because the
only point of the offering is for this being to express his deep respect and
gratitude. Here again incidentally we are not counting any results of the
offering that he will achieve in the same life.

Very exceptional types of "it"--of this giving, come from exceptional kinds of
givers, exceptional kinds of things which are given, and exceptional kinds of
objects to whom the things are given. Of these, the giver is made exceptional
through a motivation of faith and "the rest"--which refers first of all to the
rest of the "seven riches of realized beings": morality, generosity, learning, a
sense of shame, a conscience, and wisdom. The phrase also refers to having
little desire for things.

As for how he undertakes the act, the exceptional giver performs his giving
(1) with an attitude of respect and "the like." These last words refer to
handing the object to the other person with one's own hands; (2) giving
something when it is really needed; and (3) performing the actual deed in a
way that does no harm to anyone else. Examples would be where one had
stolen the object from someone else in the first place, or where one presented
a sheep to a butcher. Included here too are cases where the object given hurt
the recipient--examples would be giving someone poison or unhealthy food.

Concerning the consequences of such giving, the person has performed his
charity with an attitude of respect and so on, as listed above. As a result he
gains the following (and here the list follows the three numbers above). In his
future life he wins (1) the honor and respect of those who follow him, as well
as a wealth of material things (which because of his former faith he enjoys at
his total discretion). In this next life he also gains (2) the timely fulfillment of
his own needs, as well as (3) complete freedom from any hindrances to his
wealth: enemies, loss of his things in a fire, and so on.

An excellent color "and such"--which refers to an excellent smell, or taste, or

From "it" (that is, from giving things with an excellent color), one gains an
excellent bodily form--at least for the time being. Temporarily too he gains
other results (following the order of the qualities just listed): a good and
widespread reputation; great happiness; and a body with a very youthful
complexion. The body that one possesses is moreover like that which belongs
to the "jewel of the queen": it is pleasant to touch in each of the
times--whether the temperature is just normal, or whether it is cold (when the
queen's body gives you warmth), or hot (at which time the queen feels to you
cool).

To the sick, a spiritual teacher, or
A bodhisattva in his final life

Those to whom you give a gift can be exceptional by virtue of four different
reasons, first by the type of being involved. As Gautami's Sutra states,

Ananda, you can look forward to a hundredfold result
ripening back to you, if you give something to an
individual who has reached the animal's state of birth.
But you can look forward to a thousandfold result if
you give something even to a human who's immoral.

The object towards whom you perform your giving may also be distinguished
by his suffering. Suppose for example that you take all the things that a
person can give in one of those types of acts where the merit derives from a
substantial thing. It is stated that if you give these things to a sick person, or
to someone nursing a sick person, or to someone when it's cold outside or
whatever, the merit is immeasurable.

PHA MA DANG PHAN 'DOGS PA GZHAN YANG RUNG STE, DOM DANG RI DAGS RU RU LA SOGS PA'I SKYES RABS LTA BU RANG LA PHAN 'DOGS PA DANG ,
The recipient may furthermore be distinguished by the aid he has given one
in the past. Here we include one's father and mother, or anyone else who has
been of special help to one. Examples may be found among stories of the
Buddha's former lives, such as the one about the bear and the ru-ru deer.

'GO'U TA MI'I MDO LAS, TSUL KHRIMS DANG LDAN PA LA BYIN NA RNAM PAR SMIN PA 'BUM 'GYUR DU RE BAR BYA'O, , RGYUN DU ZHUGS PA'I 'BRAS BU LA ZHUGS PA LA BYIN NA RNAM PAR SMIN PA TSAD MED DO, , DE BAS KYANG RGYUN DU ZHUGS PA LA BYIN NA CHES TSAD MED DO, , ZHES PA LTA BU YON TAN DANG LDAN PA STE, BZHI PO DE RNAMS KYIS ZHING KHYOD PAR DU 'PHAGS SO,
The person to whom one gives his gift may, lastly, be exceptional by virtue of
his good qualities. Gautami's Sutra provides some examples:

If you give to someone who has kept his morality, you
can expect it to ripen into a result a hundred thousand
times as great. If you give to someone who has
entered that stage known as the "result of entering the
stream," it ripens into something which is
immeasurable. And if you give even more to
someone who has entered the stream, the result is
even more immeasurable.

,SBYIN PA THAMS CAD KYI NANG NAS MCHOG TU GYUR PA NI, GNYIS KA MCHOG YIN PAS KHAMS GSUM LAS GROL BAS GROL BA LA BYIN PA STE, 'GO'U TA MI'I MDO LAS, GANG ZHIG LUS NGAG BSDAMS BDAG NYID, , LAG BRKYANG BSOD SNYOMS SPYOD PA YI, , 'DOD CHAGS BRAL LA CHAGS BRAL BAS, BYIN NA ZANG ZING SBYIN PA'I MCHOG, CES GSUNGS SO,
Now the highest kind of giving is for someone who has freed himself of the
three realms to give something to someone else who has freed himself as well.
This is because both are the highest kind of individual. Again we see, in
Gautami's Sutra,
The highest form of giving a physical thing
Is by one free to another free of desire:
But one with his body and speech restrained,
Reaching out his hand to offer food.

We can also though take a giver who is a bodhisattva and who gives any
object at all, for the sake of helping every being alive. Although this is an act
of giving by a person who is not yet freed and is directed to another person
not yet freed, it is still the highest kind of giving. This is because the act has
been performed for the sake of total enlightenment and every living being.

And this is because one has given something in order to become the savior of
every single being.

Now a certain sutra gives the following list of eight types of giving:
1) Giving to close ones;
2) Giving out of fear;
3) Giving because they gave to you;
4) Giving because they will give to you;
5) Giving because one's parents and ancestors used to give;
6) Giving with the hope of attaining one of the higher births;
7) Giving to gain fame;
8) Giving to gain the jewel of the mind, to gain the riches of the
mind, to win what great practitioners collect together, to achieve
the ultimate goal.

,ZHES SBYIN PA BRGYAD GSUNGS PA'I NANG NAS NI BRGYAD PA SEMS KYI RGYAN LA SOGS PA'I PHYIR SBYIN PA MCHOG 
We can alternately describe the highest type of giving as the eighth in this list:
giving to gain the jewel of the mind and so on.

'DIS SNGON BDAG LA BYIN NO SNYAM NAS SBYIN PA'O,
As for the meaning of the expression "giving to close ones," certain masters of
the past have claimed that it refers to giving to someone when they are
standing close by, or to someone when they approach close by. "Giving out
of fear" means that a person decides he will give the best he has, but only
because he perceives some great imminent danger to himself. And "giving
because they gave to you" refers to giving something to a person with the
thought that "I'm doing this because he gave me something before."

The remaining members of the list are easily understood. "Jewel of the mind"
refers to the ability to perform miracles, while "riches of the mind" refers to the
eight parts of the path of realized beings. "What great practitioners collect
together" refers to perfectly tranquil concentration and special realization. The
"ultimate goal" can be described as achieving the state of an enemy destroyer,
or the state of nirvana. This is how the Master Jinaputra explains the various
types of giving.

Master Purna explains them as follows:
Giving to gain the "jewel of the mind" and the rest of
the four refers respectively to (1) that which brings
one the riches of faith and the rest; (2) that which is
totally inconsistent with the stink of stinginess; (3) that
which makes the happiness of balanced meditation
grow; and (4) that which brings on the state of
nirvana.

These four have also been accepted as relating respectively to the four "results
of the way of virtue," or to (1) the paths of collection and preparation, (2) the
path of seeing, (3) the path of habituation, and (4) nirvana. An alternate way
is to correlate them with (1) the paths of collection and preparation, (2) the
seven impure levels, (3) the three pure levels, and (4) the level of a Buddha.

Beyond the above, we can say that there are other acts of giving where, even
though the recipient is not a realized being, the resulting merit still cannot be
measured in units such as a "hundred thousand times greater" or such. These
would involve gifts made to one's father or mother (recipients who had given
one great aid), to the sick (recipients who are in a state of suffering), to a
spiritual teacher, or to a bodhisattva in his final life.

Support for this description can be found in the Sutra on Causes and Effect of
Right and Wrong, which equates the merit of giving to these objects with the
amount of merit you collect from giving something to the Buddha himself:

Moreover, the act of giving performed towards any
one of the three different kinds of individuals ripens
into a result which never reaches an end at all. These
objects are the One Thus Gone, a person's parents, and
the sick.

Severity of Deeds
according to Six Factors

,MJUG DANG ZHING DANG GZHI DANG NI,
,SBYOR DANG SEMS PA BSAM PA STE,
,DE DAG CHUNG DANG CHE BA LAS,
,LAS KYANG CHUNG DANG CHE BA NYID,
Conclusion, one who's acted toward, commission;
Undertaking, thinking, and intention:
The power of the deed itself's exactly
As little or great as these happen to be.
[IV.473-6]

,ZHAR LA CI YANG BSHAD PA NI, MJUG TU BYED PAS CHE BA NI LAS KYI LAM DNGOS KYI RJES LA RGYUN TU BYED PA DANG ,
Here we might touch by the way on what determines how serious a given
deed will be. The first factor that can make a deed serious is what we call
"performance in conclusion," which means to continue a particular act well
after the original course of action.

ZHING GIS CHE BA NI PHAN 'DOGS PA DANG , GZHIS CHE BA NI LUS KYI LAS LA SROG GCOD PA DANG , NGAG GI LAS LA RDZUN DANG , YID KYI LAS LA LOG LTA CHE BA LA SOGS PA DANG , SROG GCOD PA'ANG CHEN PO NI DGRA BCOM PA GSOD PA LA SOGS PA STE, MNAR MED

The one who's acted toward in any particular deed--someone who may have
lent one great aid in the past--is also a factor in making the deed a serious
one. Deeds which are more serious because of the basic type involved in the
actual commission of the act would include cases like killing (among the
different deeds of the body), lying (among the deeds of speech), and mistaken
views (among the deeds of thought). Even among the different types of killing
there are those which are more serious--killing an enemy destroyer, for
example--because as Close Recollection states,
...it leads one to the lowest hell, "Without Respite." A less serious
type of killing would be to take the life of a person who had
reached any of the paths. And the least serious type would be to
kill an animal, or a very immoral person.

,SBYOR BAS CHE BA NI LUS NGAG GIS DNGOS SU SBYOR BA DANG , SEMS PAS CHE BA NA RDZOGS PAR BYED PA'I SEMS PA CHE BA DANG , BSAM PAS CHE BA NI KUN SLONG GI BSAM PA CHE BA STE,
Deeds made serious by the stage of their preliminary undertaking would be
those which involved actually applying oneself physically or verbally. Deeds
made serious by the thinking involved would be those where one's thoughts
in carrying out the act were particularly strong. And deeds which turn more
serious because of the intention involved would be those where one
undertakes an act with particularly strong thoughts of motivation.

DE LTAR NA MJUG LA SOGS PA DRUG PO DE DAG CHUNG BA DANG CHE BA LAS, LAS KYANG CHUNG BA DANG CHE BAR 'GYUR BA NYID DO, , RNAM PA DRUG KA TSANG NA SHIN TU LCI BA'I LAS SU SHES SO,
We can summarize by saying that the power of the deed itself is exactly as
little or great as these six factors of conclusion and the rest happen to be in
their own force. One should understand that deeds where all six factors are
present in force are extremely serious.

Whether Deeds are Collected or Not

A deed is called "collected" from its being
Done intentionally, to its completion,
Without regret, without a counteraction,
With attendants, ripening as well.
[IV.477-80]

,YANG MDO LAS, LAS BYAS LA BSAGS BA DANG , LAS BYAS LA BSAGS PA MIN PA SOGS GSUNGS NA, DE DAG JI LTA BU ZHE NA,
Now sutra also mentions a number of concepts including "deeds which are
done and also collected" as well as "deeds which are done but which are not
collected." One may ask just what these are.

A deed is called "done and also collected" from its being done with six
different conditions, described as follows:
1) The deed must be done intentionally; that is, it
cannot have been performed without premeditation,
or simply on the spur of the moment.

2) It must have been done "to its
completion"--meaning with all the various
elements of a complete deed present.
3) The person who committed the deed must feel no
regret later on.
4) There must be no counteraction to work against the
force of the deed.
5) The deed must come along with the necessary
attendants.
6) The deed must as well be one of those where one
is certain to experience the ripening of a result in
the future.

LAS GZHAN NI BYAS LA BSAGS PA MIN PA'I LAS ZHES BYA'O, , DE BZHIN DU BSAGS LA MA BYAS PA DANG , GNYIS KA MIN PA'ANG SHES PAR BYA'O,
Deeds other than the type described are what we call "done but not collected."
From this one can understand what kinds of deeds are meant by the
expressions "collected but not done" and "neither done nor collected."

,DE LA RDZOGS PA NI LAS KHA CIG NI NYES SPYAD DANG LEGS SPYAD GCIG GIS NGAN 'GRO DANG BDE 'GROR 'GRO LA, KHA CIG NI SGO GSUM GYI LAS BCU CAR GYIS NGAN 'GRO DANG BDE 'GROR 'GRO BA YOD DE, DE NI LAS DAG RDZOGS PAR BYAS PA'O,
As for the phrase "to its completion," in some cases a single act of right or
wrong leads one to a birth in the states of misery or to a birth in the happier
states. In other cases, all ten deeds of all three doors lead a person to the
appropriate one of these two births. In either case the deeds have been done
to their completion.

,GNYEN PO MED PA NI LOG LTA DANG 'GYOD PA LA SOGS PA DANG , BSHAGS PA DANG SDOM PA LA SOGS PA MED PA'O,
The phrase "without a counteraction" refers to deeds done (1) with mistaken
ideas, misgivings, or the like; (2) without confession, future restraint, or such.
 , 'KHOR NI DGE MI DGE'I LAS LA 'KHOR YANG DGE BA DANG MI DGE BA STE, GANG ZHIG BYAS NA RJES SU YI RANG BAR BYED PA'O ZHES t'AI K'AR BSHAD MOD, 'DIR NI 'KHOR SBYOR MJUG GNYIS KA YIN NO,
A deed "along with its necessary attendants" means a deed of virtue or non-
virtue along with attendants of further virtue or non-virtue. Admittedly, the
Commentary does explains these as "Any deed which you rejoice about having
done." Nonetheless the attendants here are the preliminary undertaking and
final conclusion stages of the deed.
