The second section in our explanation of the wish to achieve enlightenment for
every living being describes how to develop this wish. As the next two verses
say,
(7,8)
They're swept along on four fierce river currents,
Chained up tight in past deeds, hard to undo,
Stuffed in a steel cage of grasping "self,"
Smothered in the pitch-black ignorance.
In a limitless round they're born, and in their births
Are tortured by three sufferings without a break;
Think how your mothers feel, think of what's happening
To them: try to develop this highest wish.

We may begin with another pair of verses, from The Bodhisattva's Life:

Even just wishing you could stop
A headache another person has
Can bring you merit without measure
Because of the helpful intent you feel.
What need then to mention the wish
That you could stop the immeasurable pain
Of every being, and put every one
In a state of measureless happiness?

To take on some kind of physical form

And then spill over farther still.

The benefits of this wish to achieve enlightenment for all living beings are thus
described, in these and other texts, as limitless. And so here are the mass of
living beings, all of them our mothers, swept along the flow of four river
currents, all fierce suffering. From one viewpoint, while they are acting as
causes, these four are the torrent of desire, the torrent of views, the torrent of
the ripe force of deeds, and the torrent of ignorance. Later, when they serve as
results, they are the four torrents of birth, and aging, and illness, and death.

CHU BO'I RGYUN DE'I NANG DU KHYER YANG RKANG LAG RNAMS THAG PAS BSDAMS PA LTAR BZLOG DKA' BA LAS KYI ZHAGS PA'AM 'CHING BAS DAM POR BSDAMS,
And these mother beings are not just hurtling along in these four great rivers;
it's just as if their hands and feet too were bound fast--they are chained up
tight, they are snared, in their own past deeds, hard to undo.

But that's not all; the bonds which hold them tight are no regular ties, like our
twined ropes of yak-skin or hair. It's more like our mothers are clasped in
fetters of iron, ever so hard to sever, ever so hard to unshackle--for while they
are swept along they are stuffed in a steel cage of grasping to some
non-existent "self."

And there's more. If there were some daylight, these mother beings would
have some glimmer of hope--they could at least cry out, and try to get some
help. But it is night, and the darkest hour of the night, and in pitch-black dark
they are swept downstream the mighty river: they are smothered completely
in pitch-black ignorance.

In a limitless round, in an endless round, they are born into the ocean of life,
and in these births they are tortured by three different kinds of suffering: the
suffering of suffering, the suffering of change, and the all-pervading suffering.
And their torture comes to them without a break--it is always there.

This is what's happening to them, to our mother beings, this is their situation:
unbearable pain. There's nothing they can do like this to help themselves; the
son though has a chance at hand to pull his mother free. He must find a way,
and find it now, to grasp her hand and draw her out. And the way he must
try is to develop this jewel wish for enlightenment: he must do so first by
thinking how his mothers feel, tortured by pain; then by deciding to take
personal responsibility, the duty of freeing them, upon himself; and so on, all
in the proper stages.

To actually gain the wish for enlightenment he must first contemplate it. To
contemplate it, he must first learn about it from another. "Loving-kindness" is
an almost obsessive desire that each and every living being find happiness.
"Compassion" is an almost obsessive desire that they be free of any pain.
Think of how a mother feels when her one and only and most beloved son is

in the throes of a serious illness. Wherever she goes, whatever she does, she
is always thinking how wonderful it would be if she could find some way of
freeing him quickly from his sickness. These thoughts come to her mind in a
steady stream, without a break, and all of their own, automatically. They
become an obsession with her. When we feel this way towards every living
being, and only then, we can say we have gained what they call "great
compassion."

Here in the teachings of the Buddha there are two methods given for training
one's mind in this precious jewel, the wish for enlightenment. The first is
known as the "seven-part, cause-and-effect instruction." The second we call
"exchanging self and others." No matter which of the two you use to train
your mind, you can definitely gain the wish for enlightenment. The way to
train oneself in the wish, the way which is complete and which never errs, the
way unmatched by any other here upon this earth, is the instruction of the
Steps of the path to Buddhahood, the very essence of all the teachings of our
gentle protector, the great Tsongkapa. Thus you should train your mind in the
wish for enlightenment by using this very instruction.

Here we'll give just a brief summary of how one trains himself in the wish to
achieve enlightenment for every living being. The start-off is to practice

feelings of neutrality towards all beings; after that, one begins meditation on
each of the steps from "mother recognition" on up. The first three steps are to
recognize all beings as one's mothers, to feel gratitude for their kindness, and
to wish to repay that kindness. These three act as a cause for what we call
"beautiful" loving-kindness. This type of loving-kindness is itself the fourth
step; it is both an effect brought about by the first three, and a cause for the
fifth: great compassion.

The relative intensity of one's wish for enlightenment depends on the intensity
of one's feeling of great compassion. If you find it difficult to develop
compassion, you can practice the meditation known as "Lama Loving-Gaze" to
help you gain it. If you make good efforts to perform this meditation and the
proper supplications, as well as the practice where you visualize that your
mind and that of Loving-Gaze are mixed inseparably, then you can gain a
blessing for it. This is a very special personal instruction for developing great
compassion. There were, our Lama explained, a number of other profound
points in this regard--but he would not detail them in a public gathering.

SNYING RJE CHEN PO SKYES PA NA GZHAN DON KHUR DU 'KHYER BA'I LHAG BSAM SKYE, DE LAS BYANG CHUB KYI SEMS SKYE BA YIN,
Once you develop great compassion, then you can develop the extraordinary
form of personal responsibility, where you take upon yourself the load of
working for others' benefit. And the wish to achieve enlightenment for every
living being comes from this.

The meditation on neutrality goes like this. First you put your thoughts in an
even state, free of feelings of like and dislike, by thinking about someone who
is for you a neutral figure: neither your enemy nor your friend. Then you
imagine that two people are sitting before you: one of your best-loved friends,
and one of your ugliest enemies. Next you think very carefully about how the
friend has, in many of your previous lives, taken birth as your enemy and hurt
you. You think too about how the enemy has, in so many of your past lives,
taken birth as your friend and helped you. This puts your mind in the even
state, free of feelings of like and dislike.

You go on then to think about how all living beings are equal in that, from his
own point of view, each one of them wants to be happy. They are equal too
in not wanting pain. And they are equal in that every one has acted as both
my enemy and my friend, many many times. So who am I supposed to like?
And who am I supposed to dislike? You have to keep on practicing this way
until, one day, you gain neutral feelings towards all sentient beings, as vast in
extent as space itself.

The next step is the meditation where you recognize that every living being is
your mother. Gaining this recognition is much easier if you apply the line of
reasoning mentioned in the Commentary on Valid Perception for demonstrating
the infinite regression of one's awareness. We'll present this reasoning here,
in brief.

Your awareness of today is a mental continuation of the awareness you had
yesterday. This year's awareness is a mental continuation of the awareness
you had the year before. Just so, your awareness over this entire life is a
mental continuation of the awareness you had in your former life. The
awareness you had in your former life was, in turn, a mental continuation of
the awareness you had in the life before that. You can continue back in a
regression like this and absolutely never reach some point where you can say,
"Prior to this, I had no awareness." This then proves the infinite regression of
one's awareness.

My own circle of life then must also be beginningless, and the births I have
taken as well can have no starting point. There exists no place where I have
never taken birth. I have taken birth in every single place, countless times.
There exists no creature whose body I have not worn. I have worn every kind
of body, countless times. Just the lives I have taken as a dog are themselves
beyond any number to count. And the same is true for every living being.

Therefore there exists no being who has never been my mother. Absolutely
every single one of them has been my mother a countless number of times.
Even the number of times that each has been my mother in just my births as
a human is past all counting too.

Developing a sense of gratitude is the next step, and you can start by taking
your mother in this present life. She began her hardships for me while I was
still in her womb, gladly taking it upon herself to avoid anything she felt might
hurt me--even down to the food she ate--treating herself with care, as though
she were sick. For nine months and ten days she carried me in her womb,
looking at her own body as though it belonged to someone else, someone very
ill, and hesitating even to take big steps.

As she gave me birth, my mother was torn with violent suffering, excruciating
pain, and yet still felt an overwhelming joy, as though she had discovered
some precious gem that would grant her any wish.

Right then I knew absolutely nothing more than to cry and wave my arms
around somehow. I was totally helpless. Totally stupid. Incapacitated.
Nothing more than some baby chick with a red-rubber beak still yet to harden.
But she swayed me on her fingertips, and pressed me to her body's warmth,
and greeted me with a smile of love.

With joyful eyes she gazed on me, and wiped the snot from my face with her
lips, and cleaned my filthy shit with her hands. Sometimes she chewed my
food for me, and fed me things like milky porridge straight from her mouth
to mine. She did her best to protect me from any hurt. She did her best to get
me any good.

In those days I had to look to her for everything; good or bad, happy or sad,
all the hope I could have lay in one person: mother. But for her kindness, I
wouldn't have lasted an hour; they could have set me out in the open right
then and some birds or a dog would have come and made a meal of me--I'd
have no hope of coming out alive. Every single day she protected me from
harms that could have taken my life, no less than a hundred times. Such was
her kindness.

And while I was growing up she gathered together whatever I needed,
avoiding no bad deed, and no suffering, and caring nothing for what other
people might say of her. All the money and things she had she handed over

For those of us who are fortunate enough to be practicing the monastic life, it
was mother who put forth all the necessary expenses, giving without
reservation, to arrange our admission into the monastery. And from that time
on she supported us here, from whatever resources she had. Thus the kindness
she has shown us is truly without measure.

And this is not the only life in which my present mother has given this
kindness to me. She has showered me with this kindness, great kindness, over
and over, countless times, in my many lives before. And she is not the only
one; every single living being has been my mother in my past lives, and during
those lives cared for me no less than my present mother does--it is only my
transitions from death to birth that prevent me from recognizing all these
mothers now.

Look now, concluded our Lama, at the way any common animal--a dog or
bird, even the tiny sparrow--shows affection for its young, and cares for it
well. From watching this we can imagine what kindness we were given too.

The next step in gaining the wish for enlightenment is to develop a wish to
repay this great kindness. So every living being is my mother, and has given
me her loving care over and over endlessly, for time with no beginning. And
we know from what was described above that they are being swept along by
four great currents, out to sea--to the vast expanse of the ocean of cyclic life.
They are tormented, without a break, by the three types of suffering, and all
the other pains. Their situation is desperate.

And here am I, their child. Right now I have a chance to rescue them from
this ocean of cyclic life. Suppose I simply sit and bide my time, and give no
thought to them. This is the lowest a person could stoop--base and absolutely
shameless.

Right now I could give them things that they would be happy to get--food, or
clothes, or beds to sleep on, whatever. But these are only some temporary
happiness within the circle of life. The very highest way of repaying their
kindness would be to put them into the state of ultimate happiness. So let me
decide within myself that every living being must come to have every
happiness. And every one should be freed as well from every form of pain.

Right now it's absurd to say that these beings have any kind of pure
happiness--they don't even have any of the impure kinds. Every single thing

they think is happiness is, in its essence, nothing more than pain. They want
wantables but don't want to know about doing the good deeds that bring
happiness. They want no unwantables but don't want to know about giving
up the bad deeds that bring pain. They act ass backwards: they do what they
shouldn't and don't what they should. And so my dear aged mothers, these
living beings, are made to suffer.
"How good it would be if they could all find every happiness,
and every cause of happiness.
I wish they could. I'll see that they do."
"How good it would be if they could all be free of every pain,
and every cause of pain.
I wish they could. I'll see that they do."
Let these two trains of thought run through your mind; meditate on them over
and over again. Then you will come to feel the very strongest loving-kindness
and compassion.

Some people might come up with the idea that "Why should I take upon
myself this great load, of every living being? There are plenty of Buddhas and
bodhisattvas around to guide them on their way." This kind of thought though
is absolutely improper. It's base. It's shameless. It's as if your mother in this
life was hungry, and parched, and you expected someone else's child to go and
give her food and drink. But it's you for whom she has cared, and the
responsibility of paying her back has fallen only to you.

It's the same with all these living beings, who for beginningless time have
served as my mother so many times, and who in each of these times cared for
me in every way with the kindness of this present mother. Returning their
kindness is no business of anyone else at all, not for some Buddha or
bodhisattva--it is my responsibility, and only mine.

So someone is going to do it--to make sure every sentient being has every
happiness, and never a single pain. It is going to be myself; I'll rely on no one
else. I by myself will see to it that every single being comes to have every
single happiness. And I by myself will see to it that every single being gets
free of every single pain. I will by myself put them into the state of the Lama,
the state of Buddhahood. Meditate strongly on these thoughts; they are the
step we call the "extraordinary form of personal responsibility."

I may be able to develop this noble intention, but the fact is that I'm
completely incapable of leading a single being to Buddhahood--much less
every one of them. Who then has the capacity? This power is had by a fully
enlightened Buddha--only by him, and by no one else at all. If I can reach the
same state, I will by definition have brought both mine and others' benefit to
its perfection. And then every single ray of light that emanates from me,
whether it be an action of my body, or my speech, or my thoughts, will have
the power to accomplish the ends of countless sentient beings.

And so, for the sake of every living being, I will do anything I can to achieve
this one great goal--the state of a Buddha--with every speed. Think this way
to yourself, and do anything you can to develop the genuine wish to reach
enlightenment for every living being.

While you practice these meditations to develop the wish for enlightenment,
you can also reflect that--when you achieve Buddhahood--you will by the
way automatically gain everything you need for yourself as well. Our Lama
mentioned that this point was stated in Lord Tsongkapa's exposition on the
Steps of the path as being very helpful in preventing a person from slipping
to the lesser way.

The first three of the seven parts in this cause-and-effect instruction provide a
foundation for great compassion. The "beautiful" form of loving-kindness
comes out as a result of these three, so there is no separate meditation
instruction for it. One must though in its place meditate upon the
loving-kindness where you wish that every being gain every happiness.

This loving-kindness, as well as compassion and the extraordinary type of
personal responsibility, are all forms of an attitude of striving for the welfare
of others. The actual wish for enlightenment is their result. The works on the
Steps of the path themselves have a similar structure. The paths for people of
lesser and medium scopes represent a preliminary to developing the wish for
enlightenment. The teaching on how to meditate on this great wish is the main
stage. In conclusion then come the sections on bodhisattva deeds--advices in
acting out the wish.

the twenty-two forms of the wish, the distinction between praying and actually
engaging, and so on.

This precious jewel, the wish to gain enlightenment for every being, is the
inner essence of all the high teachings of the victorious Buddhas. It is the
single centermost contemplation of every one of their sons--the bodhisattvas.
As The Bodhisattva's Life relates,
It's the purest essence of the butter
Churned from the milk of the holy word.
We see too,
Many eons the Able Lords considered,
And found but this to be of benefit.
Our gentle protector, the great Tsongkapa, has as well composed the lines that
begin with "Center beam of the highest way, the wish..." and conclude with
"...Bodhisattva princes, knowing this, / Keep the high jewel wish their center
practice." It was only this precious wish for enlightenment, and nothing else
at all, that the all-knowing Lord ever described as the "center practice."
Therefore those of us who wish to become followers of the greater way must
make the wish for enlightenment our very centermost practice.

Nowadays when you go up to someone and ask him what his very most
important practice is, he'll tell you he's meditating on one of those powerful
tutelary deities. You don't meet people who say their chief practice is
meditating on the wish to achieve enlightenment for every living being. Much
less, for in fact it's quite difficult to find anyone who even realizes that he
should make this wish his centermost practice.

We see people making all different sorts of things their central practice: the

Sheep Spell, the Horse Spell, the Money Spell, the ritual for No More Problems,
the ritual for Stopping Bad Luck at the End of the Twelve-Year Cycle, the ritual
for Preventing the Praise that Others Give You from Turning to a Curse, and
on and on. These are all so bad that they make it look pretty good when a
person can say he's making a central practice out of anything at all associated
with some authentic tutelary deity.

We also see a number of works gaining some popularity in different localities
that seem to be just anything somebody could think up: the String of Jewels

for those Bound by Blood, the Blade of Gold for Confessing Sins, the so-called
"Dog Sutra," the so-called "Wolf Sutra," the so-called "Fox Sutra," the so-called
"Bear Sutra," the so-called "Snake Sutra," and all the rest. We find though
absolutely no legitimate origin for any of these works.

If you really do need a text to use for confessing your bad deeds, you should
stop wasting your time with fake scriptures and meaningless efforts like these.
The Victors have, in all their open and secret teachings, given us more than
enough appropriate works: the Three Heaps Sutra, the Sublime Medicine Sutra,
the Sutra of the Great Freedom, the Sutra of the Eon of Fortune, and others of the
like. It is texts like these, our Lama told us, authoritative texts with a
legitimate origin, that we must use for our study and recitations.

Now there are also some people around who think to themselves, "But I do
have the wish for enlightenment. After all, at the beginning of all my devotions
I recite the 'Buddha-Dharma-Sangha' prayer and think about achieving
Buddhahood so I could help every living being." This though is just

expressing a hope that you gain the wish for enlightenment--it's just making
a prayer about the wish. It's not the actual wish itself. If it were, then
developing the wish to achieve Buddhahood would have to be the very easiest
of all the many practices of virtue we are supposedly trying to do. And so,
concluded our Lama, we must rather gain this true wish by putting our minds
through the training described above--one by one through each of the steps,
in order.

The Asian Classics Institute
Course VII: The Vows of the Bodhisattva
Reading Two: Types and Features of Morality
A. On the three sets of vows
The following selection is taken from the Highway for Bodhisattvas by Je Tsongkapa
(1357-1419), folios 527-528.

BYANG SEMS KYI SDOM PA SHI 'PHOS KYANG MI GTONG BAS GANG DU SKYES KYANG CHOS NYID KYIS THOB PA'I TSUL KHRIMS YOD PAR 'CHAD DO, , SPYIR BYANG SEMS KYI SDOM PA SHI 'PHOS KYANG RJES SU 'BRANG BAS 'GRO BA GSUM GA NA YOD PA 'THAD LA, KHYIM PA DANG RAB BYUNG GI PHYOGS GNYIS SU 'BYED PA NI DGE TSUL LA SOGS PA RAB BYUNG SDE LNGA'I SDOM PA DANG LDAN PA DANG MI LDAN PA'I BYANG SEMS KYI DBANG DU BYAS PA YIN NO,
Even when you die and move to your next birth, you do not lose your
bodhisattva vows. Thus the texts speak of bodhisattva vows which you attain
"naturally." It is, generally speaking, correct that these vows are had among
all three types of beings, since they follow along with you even after you die
and move on. Nonetheless when we split the vows into categories we divide
them into one or another of only two types: those possessed by laypeople and
those possessed by those who have left the home life. This division is made
according to whether or not the particular bodhisattva has the vows of the five
types of practitioners who have left the home life: novice monks and so on.

,RANG BZHIN GYI DBYE BA NI PHYOGS GNYIS LA BRTEN PA'I TSUL KHRIMS DE YANG MDOR BSDU NA, SDOM PA DANG DGE BA'I CHOS SDUD PA DANG SEMS CAN LA PHAN 'DOGS PA'I TSUL 
KHRIMS GSUM STE, BYANGS SEMS KYIS BSRUNG BAR BYA BA'I TSUL KHRIMS THAMS CAD NI GSUM PO 'DIR 'DUS PA'I PHYIR RO,
A division by basic nature for the morality had by people of both these
categories can also be made, succinctly, into three further types: the morality
of restraint, the morality of collecting goodness, and the morality of working
for all living beings. This is because every sort of morality that any
bodhisattva ever has to practice is included into these three.

,CI'I PHYIR TSUL KHRIMS GSUM DU BYAS SHE NA, NYAN THOS KYI THEG PA LA NYON MONGS RTZE 'JIL BA'I SO THAR DANG RKYEN YOD KYANG RE ZHIG MI LDANG BA'I BSAM GTAN GYI SDOM PA DANG , RGYUN GCOD PA'I ZAG MED KYI SDOM PA GSUM YOD PA DANG GRANGS MTHUN PAR BYAS PA'O ZHES 'GREL PA RNAMS LAS 'CHAD MOD KYANG ,
"Why is it," one may ask, "that you make this division into three different types
of morality?" Admittedly there are commentaries which explain that this
division into three is meant to coincide with the division made in the way of
the listeners, where the vows are described as three:
1) The vows of individual freedom, which function to take the soften the
mental afflictions;
2) The vows of meditation, where given the right circumstances the
mental afflictions could still arise but don't for the time being, since one
is in a state of meditation; and
3) The unstained vows, where the mental afflictions are discontinued
completely.

BYANG SEMS KYI BYA BA NI GNYIS SU ZAD DE, RANG GI RGYUD DANG GZHAN GYI RGYUD SMIN PAR BYED PA'O, , DANG PO LA NYES SPYOD SPONG BA DANG LEGS SPYAD BSDU BA GNYIS SU NGES PAS SDOM PA DANG DGE BA CHOS SDUD GNYIS YIN LA, GZHAN SMIN PAR BYED PA LA SEMS CAN DON BYED KYI TSUL KHRIMS DGOS PA'I PHYIR GSUM DU NGES SO ZHES BSHAD NA LEGS SO,
The activities of a bodhisattva though are limited to two: trying to ripen one's
own mental stream, and trying to ripen the mental streams of other beings. To
accomplish the former, there are only two types of activities, no more and no
less: giving up improper behavior, and accumulating good behavior. These are
represented by two kinds of morality: the morality of restraining oneself, and
the morality of collecting goodness. For ripening the minds of others, you
need then the morality of working for the good of all living beings. As such
there are precisely three types of morality. This is an excellent way of
explaining the point.

,CI'I PHYIR TSUL KHRIMS GSUM GYI GO RIMS DE LTAR NGES SHE NA, NYAN THOS DANG THUN MONG BA SPONG BA'I TSUL KHRIMS NI PHYI MA GNYIS KYI RGYU DANG THUN MONG MA YIN PA 'JUG PA'I TSUL KHRIMS NI, BDAG MA GROL BAS GZHAN SGROL BAR MI RIGS BDAG MA ZHI BAS GZHAN ZHI BAR MI 'GYUR ZHES GSUNGS PAS DGE BA SDUD PA DANG POR MA BYAS NA SEMS CAN GYI DON BYED PAR MI 'GYUR BAS RIM PA NGES PAR SA MU DRA ME GUS BYAS ZER BA'I 'GREL PAR BSHAD PA LTAR 'THAD DO,
"Why," one may continue, "is the order of the three types of morality fixed that
way?" The morality of giving up improper behavior, which is shared with
those of the listener way, is a cause that leads into the latter two types. As for
the types of morality which are not shared with this way, you could hardly
work for the sake of all other beings if you hadn't yet accomplished collecting
goodness for yourself; as the text says,
You can hardly free others
Before you free yourself;
You can hardly bring others to peace
Before you reach peace yourself.
This is how the order is explained in the commentary said to have been
authored by Samudra Megha, and the explanation is correct.

,RANG BZHIN LA GSUM LAS, SDOM PA'I TSUL KHRIMS NI, SO THAR GYI SDOM PA RIS BDUN PO STE DE YANG DGE SLONG PHA MA DANG DGE SLOB MA DANG DGE TSUL PHA MA'I TSUL KHRIMS 
NI RAB BYUNG GI PHYOGS DANG DGE BSNYEN PHA MA'I TSUL KHRIMS NI KHYIMS PA'I PHYOGS YIN NO,
Here next is the basic nature of each of these three kinds of morality. The first
is the morality of restraining oneself, and it consists of the seven different types
of freedom vows. These are first of all the morality observed by a full monk
or full nun, an intermediate nun, and a novice monk or novice nun for the
category of those who have left the home life. For the layman category, there
are the lifetime layman's vows of a man or woman.

There are actually eight different types of freedom vows. The reason that the
one-day vow is not mentioned in this context can be understood as explained
in the Commentary on the Difficult Points in the Twenty Verses on Vows, which
says:
Consider the one which you uphold for only a single day. It is not
mentioned in this regard because it doesn't really fit: it does not involve
the hardship and is not removed from desire, and it does not continue
on for any extended length of time.
B. On the three kinds of morality
The following selection is taken from the Commentary to the Source of All My
Good, an explanation by Pabongka Rinpoche (1878-1941) of the famed root verses of
Je Tsongkapa, ff. 18A-18B.

Verse 8:
Bless me to see clearly

Is not enough,
For if I'm not well trained
In the three moralities,
I cannot become a Buddha.
Grant me then
A fierce resolve
To master the vows

Suppose you are able, as described above, to reach the Wish for enlightenment,
where you truly hope to achieve the state of a Buddha in order to help every
living being. This itself is not enough. Once you do reach the Wish, you must
still take on the vows of these bodhisattva princes and princesses, these sons
and daughters of the victorious Buddhas. And then you must train yourself
in giving and the other five perfections. Otherwise there is no way you could
ever come to enlightenment.

DES NA 'DIR PHAR PHYIN DRUG TSUL KHRIMS RNAM PA GSUM DU BSDUS TE GSUNGS PA HA CANG GNAD CHE STE,
This fact explains why it is so very important when holy beings have said that
all six perfections are covered in the three types of morality.

SPYIR SER SKYA GANG YIN YANG NGES PAR BSRUNG DGOS PA'I BSRUNG BYA THUN MONG BA MI DGE BCU SPONG GI TSUL KHRIMS LEGS PAR BSRUNG BA'I THOG,
The first type is called the "morality of keeping oneself from committing
wrong." Here you begin by being extremely careful to keep the morality of
avoiding the ten bad deeds. This type of good behavior is common to
everyone, whether they wear the robes or not, and must absolutely be
maintained.

More specifically, with this first type of morality, you must in addition exert
yourself to the fullest, so to assure that your life is never sullied in the least by
overstepping the bounds of any of the vows you have agreed to keep. Here
we refer to vows that belong to any of the three traditional sets: the freedom
vows, the bodhisattva vows, and the secret vows.

The second type of morality is known as the "morality of collecting goodness."
This is where you use a great variety of means to gather or collect extremely
potent stores of virtue into your being; these are the virtues of amassing merit
and wisdom.

SNGAR BSHAD PA'I SDOM PA'I TSUL KHRIMS DE RNAMS RANG DON YID BYED KYIS MA BSLAD PAR SEMS CAN THAMS CAD KYI PHYIR RDZOGS BYANG DON DU GNYER BA KHO NA'I CHED DU BSRUNG BA SEMS CAN DON BYED KYI TSUL KHRIMS YIN PAS,
The third type of morality is the "morality that acts for every sentient being."
Here you take care to keep the different varieties of morality mentioned above
that involve restraining yourself from wrong; but instead of doing so with a
motivation which is infected with any self-interest, you act only out of an
intention to reach total Buddhahood for the sake of all living kind.

You must find a sure kind of knowledge where you see clearly how--if you
lack a total fluency in these three types of morality, if you are not well trained
and completely accustomed to following them--then you cannot become one
of those who has reached the fully enlightened state of a Buddha.

Once you have found this knowledge, you must take on the vows for the
"children of the Victors" (that is, the bodhisattva vows), and then with a resolve
of fierce intensity you must learn and master the three types of morality. What
we are requesting of our Lama here, said our Lama, is that he or she grant us
the ability to do so.
C. On the features of morality
The following selections are taken from the Highway for Bodhisattvas, ff. 521 and
524-6. The text is referring to specific passages from the Bodhisattva Levels of
Master Asanga.

TSUL KHRIMS KYI NGO BO NYID GANG ZHE NA, MDOR BSDU NA YON TAN BZHI DANG LDAN PA STE, PHA ROL LAS LEGS PAR YANG DAG PAR BLANGS PA'I YON TAN DANG BSAM PA SHIN TU RNAM PAR DAG PA'I YON TAN DANG , NYAMS NA PHYIR GSO BA'I YON TAN DANG MI NYAMS PAR BYA BA'I PHYIR GUS PA BSKYED NAS DRAN PA NYE BAR GNAS PA'I YON TAN NO,
"What," you may ask, "is the very essence of this morality?" To put it briefly,
it has four wonderful qualities:

1) The morality is accepted from others, in an excellent way; and
2) The motivation for taking it on is extremely pure.
3) If one fails in the morality, one can recover; and
4) One can develop a sense of reverence for the morality, maintain then
a sense of recollection, and thus prevent oneself from failing.

,YON TAN GYI BYED PA NI, PHA ROL LAS BLANGS PAS NI, BSLAB PA LAS NYAMS PA'I RKYEN NYE BA NA GZHAN GYIS SMAD NA MI RUNG NGO SNYAM NAS NYES SPYOD LA 'DZEM PA'I KHREL YOD PA BSKYED DO,
Each one of these wonderful qualities has a specific function. The fact that
vows are taken from other people gives you a sense of shame that allows you
to avoid doing something wrong: when you are close to breaking one of the
precepts, you stop, because you think of how this other person would reproach
you.

,BSAM PA DAG PAS NI, BSLAB PA LAS NYAMS PA'I RKYEN NYE BA NA RANG NGAM RANG GI CHOS RGYU MTSAN DU BYAS NAS NYES SPYOD LA 'DZEM PA'I NGO TSA SHES PA SKYED DO,
The motivation that you have as you take vows gives you a feeling of
conscience that also helps you avoid doing something wrong: when you are
close to breaking one of the precepts, you stop, because of your own sense of
self-respect, for yourself and what you represent.

The two qualities of being able to recover if you fail, and of not failing in the
first place, allow you to live without any regrets. Once you possess the sense
of conscience and of shame that you get from taking the vows in an excellent
way from others and from your pure original motivation, you will be able to

maintain your morality, whether through avoiding any failure in the first place,
or through recovering should you incur some failure. As you continue to
maintain your morality in this way, you observe how free you are from any
downfalls in morality, and can live without any regrets.

Here is how this process is described. Those who have taken the vows from
others should constantly examine their own mental stream with a form of
wisdom that functions in an accurate way. If they see then that they are free
of any kind of downfall, subtle or gross, they can enjoy the feeling of having
no regrets, of realizing that their mental stream is crystal clean.

Here you should make great efforts from the very beginning never to allow
yourself to be sullied by any bad deed at all. If by some remote chance you
forget yourself or something similar, and thus find yourself dirtied by such a
deed, you should never just ignore what happened. You must undertake to
purify yourself, and restrain yourself in the future, and so on.

For this to happen, you have to have the emotions of conscience and shame.
For these to come, certain conditions must be there when you take your vows.
The person you take them from must be a spiritual friend who possesses all
the necessary qualifications. The motivation with which you take the vows
must come from the depths of your heart; you mustn't take them just to follow
the crowd, or for any reason like that. Nor should you take them with any
kind of inferior motivation, such as a fear of death or the like--let your
aspirations be the highest that there are. Put a lot of effort into making the
first two causes right.
**************

TSUL KHRIMS KYI CHE BA LA BZHI, DGE BA DANG , DPAG TU MED PA DANG , PHAN 'DOGS PA DANG , 'BRAS BU DANG PHAN YON CHE BA'O, , DANG PO NI,
There are four kinds of greatness to the practice of morality: these are virtue,
infinity, assistance, and great rewards and benefits. Here is a description of the
first.

YON TAN BZHI DANG LDAN PA'I TSUL KHRIMS DE YANG DAG PAR BLANGS PA DANG BLANGS PA'I RJES SU BSLAB PA LA YON TAN CI YOD CE NA, BDAG LA PHAN PA SOGS SO, , DE LA NYAN THOS LA SOGS PA'I BDAG LA PHAN PA'I BDEN PA SHES PAS NYON MONGS PA DANG SDUG BSNGAL SPANGS PA THOB PA'I PHYIR DU DON DANG BYA BA NYUNG LA RANG ZHI BA DANG DUL BA TZAM SGRUB PA'O,
"What good quality," one may ask, "does morality have when it is taken on in
an excellent way, and when it is followed after one has taken it on?" People
like the listeners are only hoping to achieve a state where they can help
themselves--where they use their knowledge of the truth to rid themselves of
everything related to mental affliction, and every kind of suffering. Towards
this end they limit themselves to a small number of activities, and try to reach
a state where they themselves find some peace, and self-control.

,BYANG SEMS KYI BDAG LA PHAN PA NI SPANGS PA GNYIS DANG YE SHES GNYIS SO, , GZHAN LA PHAN PA NI SEMS BSKYED PA'I DUS NA RIGS YOD MED GNYIS KA LA PHAN PAR ZHUGS PA'O,
Bodhisattvas, on the other hand, undertake to help themselves through gaining
the two kinds of cessation and the two kinds of wisdom. But they also work
to help others; when they reach the wish for enlightenment, they undertake to
be of assistance to both those of a higher kind and those who are not of a
higher kind.

,RIGS MED PA LA PHAN PA 'CHAD PA NA, SKYE BA MANG PO LA PHAN PA NI RE ZHIG NGAN 'GRO LAS SKYOB PA MI DGE BA MA SKYES PA MI SKYED PA DANG SKYES PA SPONG BA'O,
What does it mean to help those who are not of a higher kind? The act of
assisting many beings refers to helping beings to avoid developing non-virtues
that they don't already have, and giving up those which they do; that is, it
refers to protecting them, in the meantime, from the lower realms.

,SKYE BO MANG PO LA BDE BA NI BDE 'GRO LA 'GOD PA DGE BA MA SKYES PA SKYED PA DANG SKYES PA SPEL BA'O,
The act of bringing many beings to happiness refers to helping them develop
those virtues which they don't already have, and increase those which they do;
that is, it refers to leading them, in the meantime, to the higher realms.

The act of feeling compassion for the world refers to biding your time, and
never giving up your hope to help certain beings among the ones who are not
of a higher kind: those who are filled with anger, or who have none of the
necessary virtuous fortune, or who would be a worthy vessel for the Dharma
but have slipped into a wrong way, or who have already passed to the lower
realms. You feel as though they are your guests, and you are waiting to be of
assistance for them.

RIGS YOD PA LA PHAN PA 'CHAD PA NA, LHA DANG MI RNAMS KYI DON NI RIGS YOD PA DAG DGE SBYONG GI TSUL LA 'GOD PA'O,
What does it mean to help those who are of a higher kind? This refers to those
who are of a higher kind in the sense that they are powerful beings of
pleasure, or humans; and you undertake to lead them in the way of the
practice of virtue.

The idea of "assistance" refers to the paths that take you to the way of the
practice of virtue, meaning the paths of accumulation and preparation.
Reaching happiness refers to living in a state of happiness during this life; that
is, enjoying good bodily feelings as you reach a high state of meditational
fluency, and finally undergoing the great pleasure of liberation itself.

,RGYU MTSAN DE DAG GI PHYIR NA DGE BA STE MI SLU BA'O, , 'GREL PA RNAMS NAS RNAM GRANGS GZHAN YANG BSHAD MOD KYI MA BRIS SO,
For all these reasons, morality is "virtue," which refers to the fact that it never
fails. Other equivalent terms for this description are admittedly described in
the various commentaries, but I will not list them all here.

,DPAG TU MED PA NI, BYANG SEMS KYI BSLAB PA'I GZHI DPAG TU MED PA BSDUS PA'O,
"Infinity" refers to the fact that this morality incorporates an infinite number
of points concerning the precepts of the bodhisattva.

,PHAN 'DOGS PA NI, 'JUG PA DANG 'BRAS BU'I DUS NA SEMS CAN LA PHAN BDE'I PHYIR GNAS PA'O,
"Assistance" refers to the fact that one is living to bring help and happiness to
all living beings, both while one is practicing the morality, and once one has
reached the goal of this morality.

,'BRAS BU DANG PHAN YON CHE BA NI, BYANG SEMS KYI SKABS NA RDZOGS PA'I BYANG CHUB 
'BRAS BUR 'DZIN PAS 'BRAS BU CHE BA DANG SANGS RGYAS PA'I SKABS NA GZHAN LA 'BRAS BU SBYIN PAS PHAN YON CHE BA'O,
"Great rewards and benefits" refers to the following. The "great reward" here
is the total enlightenment that is the goal which morality is bringing to you at
the point where you are still a bodhisattva. The "great benefit" is the goal
which morality brings to others, at the point where you are already a Buddha.

These four kinds of greatness, virtue and the rest, do apply to the three
trainings of those of the listener way at the outset. But it is only the morality
of the bodhisattva which has all of them in the following way. At the
beginning, once you have developed the wish for enlightenment, this morality
is virtue from the outset, in being of help to oneself and others, and in being
fully explained. The assistance that the morality gives to all living beings
means that it is virtue during the interim. And it is virtue at the end as well,
since it leads to great rewards and benefits.
D. Divisions of the bodhisattva vows
The following selection is taken from the Highway for Bodhisattvas, ff. 595-6.

'DIR LTUNG BA BSKYED PA'I RTEN CI 'DRA BA ZHIG LA LTUNG BA SDE TSAN DU SKYED PA YIN ZHE NA, RTEN NI THAMS CAD LA YANG SEMS 'KHRUGS PA DANG SDUG BSNGAL GYI TSOR BAS NYEN PA DANG SDOM PA MA MNOS PA LA NI SHIN TU NYES PA MED PAR RIG PAR BYA'O, , ZHES GZHUNG LAS GSUNGS PAS SDOM PA THOB LA MA BTANG BA DANG BSAM PA RNAL DU GNAS PA STE CHOS 
GNYIS DANG LDAN PA ZHIG DGOS SO,
One may ask the following: "What kind of person is it who can commit one of
the downfalls? And what groups of downfalls are there to commit?" The
major texts say the following about the person:
You should understand that there is no wrong at all with anyone whose
mind is disturbed, or who is afflicted by feelings of great pain, or who
has not yet taken the vows.
The point here is that, to commit a downfall, two conditions must apply to
you. First you must be a person who has taken the vows and who has never
lost them. Secondly you must be a person who is in his or her right mind.

,LTUNG BA'I SDE TSAN NAM RIS NI, GNYIS KHO NAR NGES PA STE SDOM PA NYI SHU PA'I 'GREL PA RNYING BA LAS, GANG GI PHYIR BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA'I SDOM PA LA NYES PA'I RIS GNYIS SU ZAD PAR 'BYUNG STE PHAM PA'I GNAS LTA BU'I CHOS SU GTOGS PA DANG NYES BYAS KYI CHOS SU GTOGS PA'O, , DGE SLONG GI SDOM PA LAS NYES PA'I RIS LNGA 'BYUNG BA LTA BU NI MA YIN NO, , ZHES 
DANG ,
As for how many groups of these downfalls there are, we can say that there
are only two, no more and no less. The older commentary to the Twenty Verses
on Vows, for example, states that
The reason is that the vows of the bodhisattva can be included
exhaustively into one or another of two groups of wrong deeds. First
there are those included into the group of bad deeds which are similar
to the major failures of the vows of ordination; and secondly there are
those included into the group of bad deeds which are similar to the
wrong activities which also constitute a category of the vows of
ordination. It is not though the case that, as with the vows of a full
monk, there are five distinct types of wrong deeds.

'GREL PA GSAR MA DANG THUB PA DGONGS RGYAN LAS KYANG LTUNG BA'I LUS SAM SDE GNYIS KHO NAR GSUNGS SHING GZHUNG GI DON YANG DE KHO NA LTAR GNAS PA'I PHYIR RO,
It is moreover the case that the newer commentary, as well as the Jewel of the
True Thought of the Able Ones, specifically state that there are only two
"corpuses," meaning groups, of bodhisattva vows. The principal text concurs
on this point as well.

,DE'I PHYIR BOD KHA CIG DANG NAG PO PA'I DKA' 'GREL LAS BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA'I SDOM PA LA PHAM PA'I GNAS DANG SBOM PO'I LTUNG BA DANG NYES BYAS KYI LTUNG BA RNAMS BSRUNG DGOS PAS ZHES RIS GSUM DU 'CHAD PA MI 'THAD DE, 'THAD NA ZAG PA CHUNG 'BRING GI LTUNG BA RNAMS SBOM POR BYA DGOS NA DE DAG PHAM PA'I GNAS LTA BU'I CHOS DANG NYES BYAS SU GZHUNG 'DIR GSUNGS PA'I PHYIR RO, , DES NA ZAG PA CHUNG 'BRING GI LTUNG BA'I NGO BO NYES BYAS YIN LA RIS SAM SDE TSAN NI PHAM PA'I SDE TSAN YIN TE, DPER NA PHAM PA'I SKABS KYI SBOM PO DANG NYES BYAS RNAMS PHAM PA'I SDE TSAN DU 'JOG PA BZHIN NO,
As such the explanation found in a number of Tibetan commentaries, and in
the Commentary on the Difficult Points by Nakpopa, which describes the groups
of bodhisattva vows as being three, is incorrect. These say that there are three
distinct categories including failures, serious offenses, and wrong deeds. If this
were true though then in cases when you had a lesser or medium instance of
impurity the deed would have to become a serious offense, whereas the
original text here specifically states that such deeds are classified as actions
which are similar to a failure, or as secondary offenses. Therefore the nature
of downfalls involving either lesser or medium instances of impurity is that of
a secondary offense, whereas by category or group they belong to the group
of moral failures. This is similar to the way in which, when we are dealing
with serious offenses and wrong deeds in the part of the monk's vows which
treats the moral failures, we categorize them in the group of the failures.
E. Relationship between the bodhisattva vows and the other two sets of
vows
The following selections are taken from the Highway for Bodhisattvas, ff. 518-519,
533, and 536.

Someone might think the following:
This custom of taking the vows of the bodhisattva and then following
the various precepts is something that applies only to those who have
entered the way of the perfections. It is not something which is
necessary for those who have entered through the gateway of the
teachings of the secret word. Therefore this is not a path for each and
every bodhisattva.

This is an immense misconception, for the following is found in the glorious
Tantra of Sambhuti, and in the Tantra of the Angel of Diamond, and in the Peak of
Diamond:
I will seek to develop the highest state of mind,
The matchless wish to attain enlightenment.
I will keep, and keep firmly, each of the following three:
The training of morality,
The morality of collecting goodness,
And the morality of working for every sentient being.

The point being made here is that, when you take vows of the diamond way,
you must also take the vows of the five Buddha classes, and in conjunction
with these you must agree to develop the wish for enlightenment and then
practice the three different types of morality.

DKYIL 'KOR GYI CHO GA KHUNGS THUB PA DU MAR YANG THUN MONG DANG THUN MONG MA YIN PA'I SDOM PA GNYIS GNYIS 'DZIN DGOS PAR GSUNGS PA'I THUN MONG BA NI BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA'I SDOM PA YIN PA'I PHYIR DANG ,
A great many authoritative texts on the ritual for entering various secret
worlds also state that one must take on two separate sets of vows: the ones
that are shared and the ones that are not. The ones that are shared are none
other than the bodhisattva vows.

Moreover, you do when you commit yourself to the wish for enlightenment
also agree to keep the various precepts of the bodhisattva. And there is no
path in the great way, the way of the perfections, which is anything else than
the training in the three types of morality, in the six perfections.

Moreover, it doesn't matter which of the four different groups of the teachings
of the secret word which you use to enter the secret path: in every case you
will need the path of the wish for enlightenment, and the six perfections. This
path is common then to both the diamond way and the way of the perfections;
it would be totally wrong for anyone following the way of the secret word ever
to disregard it.

When the text of the Bodhisattva Levels is covering the morality of restraint and
says that there are seven different categories of freedom vows, here is what it
means. You should understand this statement as referring both to the actual
seven different categories of these vows, and also to the act of giving up the
natural misdeeds which are common to both these vows and the vows of the
bodhisattva. It does not mean to imply that we are restricted here only to the
seven categories of the freedom vows.

'DI LA SO THAR DANG THUN MONG BA'I RANG BZHIN GYI KHA NA MA THO BA SPONG BA'I SDOM PA'I TSUL KHRIMS NI, BYANG SEMS KYI SDOM PA BZUNG BA DANG MNYAM DU SKYE BAS DE DANG BYANG SEMS KYI SDOM PA LA RTEN DANG BRTEN PA RTZI BA'I DON MED LA, SO THAR RIS BDUN DNGOS LTA BU LA NI SNGAR MA BLANGS KYANG BYANG SEMS KYI SDOM PA SKYE YANG SO THAR GYI RTEN DU RUNG NA SNGON DU KHYIM PA DANG RAB BYUNG GANG RUNG GI SO THAR ZHIG BLANG BAR BYA STE, GZHAN DU NA RGYAL BA'I BSTAN PA'I RIM PA LAS 'DAS PAR 'GYUR BA'I PHYIR TE, DPER NA DGE TSUL MA BLANGS PAR DGE SLONG GI SDOM PA BLANGS NA SKYE MOD KYANG BYAR MI RUNG BA BZHIN NO,
We should clarify this act of giving up the natural misdeeds which are shared
with the vows of freedom. It occurs within you at the same time that you take
on the vows of the bodhisattva. The point here is not so much that these two
should be considered a basis and something resting upon that basis. Rather,
if we are considering the actual seven categories of freedom vows, it is true
that the bodhisattva vows will form within one even if he has never taken
these freedom vows before. Nonetheless, if one is a kind of person who could
properly take on these freedom vows, one should before accepting the
bodhisattva vows take on either one of the sets of freedom vows for layman,
or else those for ordained people. Otherwise you would transgress the proper
order of the teachings of the Victors; it would be like becoming a full monk
without ever having taken on the vows of a novice: although it is quite true
that the vows would form within one, it is not something that would be

Some with no proper basis say the following:
If one is not successful in stopping his or her tendency to think first of
himself or herself, then the vows of the bodhisattva cannot form within
one. In this sense, the vows of freedom are an obstacle to the formation
of the bodhisattva vows.
If one already has the bodhisattva vows and then develops the tendency
to think first of himself or herself, then the vows of the bodhisattva are
damaged. In this sense, the vows of freedom are an obstacle to the
continuation of the bodhisattva vows as well.
This viewpoint is a blunder where the person expressing it has failed to make
a distinction between the freedom vows and the motivation of the lower way.
Although it is the case that one must give up the motivation of the lower way
in order for the vows of the bodhisattva to form within him or her, it is not
true that one must give up the vows of freedom. It is equally true with
someone who possesses the bodhisattva vows that if they develop the
motivation of the lower way they slip away from greater way, but it is not the
case that they lose their freedom vows.

SO THAR NI THEG PA GNYIS KYI THUN MONG BA YIN PA'I PHYIR DANG BSAM PA DE SO THAR GYI GTONG RGYUR MA RIGS PA'I PHYIR DANG SO THAR GYI SDOM LDAN GYIS SDOM PA GONG MA LEN PA NI PHUN SUM TSOGS PA'I RTEN DU 'GYUR BA'I PHYIR RO,
It is moreover the case that the freedom vows are shared by both of the two
ways, and that developing the motivation mentioned could not be something
that makes you lose your freedom vows, and that the very highest and most
excellent form of life is when someone who possesses the vows of freedom
then takes on the higher types of vows.

Therefore the idea that those who are keeping the higher vows must give up
the lower vows is much like a fierce rain of hail, which descends to destroy the
very root of the teachings of the victorious Buddhas, and chops down the rich
crops of all the goodness and happiness that could come to every living
creature. It is the totally blind idea of a person who has absolutely no
understanding of the essential points of the important scriptures of the entire
range of Buddhist schools. As such you must carry this idea far away from
you, and throw it out like rubbish.

The texts describe it extensively, in quotations like the following:
Those who possess an exceptional form of intelligence
Should use their skillful means, in every situation,
To avoid at any cost ever transgressing, even in a dream,
The morality of the monks, and of the bodhisattvas.

We see moreover in many sutras descriptions of those beings who had reached
the level of the Emperor of the World, and who were people living the home
life--great bodhisattvas who had spent many years practicing the activities of
the bodhisattvas. As a result, a great number of them gained a great desire to
leave the home life and take ordination, and this is what they did. Given all
these facts, those who are living the life of the supreme way should in fact
cherish deeply the vows of freedom in general, and especially the vows for
those who have left the home life.

Course VII: The Vows of the Bodhisattva
Reading Three: How the Bodhisattva Vows are Taken
The first selection is from the String of Shining Jewels, by Geshe Tsewang Samdrup
(c. 1835), ff. 16A-16B.

Here first is how those who have not yet been granted the vows of the
bodhisattva may receive them. Begin by prostrating yourself in reverence to
the Buddhas, and to their sons and daughters. Make offerings to them to the
fullest of your ability. Then, for the sake of all living beings, make a fervent
appeal to the one from whom you will take the vows: to your Lama, to one
who is keeping these vows well, and who is a master of the scriptures of the
bodhisattva way, and who has the ability to bring up his student. Take thus
the vows upon yourself.

The following selections are taken from the Highway for Bodhisattvas, ff. 570-5,
582-3, and 588-9.

Master Nagarjuna composed a text for a ceremony to formally raise the wish
for enlightenment within one's mind, but did not compose any separate text
for a ceremony to take on the vows. The following lines though do occur in
his ritual for raising the wish:
Recite the following three times, in order to raise within your own
mind the Wish for Enlightenment:
I swear to gain the ultimate
Wish for Buddhahood,
And take all living kind in my care;
I swear I will sweetly do
All those highest deeds
That Bodhisattvas do.
For the sake of all, let me be the Buddha.

In the commentary to the Light on the Path as well it states that the ceremonies
composed by Lord Atisha for raising the wish for enlightenment within oneself
and for taking on the vows represent the system followed by Masters
Nagarjuna, Asanga, and Shantideva. So despite the fact that there are a few
minor differences in the wording of the ceremonies composed by Arya
Nagarjuna and Arya Asanga, there is no difference at all in their actual
meaning.

Master Jetari describes a two-step process of committing oneself (1) to the wish
in the form of a prayer and to the wish in the form of action; and then (2)
taking the vows. The glorious Dipamkara [Atisha] as well delineates separate
ceremonies for both raising the wish for enlightenment within one's mind and
then taking on the vows. The commentary to the Compendium of the Sutras, and
the commentary to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life by Master Nakpopa too, make
separate presentations for ceremonies in which one commits to the wish as a
prayer and the wish in action.

It does not seem in my opinion correct to establish separate ceremonies for
committing to the wish in action and then taking the vows. It is the case
though that, when you go through a ceremony for committing to the wish in
the form of a prayer first, you make this prayer even more firm in your mind.
Then if later you perform the ceremony for taking the vows, the vows
themselves are much more firm as well. This is an excellent method which has
been followed by the spiritual guides of our tradition in the past.

,DKYUS KYI DON LA GNYIS, BLA MA YOD PA'I CHO GA DANG , BLA MA MED PA'I CHO GA'O, , DANG PO LA GSUM, SBYOR BA DANG , DNGOS GZHI DANG , MJUG GI CHO GA'O,
The continuation of our explanation has two parts: a description of the
ceremony for taking the vows with a Lama, and description of the ceremony

for taking the vows without a Lama. There are three sections to the first point
as well: the preparation, the main stage, and then the conclusion.

,DANG PO LA LNGA, GSOL BA GDAB PA, TSOGS SGRUB PA, SDOM PA MYUR DU BSKUL BA, SPRO BA BSKYED PA, BAR CHAD DRI BA'O,
The preparation itself has five different steps: the request, the assemblage, the
exhortation to hurry, the feeling of joy, and the questions concerning obstacles.
 , GSOL BA GDAB PA LA GNYIS, GANG ZAG GI KHYAD PAR DANG , CHO GA'I KHYAD PAR RO, , GANG ZAG GI KHYAD PAR LA GNYIS LAS, RTEN GYI KHYAD PAR NI,
There are two points concerning the request: details of the persons, and details
of the ceremony. The details of the persons are two, the first being details of
the kind of person.

"What kind of person," you may ask, "must you be to take the vows?" The
bodhisattva can be either a layperson or someone who is ordained. They must
feel a wish from the bottom of their hearts to practice the training for
bodhisattvas that we have described above; that is, the three kinds of morality.
They must also have raised up in their hearts the prayer of the wish for
enlightenment--they must have made the prayer to achieve total Buddhahood
in the proper way, following the instructions.

,SDOM PA BZUNG BA TZAM BYED KYI BYANG SEMS KYI BSLAB PA LA SLOB 'DOD MED PA DANG SMON SEMS MA BSKYED PA LA NI SDOM PA SBYIN PAR MI BYA'O,
One should not grant the vows to someone who is only taking the vows, but
who has no interest in practicing the training for bodhisattvas; neither should
one give these vows to someone who has not yet felt the wish in the form of
a prayer in their hearts.

,DE LTAR SDOM PA YANG DAG PAR BLANG BAR 'DOD PA'I BYANG SEMS LA BRTAN PAR BYA BA'I PHYIR SDOM PA STER BA'I SNGA ROL NAS BYANG SEMS KYI SDE SNOD KYI MA MO BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA'I SA 'DI LAS BYANG SEMS KYI BSLAB PA'I GZHI DANG NYES PA'I GNAS GANG DAG BSTAN PA DE DAG BSGRAG PAR BYA STE,
If there is a person who does have the right intention to take the vows, there
is something you should do then first before you grant them, for it will make
their vows more firm. This is to inform the candidate thoroughly of the
various points in which a bodhisattva must train himself or herself, and of the
various mistakes they must avoid, as described in the great mother work
within the body of bodhisattva literature: this very Bodhisattva Levels.

The reason for explaining all this to the candidate is so that he or she can look
into his or her own heart and see whether or not they will be able to keep the
vows; it is so they can analyze the situation intelligently, and then take the
vows, and do so with joy. The point is not to somehow force the person into
accepting the vows against their will. It is important as well that the person
not see themselves as trying to keep up with what others are doing and take
the vows for this reason. Understand that if you give the vows thus properly,
and with the proper ritual, they will be strong; be certain to do everything with
your eyes open.

In this sense the bodhisattva vows are unlike the freedom vows; before you
take them, you must go for teachings on them and understand them
thoroughly. With this your intentions to keep the vows carefully will be
strengthened, and then you are ready to take them. It is said that if you do
have these intentions the vows will form within you as you take them, and
that they will not form if you do not.

Here secondly are the details of the person from who you receive the vows.
"And what kind of person is it," you may ask, "from whom we must take the
bodhisattva vows?" The person should be one who has made the bodhisattva
prayer; that is, who has raised within himself the wish in the form of a prayer.
He or she must also be someone who is "acting consistently," which means that
they are keeping the vows of the bodhisattva well. They should be a master
of the teachings of the greater way, and should be able to memorize the words
of the ceremony and communicate them clearly in speech to the person taking
the vows, and so on. Finally they must be able to hear and comprehend the
responses of the candidate.

"What kind of person," one may continue, "should we not take our bodhisattva
vows from?" Bodhisattvas should not accept the bodhisattva vows from just
any bodhisattva that there is, even if they seem very learned; rather they
should avoid those whose intentions or practice have degenerated. The
person's intentions have degenerated if they have lost their faith, which means
on a gross level that they no longer wish to keep the vows, and on a medium
level that they no longer practice them, and on a more subtle level that they
are no longer "thinking," which means making good efforts in their vows. The
practice has degenerated when the person's attempts to follow the six
perfections have failed.

To put briefly, you should first sweep and clean the area well, and then
decorate it. Then you should set out many holy images, with an image of the
Teacher at their head. Try first then to feel an intense emotion of faith, which
you can bring on by imagining that you can actually see the victorious
Buddhas and their sons and daughters, come before you from every corner of
the universe, and then concentrating upon their fine spiritual qualities.

With this feeling in mind, focus upon your Lama, seated upon a lion throne,
and think of him or her as they are described in the ritual--as actually being
the Buddha himself. Set forth excellent, lovely and plentiful offerings: flowers,
and scents, and incense, lamps and all the rest. Make prostrations and then

recite verses of praise, followed by a mandala and offerings presented
individually to each of the three Jewels, and to your Lama. The Lama should
instruct the student well in the proper procedures, and show them how to
carry out this ritual.

In every time, in every corner of the universe.
This code is a mine of gold, every merit lies in it;
With the highest of intentions, take it on yourself
From a Lama keeping all these vows very well himself,
One who is a master of them, one with ability.
At that time, because of all the virtue that there is,
The Buddhas of the victory, along with their sons and daughters
Look on you forever, from the virtue of their hearts,
As if you were their daughter, as if you were their son.

The first two lines here represent the entire process of the preparation stage of
the ritual for taking the bodhisattva vows. The next six lines describe what
you should take, and the motivation for doing so, and then the person from
whom you should take these vows. The final four lines show how you uplift
the candidate by speaking of the great benefits of the vows, which is meant to
represent the concluding stage of the ceremony.

Reading Four: The Root Vows, Part One
The following selection is taken from the String of Shining Jewels, by Geshe Tsewang
Samdrup (c. 1835).

Next we describe ways for those who have received the bodhisattva vows to
keep them, and prevent their decline. You must first submit yourself, in the
proper way, to a holy spiritual guide, one who is learned in the scriptures of
the bodhisattva way, and in the commentaries which explain the true intent of
these scriptures. Then you must educate yourself in all the various bodhisattva
precepts. You should especially learn the eighteen root downfalls, the forty-six
secondary offenses, and so on.

`, DANG PO RTZA LTUNG BCO BRGYAD NI,
The eighteen root downfalls
We begin then with the eighteen root downfalls:

RNYED PA DANG BKUR STI LA CHAGS NAS RANG LA BSTOD CING , GZHAN YON TAN CAN LA SMAD NA BDAG BSTOD GZHAN SMOD KYI RTZA LTUNG ,
(1) The root downfall of praising yourself, and criticizing others.
You commit this when, out of attachment to gain or honor, you praise yourself,
and criticize others who in actuality possess good qualities. This can be
divided into two separate root downfalls, those of praising oneself and of
criticizing others.

(2) The root downfall of failing to give Dharma or material assistance
You commit this in a situation where you should be giving the Dharma that
you know, or the material things that you own, to those who are suffering, to
those who have no protector. Instead though you fail to give them these
things, due to feelings of possessiveness. This can be divided into the two root
downfalls of failing to give the Dharma and of failing to give material
assistance.

(3) The root downfall of failing to accept someone's apology, and striking another
You commit this when someone comes to you in the appropriate manner and
explains themselves in some way, such as asking your forgiveness or the like.
Instead though you remain angry and commit various kinds of harm towards

them physically or verbally. This can be divided into the two root downfalls
of striking another and of not accepting a person's explanation of themselves.

(4) The root downfall of giving up the greater way, and teaching false dharma
You commit this when you give up the scriptures of the bodhisattva way,
saying: "These were not spoken by the Buddha." Then you take pleasure in
some false dharma yourself, and teach it to others as well. This can be divided
into the two root downfalls of giving up the greater way and of teaching false
dharma.

(5) The root downfall of stealing what belongs to the Jewels
You commit this in the following way. There is some material wealth or object
which has been dedicated to the Three Jewels. Although you have no right to
do so, you intentionally take the thing for yourself. You do so either by
yourself or by having someone else do it for you, and by any of the various
ways: thieving in stealth, robbing by force, or taking away through some clever
means. The downfall is complete when you obtain the thing. This can be
divided into three different root downfalls, one each for stealing what belongs
to each one of the three different Jewels.

THEG PA GSUM GYI SDE SNOD GSUM SPANGS PA'I RTZA LTUNG GSUM,
(6) The root downfall of giving up the highest Dharma
You commit this when you discount the scriptural collections of the three
ways, which present each and every aspect of the path, by saying "This is not
the word of the Buddha." This can be divided into three different root
downfalls, one each for giving up the respective scriptural collections of each
of the three ways.

(7) The root downfall of taking away the golden robes, and the rest, and removing
someone from the status of an ordained person
You commit this when you take an ordained person, whether they be one who
is maintaining their morality or not, and take away their golden robes, or beat
them, or incarcerate them; or else remove them from the status of being
ordained. This can be divided into the two root downfalls of taking away a
person's golden robes or the rest, and of removing a person from the status of
an ordained person.

You commit this when you commit any one or combination of the following:
killing your father, killing your mother, killing an enemy destroyer, creating
a schism in the Sangha, or drawing blood from One Thus Gone with evil
intent. This can be divided into five separate root downfalls, corresponding
to each of the five immediate misdeeds.

You commit this when you hold to ideas such as "There is no relation between
the deeds we commit and the consequences we experience," or "There are no
past or future lives," or anything of the like.

(10) The root downfall of destroying towns and such
You commit this when destroy towns, or cities, or whole areas, or entire
countries. This can be divided into the four different root downfalls of
destroying towns, and then each of the rest.

(11) The root downfall of teaching emptiness to a person who is not yet mentally
prepared
You commit this with a person who has not yet reached a level where he or
she can absorb the teachings on emptiness, and yet who has been able to
develop the wish to achieve total enlightenment. The downfall is completed
when, as a result of your teaching them emptiness, they become frightened--in
such a way that they turn back from their wish to achieve full enlightenment,
and develop instead a wish to achieve the goals of the lower way.

(12) The root downfall of causing a person to turn back from total enlightenment
Committing this begins when you say the following to a person who has
already developed the wish to achieve total enlightenment:
You will never be able to carry out the six perfections, and
actually reach Buddhahood. If you strive instead for the goals of
the listeners and self-made Buddhas, then you will manage to
liberate yourself from the circle of suffering life."
When because of your talking this way the person turns back from his or her
wish to achieve full enlightenment, the downfall is complete.

(13) The root downfall of causing a person to give up the morality of freedom
You commit this with a person who is keeping properly the morality of
individual freedom. You say to him or her, "What's the use of keeping the
morality of freedom pure? You should rather develop the wish to achieve full
enlightenment--you should come over to the greater way." And then you say,
"If you do so, you'll be able to stop each and every bad deed committed
through any of the three doors of expression."
When because of your talking this way the person turns away from the
morality of individual freedom, the root downfall is completed.

(14) The root downfall of holding that a person cannot eliminate desire and the rest
by following the way of the learner
You commit this when you hold that the realizations of listeners and self-made
Buddhas could never liberate a person from the circle of suffering life: you
discount the lesser way, saying "Regardless of how much a person might train
himself in the ways of the listeners and the self-made Buddhas, he could never
thereby eliminate the mental afflictions in their entirety."

The root downfall of criticizing someone else due to one's desire for the adulation of
others
With this root downfall you are reciting teachings of the greater way, or
reading them, presenting them to others, or anything of the like, all out of an
attachment to material gain or the respect of others. At the same time though
you claim, "I am a practitioner of the greater way who has no concern for
material gain, the respect of others, or any such thing. That other person
though is not this way at all." The downfall is complete when you have
expressed the praise on one hand, and the criticism on the other.
It is stated that, since this root downfall is subsumed by the first
downfall--that of praising oneself and criticizing others--it should not be
counted as a separate downfall.

(15) The root downfall of professing the complete opposite
You commit this as follows. In actuality, you have yet to perceive emptiness
directly. Nonetheless you teach the subject of emptiness to others and say,
"Meditate as I have taught you, and you will come to see emptiness; then you'll
be just like me." The downfall is completed as soon as the other person grasps
the meaning of your words.

(16) The root downfall of accepting what belongs to the Jewels when someone presents
it to you
Suppose a king and his minister or any such official is exacting some
punishment, and has taken an object that belongs to the Jewels, or to the
Sangha, or to an individual monk. And suppose that they offer it to you. You
commit this downfall when you accept the thing, and come into possession of
it.

(17) The root downfall of rejecting the practice of quietude, and giving the possessions
of meditators to those whose practice is recitation
You commit this as follows. Out of feelings of dislike for them, you take away
the possessions of meditators who are average people engaged in balanced
meditation on quietude. Then you give these possessions to persons whose
practice is recitation.

BYANG CHUB KYI SEMS GTONG NA, BYANG CHUB SEMS 'DOR GYI RTZA LTUNG 1A8,

You commit this if you ever give up the wish for enlightenment.

Course VII: The Vows of the Bodhisattva
Reading Six: The Four Chains, Restoring the Vows, and How the
Vows are Lost
The following reading is taken from the String of Shining Jewels, by Geshe Tsewang
Samdrup (early 19th Century), a tutor of His Holiness the Tenth Dalai Lama.

RTZA LTUNG 'DI DANG , RTZA LTUNG DGU PA LOG PA LTA BA 'DZIN PA'I RTZA LTUNG GNYIS SKYE BA LA KUN DKRIS TSANG MI DGOS SHING ,
In the case of two of the root downfalls--that is, with this last one and also
with the ninth, where you hold to wrong views--it is not necessary for all four
of the "binding" mental afflictions to be present in order for a root downfall to
occur.

With the other sixteen root downfalls though there must be what we call a
"major" instance of the binding mental afflictions. For an instance of the
binding mental afflictions to be "major," all four must be present. These four
binding mental afflictions are as follows:
(1) A desire to commit still more of the particular wrong deed;
(2) A lack of any shame or consideration;
(3) A sense of enjoyment, and satisfaction; as well as
(4) Failing to consider one's deed as something wrong.

If one possesses the fourth mental affliction, and on top of it the first three as
well, then this is a "major" instance of the binding mental afflictions. There are
other cases where one possesses the fourth affliction and in addition to it only
two of the first three, or else only one of these three, or perhaps no more than
the fourth on its own. All these cases are said to represent a "medium"
impurity. The first three are said to be a "lesser" impurity.

A person can be engaged in a basic form of one of the sixteen root downfalls
and yet, should the requirement of a "major" instance of the binding mental
afflictions not be filled, he or she is only committing a kind of downfall
subsumed by a lesser or medium level of impurity. Such a person then would
only be performing a secondary offense categorized in the collection of root
downfalls.

KUN DKRIS CHEN PO TSANG BA'I RTZA LTUNG NGAM, SMON SEMS GTONG BA, LOG LTA BYUNG BA LTA BU LA SDOM PA SLAR BSLANG DGOS SHING ,
This brings us to the third part in our presentation on the vows of the
bodhisattva, which concerns how to restore them, should they happen to
decline. Any time you commit one of the root downfalls and a "major"
instance of the binding mental afflictions has occurred, or else when something
happens like giving up the prayer for the wish for enlightenment or
developing wrong views, you must take the vows over again.

Whenever you commit offenses that involve a medium level of impurity, you
should confess them before a group of three or more persons. Whenever you
commit offenses involving a lesser level of impurity, or else any of the forty-six
secondary offenses or anything of the like, then you should confess them
before a single person.

Any time you commit any other offenses, the best thing you can do is to
confess it before a single person, and so on. If you can't do that, then you
should confess before an altar with representations of the body, speech, and
mind of the Buddha, with a strong feeling that you are performing your
confession in the presence of the victorious Buddhas, along with their
bodhisattva sons and daughters.

SKYABS 'GRO SEMS BSKYED, LTUNG BSHAGS, SPYI BSHAGS, RDOR SEMS BSGOMS BZLAS SOGS KYI SGO NAS BSHAGS PAR YANG BYA'O, ,
You should also confess and purify yourself through the practices of going for
refuge and praying to develop the wish for enlightenment, performing a
confession of downfalls, a general confession, meditation and recitation on the
practice of the Warrior of Diamond, and so on.

BSHAGS PA SNGA PHYI 'DI RNAMS KYI TSE GNYEN PO STOBS BZHI TSANG BA'I SGO NAS BSHAGS DGOS SHING   ,
Whenever you perform any of the confessions mentioned throughout here you
must do so with all four of the antidote forces complete. . .

************
The following selections are taken from the Highway for Bodhisattvas, by Je
Tsongkapa (1357-1419), ff. 627, 638-641, 645, and 647-8.

MDOR NA PHAM PA GCIG BYUNG NA YANG TSE DE LA SA DANG PO THOB PA MI SRID CING DE DANG NYE BA'I RGYU TSOGS RGYA CHEN PO SNGAR YOD 'PHEL BA DANG SNGAR MED SKYED PA'I SKAL BA MED NA PHAM PA YANG DANG YANG DU BYUNG NA LTA CI SMOS,
We may summarize these points as follows. If a person commits even one of
the "defeats" [root downfalls], it is impossible for him or her to attain the first
bodhisattva level within the same life. One also loses the spiritual fortune to
see the close cause of this attainment, the great collection of virtue necessary
to reach the first bodhisattva level, increase in its power (for whatever amount
one has already collected) or occur in the first place (for whatever amount one
has yet to collect). I need not mention then what happens when you commit
these defeats over and over again.

DE'I PHYIR PHAM PA BYUNG YANG BYANG SEMS KYI SDOM PA BLANG DU YOD PAS SNYAM DU MI BSAM PAR RTZA LTUNG GIS GTAN MA GOS PA LA SROG BSDOS BYA'O,
Therefore you must never think to yourself: "Well, even if I did commit one of
the defeats, it doesn't matter, I could take my bodhisattva vows over again."
Rather you must, at the cost of your very life, avoid ever being defiled by a
root downfall of the vows.

Again we can summarize as follows. Suppose you commit a root downfall,
but from the point just after you do so, and on, you do not lose your wish for
enlightenment in the form of a prayer. The power of this kind of wish then
prevents the fact that you have committed a root downfall from acting as a
block that would stop the vows from ever growing again in you. If you lack

this kind of wish though there would be nothing to block the power of the root
downfall, and this would make your vows something that you could not
restore. This is the point of the quotation.

One may ask the following question:
You've said that, for a major instance of the "chains" to occur, the
following case must hold. As for the aspect where something is
missing, there must then be a failure for the emotions of shame
and consideration to occur, and one must not consider his or her
actions something wrong. As for the aspect where something is
present, there must a desire to repeat the action in the future, and
also pleasure and gladness with what one has done. Both of
these aspects must be complete. From what point up to what
point must the two lacks of something be, and from what point
up to what point must the two occurrences of something be?

As for the two lacks of something, they must be continual from the point
where one intends to do the action on through to the end of the actual
commission of the deed. If though during this interval one feels any sense of
shame or consideration, or else during this same interval considers his act to
be wrong, then the necessary components of a major instance of the "chains"
are not complete.

The case is similar for the two thoughts that must be present. They must occur
during the same interval, and on from the completion of the commission of the
deed on, in such a way that they are not stopped. It would be too much to say
though that they had to occur in one's mind in an unbroken stream throughout
this whole period.

Now generally speaking, the freedom vows can be had by persons of both the
greater way and the lesser one, and so we can say that there are both greater-
way and lesser-way vows of freedom. The disciples for whom these rules
were primarily instituted though are persons of the lesser way. Whether or not
those of the lesser way actually manage to attain the level of an enemy
destroyer in this life, they must still don the armor of the great intention, in
order to eliminate the impurities during their life; they must put forth a mighty
effort to eliminate their mental afflictions, with the same effort they would
apply in trying to extinguish the flames if their hair or clothes were to catch on
fire.

PAS SDOM PA BLANGS PA'I DGOS PA'I GTZO BO GTAN LDOG LA,
And so when they take their vows they are doing so in order to eliminate all
the impurities. If they were to commit one of the defeats, and if they
concealed the fact, then this would prevent them from ever attaining the
elimination of all their impurities in this life. The main purpose of their taking
their vows then would be totally lost.

It is not the case though that the main purpose for a bodhisattva to take his or
her bodhisattva vows is lost even should he or she commit a root downfall of
these vows. This then is the real reason why one of these two types of vows
can be restored, and the other not. . .

Concerning this point, suppose someone gives back his or her bodhisattva
vows. He or she has first agreed to accomplish the help and happiness of an
infinite number of living beings, and then stopped keeping their vows
altogether. As a result they will fall to the lower births, and then be forced to
wander there for a very long time; for if one must pass to the lower realms for
destroying the happiness of even a single living creature, what need is there
to mention what happens when you destroy the happiness of a limitless
number of beings? For this and many other reasons is the point above proven.

The above reasons all relate to a case where one gives up the wish for
enlightenment in the form of a prayer; and even if one were not to give it up,
yet still gave up the great pledge of taking on oneself the deeds of a
bodhisattva, it would be nearly the same thing. Therefore it is totally wrong
to give back one's vows. Thus too one should consider everything very
carefully before one even takes on the vows, for it is very grave if one goes
wrong.

The forty-six secondary offenses
Here next we will explain the forty-six different secondary offenses against the
vows of a bodhisattva.
(1) The secondary offense of failing to make offering to the Jewels through the three
doors of expression
You commit this when a single period of 24 hours passes, and you have not
yet made offering to any one or combination of the Three Jewels by means of
the three doors of expression; that is, through bowing down with your body,
and praising with your words, and admiring with your thoughts.

You commit this when you fail to try to stop a thought that comes up in
yourself such as an inordinate desire for an object, or not being satisfied with
what you have, an attachment to having others pay you honor, or anything of
the like.

(3) The secondary offense of failing to pay respect to one's elders
You commit this with a person who is your elder in the sense of having taken
the precepts of the bodhisattva before you, and who has good qualities, and
is worthy of your honor. The offense is done when you fail to pay them
respect by honoring them in some way, or the like.

(5) The secondary offense of failing to accept an invitation
You commit this when someone invites you to partake of a meal, accept some
article of clothing, or anything of the like, but out of pride, or a wish to hurt
them, anger, or laziness, you refuse to come.

laziness, you refuse to accept gold or silver or any other kind of material
wealth that a sponsor has tried to offer to you.

or laziness--you fail to give the Dharma to those who wish it.

(8) The secondary offense of rejecting persons with sullied morality
Suppose you encounter persons with sullied morality: those who have
committed one of the immediate misdeeds, or one of the root downfalls. You
commit this offense when, because of what they have done, and with feelings
of wanting to hurt them, or out of anger or laziness, you reject and ignore
them completely.

(9) The secondary offense of failing to follow the rules, which leads other persons to
develop faith
You commit this when you fail to follow the rules of the teachings on

the listeners, for this is something that protects the minds of others.

(10) The secondary offense of performing deeds which are only of lesser benefit for all
living beings
A bodhisattva need not necessarily observe certain kinds of proscribed morality
from the teachings on discipline in the same way that a person of the listener
tradition would. An example would be the downfalls which are exclusively
proscribed, such as the one in the "abandonment" group, where a monk has
kept cloth for over ten days. If it is not incumbent on you to do so and yet
still you observe this vow in exactly the same way that someone of the listener
tradition would, then you have committed this offense.

(11) The secondary offense of failing to break a rule out of compassion
There are certain extraordinary situations where specific misdeeds--the seven
of taking life and the rest--are allowed for a person who possesses the wish
for enlightenment, and who is practicing the precepts of the bodhisattva in the
proper way. If you are this kind of person and it would be of extraordinary
benefit to others if you did commit such a deed, then you have committed this
offense when you fail to do so.

(12) The secondary offense of taking up wrong livelihood
You commit this when you take up any one or combination of the five kinds
of wrong livelihood, and fail to take some corrective measure. These five are
trying to obtain things through pretending, flattering, hinting, forcing, or
baiting.

with fun and games or chattering on in a silly way. You also do so if you try
to get others to act wild and so on.

(14) The secondary offense of thinking that you only have to travel through the circle
of suffering life
You commit this when you think to yourself, and also say to others, the
following: "Bodhisattvas don't like to reach nirvana; in fact, they work for the
opposite. They have no fear of the mental afflictions, and they do not try to
keep their minds totally away from these thoughts. They only want to achieve
Buddhahood, and they wander around in the circle of suffering life for three
'countless' eons."

Suppose you have said or done something that has led to some vile rumors or
slanderous talk which might cause people to doubt the veracity or purity of
what you say. You commit this offense when you fail to take steps to clarify
the situation and stop the rumors.

negative way
Suppose another person is committing bad deeds in their actions or speech,
and you realize that if you took some very forceful action towards them you
would be able to set them straight. You commit this offense when, for no
more reason than to have them maintain their good opinion of you, you fail
then to take this step.

Suppose you have done something wrong towards another person, or even

out of a desire to hurt them, or pride, or laziness, you fail to explain yourself
to them in an appropriate manner.

Suppose another person has done something wrong to you, and they come to
you in an appropriate way to explain themselves. If out of a desire to hurt
them, or thoughts of malice, or simply because you don't feel like it you refuse
to accept this apology, then you have committed the offense.

This offense refers first of all to the entire day, and to the first and final periods
of the night: all but the middle part. Suppose that during this time you quite
willingly give yourself up to the pleasant feeling of sleep; or to the pleasure of
laying down, staying in bed, or anything of the like. And you do so because
of sloth, out of laziness. When you act this way and fail to dispel these
tendencies, then you've committed the offense.

You commit this offense when, despite the fact that you want to learn how to
put your mind into balanced meditation, you fail to go to a person who could
impart to you the necessary instructions for developing concentration, and you
do so out of a desire to hurt someone, or laziness.

meditation: the pair of restless desire and missing something or someone;
feelings of malice about someone; the pair of drowsiness and mental dullness;
attraction to the objects of the senses; and unresolved doubts. You commit this

so on. This is not however necessary for bodhisattvas."

harmful);

5) Someone who is trying to protect their belongings;
6) Someone who is trying to fix a split between people;
7) Someone who is planning a virtuous event of some kind;

seven problems: they are blind, deaf, handicapped, weary from travelling,
tormented by any of the five mental obstacles, haunted by thoughts such as
malice towards someone, or suffering from defeat at the hands of someone
else. You commit this offense if, out of anger or laziness, you fail to make
some attempt to remove the suffering they are undergoing due to the problem
they have.

someone or such when needed
Suppose you do possess various magical powers, and a situation has arisen
where it would be the right time to use them to frighten a person, or inspire
them, or prevent someone without vows from trying to make use of offerings
that have been made [to the Sangha] in true faith, or anything of the like. If
in such a case you fail to use your powers to frighten the person, or inspire
them, or to prevent someone without vows from trying to make use of
offerings that have been made in true faith, or anything of the like, then you
commit this offense.

Secondary offenses against the precepts of the prayer for the wish for enlightenment

Here we will list additional offenses, which are committed against the precepts
of the prayer for the wish for enlightenment. One would be failing to support
those whom it would be proper to support, either with Dharma or with
material things. Another would be failing to let go of your anger about
something someone else had done to hurt you, or else discriminating between
people, in the sense of liking some and disliking others.

There is also failing to take yourself to a holy lama, and giving up the practices
of learning and contemplation upon what you have learned. Another is failing
to have helping others in mind as you partake of food or clothing or any other
thing you make use of. A final example would be to engage in any virtuous
activity without having in mind the wish to reach enlightenment for the sake
of all living beings. All these are spoken to be secondary offenses against the
prayer.
The four black deeds, and the four white deeds

`SKYE BA GZHAN DU YANG BYANG CHUB KYI SEMS DANG MI 'BRAL BA'I RGYU, NAG CHOS BZHI SPONG ZHING , DKAR CHOS BZHI BLANG BAR BYA DGOS PAS DE'I TSUL NI,
There are certain causes that will, further, prevent you from losing the wish for
enlightenment in your other lives. For these you will have to give up the four
black deeds, and then take up the four white deeds. Here is how to do so.

The first black deed is to intentionally deceive your Lama, or those to whom
we make offerings, or any such person, by lying to them. The antidote for
doing this is the first of the white deeds, which is never intentionally speaking
a lie, even if only in jest, to any single living being there is.

The second black deed is to cause another person to regret some virtuous thing
they have done. The antidote for doing this is the fourth white deed, which
is to bring a person that you are cultivating to strive for total enlightenment,

The third black deed is to say something unpleasant to a bodhisattva out of
anger. The antidote for doing this is the third white deed, which is to try to
conceive of every sentient being as the Teacher himself, and to see all beings
and things as totally pure.

The fourth black deed is to act in a devious way with any living being, without
any sense of personal responsibility for their enlightenment. The antidote for
doing this is the second white deed, where you maintain an attitude of total
honesty towards every living being, free of any kind of deception.

The following selections are taken from pp. 697-722 of the Highway for
Bodhisattvas, written by Tsongkapa the Great (1357-1419).

Here secondly are instructions for protecting your mind from these offenses.
Let us first say a word about all the details we have given thus far about the
rules that bodhisattvas must follow. There is not one of them which is not
taken directly from the sutras themselves; everything from the explanation of
the three types of morality on up can be found scattered throughout a variety
of sources spoken by the Teacher in the collection of sutras. These scattered
references were then explicated, in their entirety, by the realized being Asanga,
as he brought them into a single work, and a single lineage, here in the great
grandfather of all the books in the scriptural collection for bodhisattvas.

Since this code of life is such, since it is anything but something that someone
just made up, bodhisattvas should develop a sense of respect for it, and follow
its rules. This respect should lead them on to three excellent intentions, which
bring them to take the vows from another person, and then develop--from the
very depths of their hearts--a regard for the code that treats it as the highest
of all objects. Finally then they must keep to the code, never violating the
rules they have been given.

,BSAM PA GSUM NI, DE DAG LA SLOB PAR 'DOD PA'I BSAM PA RNAM PAR DAG PA DANG BYANG CHUB 'DOD PA'I BSAM PA DANG SEMS CAN GYI DON BYA BA'I BSAM PA'O,
The three excellent intentions are as follows:
--the pure intention where you wish to follow the rules;
--the intention where you wish to reach enlightenment; and
--the intention of working for the benefit of every living being.

Here thirdly is the method by which the vows can be restored, should one
break them. We should of course make every effort to keep our vows from
ever being sullied. We may though come to commit an offense through one
of the four causes of a downfall: through not knowing the vows, or through
carelessness, or an attack of bad thoughts, or else through a lack of respect for
the vows. Even should an offense thus occur, we can fix our vows by
restoring them in the proper way.

,PHAM PA LAS GZHAN PA'I BYANG SEMS KYI BSLAB PA LAS 'GAL BA'I NYES PA THAMS CAD NI NYES BYAS SU 'DUS KYI SO THAR LTAR NYES PA'I RIS MANG PO MED DO,
All offenses against the code of the bodhisattvas which are not in the category
of "major defeats" belong to the group known as "secondary offenses." It is not
though the case that, as with the vows of freedom, there are many different
categories of offenses.

,DE DAG BYUNG NA NYAN THOS KYI THEG PA PA'AM THEG PA CHEN PO PA GANG RUNG BSHAGS PA'I NGAG GI RIG BYED KYI TSIG DON KHONG DU CHUD CING 'DZIN NUS PA LA BSHAGS PAR BYA'O,
If one should commit one of these offenses, then he or she should make a
confession to a person who can belong either to the way of the listeners or to
the greater way, but who should be able to grasp and comprehend the
meaning of the words you are using to communicate your confession.

If the person to whom you are making the confession is someone with freedom
vows but without the bodhisattva vows, then they must be either a full monk
or a full nun, since it is improper for a novice monk or the like even to be the
person to whom you confess a downfall of the freedom vows. Furthermore,
I believe that, if the person making the confession were ordained, it would be
improper for him or her to do so to a layman, if there were available another
ordained person to whom they could confess.

,GAL TE KUN DKRIS CHEN POS PHAM PA'I GNAS LTA BU'I CHOS BYUNG NA DES SDOM PA BTANG BA LAN GNYIS SU SLAR YANG NOD PAR BYA BAR GZHUNG 'DIR GSUNGS SO,
The present text states that, should a person commit one of the actions that
resemble the major defeats of a monk or nun, and should it further be a
"major" instance of the mental afflictions called "chains," then the vows are lost,
and must be taken again, for a second time.

Some people have said that secondary offenses committed in an afflicted state
of mind must be confessed before someone, should a person be available; but
that those committed in a state of mind which is not afflicted may be purified
simply in the mind, through the intention of restraining oneself in the future,
even though there is available a person to whom you could confess. This
practice though is incorrect, for it is stated in the Levels of the Bodhisattva that
there is no difference between the two cases.

,DES NA ZAG PA CHUNG 'BRING DANG NYES BYAS ZHE LNGA NI YUL YOD NA BSDAMS PA TZAM GYIS MI 'DAG PAS GZHUNG NAS GSUNGS PA BZHIN BYA'O,
Therefore, in a lesser or medium instance of impurity, and with any of the 45
secondary offenses, one cannot be purified simply with the intention of
restraining oneself, should there be available a person to whom you can
confess. As such, one should follow the course of action described in the text.

With all the other offenses, it is very desirable if you can confess them before
someone, since this will make it easy for you to feel the emotion of shame and
embarrassment. If though this is not possible, you should bring to mind all the
Buddhas, along with their sons and daughters, and make your confession to
them. This is in keeping with the Chapter on Morality, which states:

You must admit completely your mistakes, and view them as
something wrong; with this knowledge, and this realization of
how wrong they are, you must give these actions up. These
mistakes too you must confess, as offenses, before the Buddhas
and the bodhisattvas, and before those with whom you share the
Dharma.

LNGA PA LTUNG BA CHE CHUNG GI DBYE BA NI   BYED PA LAS NI MI SHES PA DANG BAG MED KYIS BYAS PA CHUNG NGU NYON MONGS MANG BAS BYAS PA 'BRING MA GUS PAS BYAS PA CHEN PO'O,
The fifth part of our discussion concerns the division of the downfalls into
those which are more serious, and those which are less. As for the instigation,
those downfalls committed through ignorance of the vows or through
carelessness are the least serious. Those committed through an attack of
mental afflictions are moderately serious. And those committed through a lack
of respect for the vows are the most serious of all.

,BSAM PA LAS NI, DUG GSUM CHUNG 'BRING CHE GSUM GYIS BYAS PA RNAMS CHUNG 'BRING CHEN PO'O,
As for a person's state of mind, those downfalls committed through the three
mental poisons [of liking, disliking, or ignorance] in either lesser, medium, or
greater strength are--respectively--serious to a lesser, or medium, or greater
degree.

As for the object of the deed, there can also be cases where the downfall is
serious to a lesser, or medium, or greater degree even if it is committed in the
same state of mind towards different objects which share a common quality.

Suppose for example that an [ordained] person overwhelmed by the same
mental "chain," the same kind of dislike, kills any one of the following:
(1) an animal;
(2) a human or human fetus who is not their father or mother; or else
(3) a human who is their father or mother.
In the first case, you commit the kind of deed known as a "fall." In the second,
you commit a full defeat which is not one of the immediate misdeeds. In the
third case, you commit a full defeat which is one of the immediate misdeeds.

Here next is how downfalls become more or less serious through accumulation.
If you commit from one to five downfalls, and fail to rectify it in the proper
way, it is considered serious to a lesser degree. If you commit downfalls of a
quantity that is countable, and fail to rectify it in the proper way, it is
considered serious to a medium degree. If you commit a number of downfalls
which is beyond all estimation--that is, more than you could ever say just how
many there were--then it is considered serious to a greater degree.

,DE LTAR GSUNGS PA LA 'DIR NI NGO BO NYID DANG GZHI GNYIS JI BZHIN MI SBYAR BAR SKABS DANG BSTUN LA GZHAN GSUM 'DRA'O,
This is how it is explained in scripture; of the three different descriptions
presented there, the ones based on the nature and the object of the deed should
not be applied literally, but rather in the present context. The other three
though are just the same.

,DE LA MI SHES PAS LTUNG BA 'BYUNG BA NI, LTUNG BA MA THOS SHING MA RTOGS PAS BLO MA BYANG BA'I PHYIR LTUNG BA LA LTUNG BA MA YIN PAR 'DU SHES NAS LTUNG BA 'BYUNG BA'O,
Here is what we mean when we say that a person has committed a downfall
out of "ignorance." This is where the downfall is committed because the

person fails to conceive of the downfall as a downfall; this in turn occurs
because the person has not learned what the downfalls are: they have never
studied them, or understood them.

,SHES KYANG LTUNG BA 'BYUNG BA NI LTUNG BA LA BLO BYANG YANG BRJED NGES PA DANG SHES BZHIN MA YIN PAR GNAS PAS DRAN PA NYE BAR MI GNAS PA LAS LTUNG BA 'BYUNG BA'O,
Next is a case where you commit a downfall even though you know it's a
downfall. This happens when the downfall occurs because, despite the fact
that you have learned what all the downfalls are, you fail to keep your mind
on what you are doing. This itself occurs because you forget yourself, or fail
to stay watchful.

,NYON MONGS MANG BAS 'BYUNG BA NI, DUG GSUM SHAS CHE BAS 'DI NI BYA BA MA YIN NO SNYAM DU SHES KYANG RANG DBANG MED PAR 'BYUNG BA'O,
Here's what an "attack of mental affliction" refers to. This happens when one
of the three poisons takes over your mind, and you are helpless to keep
yourself from committing the bad deed; you do it even as you think to
yourself, "This is not something I should be doing."

,MA GUS PAS 'BYUNG BA NI, LTUNG BA LA BLO BYANG YANG DMAN PA LA MOS SHING , SNGON RGYU MA SPYAD PAS DGE SBYONG GI TSUL LA MA LTA ZHING MYANG 'DAS DANG CHOS DANG DGE 'DUN LA MA GUS PA DANG RJE SA MED PA DANG NGO TSA MED PA DANG BSLAB PA MI 'DOD PA DANG MA GUS PAS CI 'DOD DGUR LTUNG BA 'BYUNG BA'O, , DE'I DANG PO GNYIS KYIS NI NYON MONGS PA CAN MA YIN LA PHYI MA GNYIS KYIS NI NYON MONGS CAN KYI LTUNG BA 'BYUNG NGO , ZHES 'DUL BA'I MA MO BSDU BA LAS GSUNGS SO,
Committing a downfall out of a "lack of respect" means that you do so because,
even though you have already learned what the downfalls are, you commit one
of them anyway, for one of the nine reasons that follow: (1) You are still
attracted to a lower level of behavior; or (2) you fail to live the proper causes
in the past, and so you have no appreciation for the way of the practice of
virtue; or you have no respect for (3) the state of nirvana; or (4) the dharma;

or (5) the community; or else (6) you admit no object of veneration; or (7) you
have no sense of shame; or (8) you have no desire to follow the code; or (9)
you feel a kind of disrespect where you will do whatever you feel like doing.
The first two of the above lead to the kind of downfall which does not involve
mental affliction; the latter two lead to the kind which does. All the above is
quoted from the abbreviated form of the principal text on the practice of
discipline.

,LTUNG BA 'BYUNG BA'I RGYU BZHI PO DE DAG GI GNYEN POR LTUNG BA LA MKHAS PA DANG DRAN PA DANG SHES BZHIN BSTEN PA DANG NYON MONGS GANG SHAS CHE BA'I GNYEN PO LA 'BAD PA DANG NGO TSA KHREL YOD DANG STON PA DANG BSLAB PA LA GUS PAR BYA'O,
Here are the antidotes for these four causes that lead you to commit a
downfall:
(1) Make yourself an expert in knowing what the downfalls are.
(2) Keep a high level of mindfulness and vigilance.
(3) Determine which of the mental afflictions is most prevalent in your
character, and make serious efforts to apply the appropriate
spiritual antidote.
(4) Develop a sense of shame, and consideration; maintain deep feelings
of respect for the Teacher, and for the precepts.

DRUG PA BDE BAR GNAS PA'I RGYU NI, BYANG SEMS RANG GI 'DUL BA LA BSLAB PA LA BRTZON PA NI PHUN SUM TSOGS PA GSUM DANG LDAN PAS BDE BA LA REG PAR GNAS SO,
The sixth point in our discussion covers the causes that will keep you in a state
of happiness. A bodhisattva who puts forth serious efforts in keeping the rules
of his code of discipline comes to possess the three fulfillments, and so spends
his or her life in a state of happiness.

PA 'CHAGS PAR BYED PA'O, , 'DIS NI LTUNG BAS DAG PAR MTHONG NAS NYIN DANG MTSAN DU DGA' BA SHAS CHE BAS BDE BA LA REG PAR GNAS SO,
The first fulfillment is that of action. This is where the person first of all
avoids doing anything that would cause his or her morality to lose its purity;
he or she is pure in every action of body, speech, or mind. During the interim,
this person maintains a high level of respect for the precepts, and a strict sense
of care; this makes for a continual period over which he or she is able to avoid
committing any offense. And finally this same person acts to confess any bad
deed that they might by some remote chance happen to commit. He or she
recognizes that they are pure of any downfall, and so pass most of their days
and nights with a feeling of gladness, and thus do they spend their lives in a
state of happiness.

The second fulfillment is that of intention. Here the person takes his or her
ordination with an intention of acting in accord with what the dharma teaches,
and not out of some hope for room and board. They aspire to the great
enlightenment, and are not the kind who have no such aspiration. They aspire
to the way of the practice of virtue, and to nirvana; but they are not the kind
who do not aspire to these things. And because they do aspire so, they make
effort in doing good deeds, and thus they are not the kind who live in
indolence, or whose effort is feeble, or whose deeds are mixed in any way with
what is wrong, and non-virtuous.

The third fulfillment is that of the cause from before. Here the bodhisattva has
in the string of his or her previous lives collected great merit from acts of
giving, and has thus performed the good deeds which allow one to remove
every obstacle to great wealth. As such the bodhisattva will never himself
want for clothing or food or a place to sleep or treatment for illness or any
other kind of material need. And he or she will then be able to share all these
with other persons as well.

The fourth major division of the text concerns the benefits of morality. Here
there are two kinds, the first of which are the ultimate benefits. The great
mountain of bodhisattva morality just described brings the great enlightenment
as its result. That is, keeping this morality as a practice allows one to complete
the perfection of morality, and thus reach the matchless state of Buddhahood.

Here the expression "great mountain" refers to a great amassing of merit: one
which is broad and far-reaching. One can also say that it refers to a practice
of morality which is wide and limitless and totally complete.

In the period up to one's Buddhahood as well, this morality provides some five
different temporal benefits:
(1) As described above, the Buddhas all attend to someone
following this morality.
(2) This same person comes to his final hour in a constant state
of great and ultimate happiness.
(3) Even after his or her body dies, this person is born in a place
where there live bodhisattvas of a similar type--who are
either equal to them in their practice of morality, or even
better--and where there is someone "with whom they
share the Dharma"; that is, where they meet with a
spiritual guide.
(4) In the present life this person is possessed of a limitless
mountain of merit which allows him or her to reach the
final completion of the perfection of morality.
(5) In the future life as well the person reaches a level where he
or she becomes, automatically, an absolute master of this
same morality.

NGAN SONG GI 'JIGS PA MED PA DANG GNYIS LA BSHAD DO,
Jinasutra [Jinamitra?] and others have explained the meaning of the second of
these temporal benefits as follows. They say that a person who keeps this
morality can look ahead to meeting Buddhas and bodhisattvas in his or her
future life. And since they thus transcend any fear of death, they reach a
constant state of great and ultimate happiness. Samudra explains the benefit
as referring to both this and to the fact that, because the person possesses a
limitless store of virtue within themselves, they need not fear the births of
misery.
************
The following selection is taken from the String of Shining Jewels, by Geshe Tsewang
Samdrup (19th century).
Whenever you perform any of the confessions mentioned throughout here you
must do so with all four of the antidote forces complete. Here too is a method
for restoring your vows before the community in the ceremony of restoration
and purification, or on any similar occasion.
First make three prostrations; stay standing then and bow, with your palms
joined at your breast. Speak the following:
I call on all the Buddhas, and every bodhisattva, and the entire
bodhisattva community in every corner of the universe. I am
now going to perform the ceremony for restoring my vows, for
I have made a uncountable number of mistakes while trying to
keep them. In great respect, I request that you listen.
Then crouch down, join your palms at your breast, and repeat the following
three full times:
I call on all the Buddhas, and every bodhisattva, and the entire
bodhisattva community in every corner of the universe. I am the
bodhisattva named (state your own name), and I have made an
uncountable number of mistakes by committing certain actual
deeds, or else actions that are similar to these deeds, which
represent stains of the lesser or medium kind, and are included
into the group of eighteen root downfalls. In particular I have
made the mistake of (choose the appropriate downfall or
downfalls listed next), which is completely against the tradition
of the bodhisattva vows, as described in the following lines, and
other verses from the ancient books which tell how one commits
a root failure.

Because of an attachment to gain or honor,
You praise yourself and criticize others.
From possessiveness you don't give Dharma
Or things to the suffering, with no protector.
You won't listen to another's apology,
And out of anger strike someone else.
You do something to give up the greater way,
You teach a false dharma, or else you steal
Things that belong to the Three Jewels.
These, we say, are the failures of vows.
Beyond these I have made an uncountable number of mistakes
by committing certain actual deeds, or else actions that are
similar to these deeds, which are included into the group of
forty-six secondary offenses. In particular I have made the
mistake of (state the appropriate offense or offenses), which is
completely against the tradition of the bodhisattva vows, as
described in the following lines, and other verses from the
ancient books which tell how one commits the secondary
offenses.
You fail to offer thrice to the Three Jewels,
Or else you let a thought of desire go on.
Beyond these too, I have failed to think, six times each day, of the
good things that come from developing the wish to become
enlightened for all living beings.
I have failed to bring up in my heart, six times per day, the
prayer for this wish for enlightenment.
In my heart, I have given up on certain persons.
I have not made true efforts to amass the two great collections,
of merit and wisdom.
I have not tried to stop the four black actions.
I have not tried to follow the four white actions.
I have not made true efforts to train myself in vowed morality,
and the morality of collecting goodness, and the morality of
working for all living beings.
I have not made true efforts to train myself in the six perfections
of giving and he rest.

I have not made true efforts in working for all living beings
through the four ways of collecting disciples.
When the time came for me to make efforts in preparing Dharma
and material things for those who needed them, I have failed to
make such efforts.
I have grasped to my conceptions of being helped or harmed by
others, and based on that I have distinguished between them,
and begun to take sides, and started then to like some people,
and dislike other people, and not care at all about others.
I have not taken myself to holy ones for instruction.
I have not followed the practices of proper learning and
contemplation in both the profound and the far-reaching
traditions of the bodhisattvas.
When making use of food, or clothes, or various kinds of
furniture, I have failed to do so with thoughts of helping others.
When practicing giving and the rest of the six perfections, I have
failed to do so with a heart filled with thoughts of helping others.
I have failed to make efforts in activities that would bring help
and happiness to others, and that would take away their
suffering.
In short, I have made an uncountable number of mistakes which
are completely against the tradition of the bodhisattva vows. I,
the bodhisattva named (state your name), do hereby admit these
mistakes in the presence of all the Buddhas, and every
bodhisattva, and the entire bodhisattva community from every
corner of the universe. I openly admit them, I hide nothing, I
reveal them all. And I swear that, from this moment on, I will
keep myself from all such deeds.
By admitting all, and revealing all, I shall be at peace; but not
admitting, and not revealing, I cannot be at peace.
When this is said, a person who is fitting to act as the head of the ceremony,
or the like, should repeat three times the question of seeing and restraining:
Do you truly see that these are mistakes?
And then the others should respond,

I do.
Then the head should say,
From now on, will you restrain yourself?
And the others should respond,
From now on, I will.
Alternately they can answer,
I make the most pure and solemn vow to do so, in all keeping
with the Dharma, and the teachings of discipline.
After the three repetitions, the statement of receiving and
affirming should be made.
