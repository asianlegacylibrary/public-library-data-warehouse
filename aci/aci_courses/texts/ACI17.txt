The Disciple's Question

And then the junior monk Subhuti rose from his cushion, and dropped the
corner of his higher robe from one shoulder in a gesture of respect, and
knelt with his right knee to the ground. He faced the Conqueror, joined his
palms at his heart, and bowed. Then he beseeched the Conqueror in the
following words:
************

,BCOM LDAN 'DAS, BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA'I THEG PA LA YANG DAG PAR ZHUGS PAS JI LTAR GNAS PAR BGYI, JI LTAR BSGRUB PAR BGYI, JI LTAR SEMS RAB TU GZUNG BAR BGYI, DE SKAD CES GSOL PA DANG ,
O Conqueror, what of those who have entered well into the way of
the bodhisattva? How shall they live? How shall they practice? How
should they keep their thoughts?

The Disciple is Revealed

And since it is so, o Subhuti, listen now to what I speak, and
be sure that it stays firmly in your heart, for I shall reveal to
you how it is that those who have entered well into the way of
the bodhisattva should live, and how they should practice, and
how they should keep their thoughts.

"Thus shall it be," replied the junior monk Subhuti, and he sat to listen as
instructed by the Conqueror. The Conqueror too then began, with the
following words...

LAN LA RAB 'BYOR GYIS BCOM LDAN 'DAS DE DE BZHIN NO ZHES GSOL NAS BCOM LDAN 'DAS KYI GSUNGS PA LTAR MNYAN PA DANG , BCOM LDAN 'DAS KYIS RAB 'BYOR LA 'CHAD PAR 'GYUR BA 'DI SKAD CES BKA' STZAL TO, , RAB 'BYOR 'DI NYAN THOS KYI TSUL BZUNG BA TZAM MA GTOGS, DON LA 'JAM DPAL GYI SPRUL PAR SNANG LA, STON PAS YUM GSUNGS PA'I TSE RAB 'BYOR NYID YUM GYI MDO THOG MAR 'CHAD PA POR BSGOS TE DGONGS GZHI CHE'O,
In reply then Subhuti proffers to the Conqueror, "Thus shall it be." He sits
to listen as instructed by the Conqueror, and the Conqueror too begins his
explanation with the words that follow.
This Subhuti, by the way, is only posing as a disciple: in reality he would
appear to be an emanation of Manjushri himself. When the Teacher spoke the
sutras on the Mother of the Buddhas, it was none other than Subhuti that he
would appoint to give the opening presentations--and there is a special
significance to why he did so.

The Buddha's Reply: the Wish for Enlightenment

Subhuti, this is how those who have entered well into the way of the
bodhisattva must think to themselves as they feel the Wish to achieve
enlightenment:
I will bring to nirvana the total amount of living beings, every
single one numbered among the ranks of living kind. . .
However many living beings there are, in whatever realms
there may be--anyone at all labelled with the name of "living
being"--all these will I bring to total nirvana, to the sphere
beyond all grief, where none of the parts of the person are left
at all.
Yet even if I do manage to bring this limitless number of living
beings to total nirvana, there will be no living being at all who
was brought to total nirvana.

Lord Buddha wants us to understand that this Wish for enlightenment must
be imbued with that correct view wherein you perceive that nothing has a self-
nature. This is why He states that we must develop a Wish for enlightenment
where we intend to lead this limitless number of living beings to the nirvana
beyond both extremes, but where at the same time we realize that, even if we
do manage to bring them to this total nirvana, there will be no living being
at all who achieved it, and who also existed in an ultimate sense.

On the Meaning of "Nirvana"

,'DIR MYA NGAN ZHES 'BYUNG BA NI MYA NGAN NI LAS NYON GNYIS DANG SDUG BSNGAL TE DE LAS BZLAS PA NI LAS NYON DANG SDUG BSNGAL LAS THAR PA 'AM 'DAS PA'I MYANG 'DAS SO, , DES NA BZLAS ZHES PA NI MYANG 'DAS DANG DE LA 'GOD PA'I DON DU YANG 'GYUR RO, , GZHUNG 'DIS SO SKYE LA DON DAM SEMS BSKYED RJES MTHUN PA ZHIG BSTAN CING , DON DAM SEMS BSKYED DNGOS KYANG BSTAN TE 'PHAGS PA KHO NA YOD DO,
The Tibetan term for "nirvana" means "passing beyond sorrow." The "sorrow"
mentioned here refers to the pair of karma and mental afflictions, as well as to
suffering. The nirvana to which you wish to bring beings then refers to a state
of escaping from the combination of karma and bad thoughts, along with
suffering: it means to go beyond them. This is why the unusual Tibetan verb
here refers not only to nirvana, but to the act of bringing someone to nirvana
as well. The root text at this point is meant to indicate that ordinary beings
can possess something that approximates the ultimate Wish for enlightenment.
It is also indicating the existence of the actual ultimate Wish for enlightenment,
which only realized beings possess.

The Object which Emptiness Denies

Now each and every existing object, be it part of the afflicted part of existence
or part of the pure side, is established as existing only by virtue of terms. If
one performs an analysis with reasoning which examines an object in an
ultimate sense, no object can bear such examination, and we fail to locate what
we gave our label. Here the thing we deny is easier to deny if we can identify
it clearly. As such I will speak a bit about what this thing we deny is like.

DGAG BYA LA SPYIR 'DOD TSUL MANG YANG 'DIR DBU MA THAL 'GYUR BA'I LUGS LTAR BSHAD PAR BYA'O, , DE YANG MDO LAS, DE DAG RTOG PA'I DBANG GIS BZHAG PA YIN, , ZHES DANG , BZHI BRGYA PA'I 'GREL PA LAS, RTOG PA YOD PA KHO NAS YOD PA NYID DANG ZHES SOGS DANG , RJES DGONGS PA RAB GSAL LAS, CHOS RNAMS RTOG PA'I DBANG GIS BZHAG PAR GSUNGS TE, CHOS THAMS CAD RTOG PAS BTAGS PA TZAM DANG RTOG PA'I DBANG GIS BZHAG PAR GSUNGS PA MANG NGO ZHES GSUNGS PA LTAR,
Generally speaking there are a great number of different positions that exist
about what the object we deny exactly is. Here though I will give my
explanation according to the position of the Consequence section of the Middle
Way school.
A certain sutra says that "They are all established through concepts." The
Commentary to the Four Hundred too contains lines such as the one which says,
"It is only due to the existence of concepts that existence itself can exist, and..."
The Lord, in his Illumination of the True Thought, says as well that "These lines
[from sutra] are describing how all existing things are established by force of
concepts [or perceptions forced on us by our previous deeds]. We see many
other such statements as well, to the point that all existing objects are simply
labelled with our concepts, and are established only by force of concepts."

CHOS THAMS CAD RTOG PAS BTAGS PA'I DPE NI, THAG PA KHRA BO YUL MI GSAL BA NA GNAS PA'I TSE KHA CIG LA 'DI SBRUL LO SNYAM PA'I BLO 'BYUNG NGO , , DE'I TSE THAG PA DE'I TSOGS PA DANG CHA SHAS GANG YANG SBRUL DU MED KYANG , DE LA SBRUL LO SNYAM PA'I SBRUL NI RTOG PAS BTAGS PA TZAM DU 'CHAR RO,
There is a metaphor used to describe how all existing things are labelled with
our concepts. When you put a rope with a checkered pattern on it in a dark
corner, some people might get the impression that it's a snake. The truth at
this point though is that nothing about the rope is a snake: neither the rope as
a whole, nor the parts of the rope. Nonetheless the person thinks of the rope
as a snake, and this snake is an example of something which only makes its
appearance as something labelled with a concept.

,DE BZHIN DU PHUNG PO 'DI LA BRTEN NAS NGA'O SNYAM DU 'BYUNG YANG , PHUNG PO'I TSOGS PA DANG RGYUN DANG CHA SHAS GANG YANG NGA'I MTSAN GZHIR 'JOG RGYU MED CING , PHUNG PO LAS NGO BO THA DAD PA GZHAN ZHIG KYANG NGA'I MTSAN GZHIR BZUNG MED PAS, NGA DE NI PHUNG PO LA BRTEN NAS BTAGS PA TZAM YIN GYI, RANG GI NGO BO NYID KYIS GRUB PA MED DO,
In the same way, the heaps of parts that make us up serve as a basis for us to
get the impression "This is me." There is nothing at all about these heaps as
a whole, nor their continuation over time, nor their separate components, that
we could establish as being an actual representation of "me."
At the same time though there is nothing else, nothing essentially separate
from these heaps of parts to ourselves, that we could consider an actual
representation of "me" either. As such, this "me" is merely something labelled
upon the heaps of parts that make us up; there is nothing which exists by its
own essence.
************

,DES NA BRTEN NAS BYUNG BA DANG BRTEN NAS BTAGS PA MA YIN PA'I CHOS MED PAS, BRTEN NAS BTAGS PA MA YIN PAR YOD PA DE BRTAG PA MTHA' GZUNG GI DGAG BYA'I

,DE PHYIR STONG PA MA YIN PA'I,
,CHOS 'GA' YOD PA MA YIN NO,
,ZHES GSUNGS SO,
Given the above, there does not exist anything which does not occur in
dependence, or which is not labelled through a dependent relationship.
Therefore the point at which we can say something is the object denied by our
search for a hypothetical self-existent thing would be any time that thing
existed without having been labelled through a dependent relationship. This
too is why the Root Text on Wisdom states:
No object which does not occur
Through dependence even exists at all;
As such no object could exist
At all if it weren't empty.

Emptiness and the Wish for Enlightenment

,DE CI'I PHYIR ZHE NA, RAB 'BYOR, GAL TE BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA' SEMS CAN DU 'DU SHES 'JUG NA, DE BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA' ZHES MI BYA BA'I PHYIR RO,
Why is it so? Because, Subhuti, if a bodhisattva were to conceive of
someone as a living being, then we could never call him a "bodhisattva."

,GONG GI PHRO NI, BDEN PAR GRUB PA'I SEMS CAN GANG YANG MYANG 'DAS THOB PA MED PAR SEMS BSKYED DGOS PA'I RGYU MTSAN LA DE CI'I PHYIR ZHE NA, RAB 'BYOR ZHES BOS NAS GAL TE BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA' GANG SEMS CAN LA SEMS CAN DU BDEN PAR GRUB 
PA'I 'DU SHES 'JUG NA, BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA' DE BDAG MED RTOGS PA'I BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA' ZHES MI BYA'O,
Here we return to where we left off in the root text. One may ask, "Why is it
so? What reason is there for saying that we should develop a Wish for
enlightenment, while still understanding that there is no truly existing sentient
being at all who ever achieves it?" Lord Buddha first calls Subhuti by name,
and then explains that we could never call any particular bodhisattva a
"bodhisattva who had realized the meaning of no-self-nature" if this
bodhisattva were to conceive of any living being as a living being who
existed truly.
7
Perfect Giving, with an Understanding of Emptiness

,DE CI'I PHYIR ZHE NA, RAB 'BYOR, BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA' GANG MI GNAS PAR SBYIN PA SBYIN PA DE'I BSOD NAMS KYI PHUNG PO NI, RAB 'BYOR, TSAD GZUNG BAR SLA BA MA YIN PA'I PHYIR RO,
Why is that? Think, o Subhuti, of the mountains of merit
collected by any bodhisattva who performs the act of giving
without staying. This merit, o Subhuti, is not something that
you could easily ever measure.

,BDEN 'DZIN GYIS BCINGS PA'I SBYIN SOGS LAS BSOD NAMS CHEN PO 'BYUNG MOD, BDEN 'DZIN GYIS BCINGS PA DANG BRAL BA'I SGO NAS SBYIN SOGS BSGRUB PA NA BSOD NAMS LHAG PAR CHE BAR NGES ZHES STON PA NI, DE CI'I PHYIR ZHE NA, RAB 'BYOR BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA' GANG MI GNAS PAR SBYIN PA SBYIN PA DE'I BSOD NAMS KYI PHUNG PO CHE BA'I MTHA' TSAD NI GZHAN GYIS GZUNG BAR SLA BA MIN TE DKA' BA'I PHYIR RO,
One would have to admit that a person locked in the chains of grasping to
some true existence can collect a great amount of merit through acts of giving
and the like. But suppose a person is able to practice giving and the rest after

he has freed himself from these same chains. His merit then is certain to be
ever much greater. And it is to emphasize this point that the Buddha says,
Why is that? Think, o Subhuti, of the mountains of merit collected by any
bodhisattva who performs the act of giving without staying. This merit is
not something whose limit you could easily ever measure; in fact, it would
be quite difficult to measure.

O Subhuti, what do you think? Would it be easy to measure
the space to the east of us?
And Subhuti replied,
O Conqueror, it would not.
The Conqueror bespoke:
And just so, would it be easy to measure the space to the south
of us, or to the north of us, or above us, or below us, or in any
of the ordinal directions from us? Would it be easy to measure
the space to any of the ten directions from where we now
stand?
And Subhuti replied,
O Conqueror, it would not.

The Conqueror bespoke:
And just so, o Subhuti, it would be no easy thing to measure
the mountains of merit collected by any bodhisattva who
performs the act of giving without staying.

The root text here is presenting an example. It would be no easy thing to
measure the space to the east or any of the rest of the ten directions reaching
out from the particular point where we are now. Then the Buddha
summarizes the point of the example with the words that start with "Just so,
Subhuti..."

The Emptiness of the Bodies of a Buddha

,RAB 'BYOR, 'DI JI SNYAM DU SEMS, MTSAN PHUN SUM TSOGS PAS DE BZHIN GSHEGS PAR BLTA'AM, RAB 'BYOR GYIS GSOL PA, BCOM LDAN 'DAS, DE NI, MA LAGS TE, MTSAN PHUN SUM TSOGS PAS DE BZHIN GSHEGS PAR MI BLTA'O, , DE CI'I SLAD DU ZHE NA, DE BZHIN GSHEGS PAS MTSAN PHUN SUM TSOGS PAR GANG GSUNGS PA DE NYID MTSAN PHUN SUM TSOGS PA MA MCHIS PA'I SLAD DU'O, , DE SKAD CES GSOL PA DANG , BCOM LDAN 'DAS KYIS TSE DANG LDAN PA RAB 'BYOR LA 'DI SKAD CES BKA' STZAL TO,
O Subhuti, what do you think? Should we consider someone
to be the One Thus Gone because he possesses the totally
exquisite marks on a Buddha's body?

And Subhuti replied,
O Conqueror, we should not. We should not consider someone
the One Thus Gone because he possesses the totally exquisite
marks on a Buddha's body. And why not? Because when the
One Thus Gone himself described the totally exquisite marks
on a Buddha's body, he stated at the same time that they were
impossible.
And then the Conqueror spoke to the junior monk Subhuti again, as follows:
 , SBYIN SOGS BSOD NAMS KYI TSOGS LAS SANGS RGYAS KYI GZUGS SKU 'GRUB PAR 'GYUR ZHING , GZUGS KYI SKU NI MTSAN DPES BRGYAN PA'O, , RAB 'BYOR 'DI JI SNYAM DU SEMS ZHES PA NI, RAB 'BYOR KHYOD KYIS DON 'DI LA JI LTAR YIN SNYAM DU SEMS PA STE BSAM, DE BZHIN GSHEGS PA'I GZUGS KYI SKU RNAM PA GNYIS NI MTSAN DPE PHUN SUM TSOGS PA DANG LDAN PA YIN MOD, 'ON KYANG MTSAN DPE PHUN SUM TSOGS PA YOD PA DE TZAM GYIS DE BZHIN GSHEGS PAR LTA BA STE 'DOD PAR BYA BA YIN SNYAM MA'AM ZHES DRIS PA NA, RAB 'BYOR GYIS BCOM LDAN 'DAS DE NI DE LTAR BLTA BA MA LAGS SO ZHES GSOL TE, CUNG ZAD DBYE BA NI MTSAN DPE PHUN SUM TSOGS PA YOD PA DE TZAM GYIS DE BZHIN GSHEGS PAR BLTA BAR MI BGYID DE, DE CI'I SLAD DU ZHE NA, DE BZHIN GSHEGS PAS GZUGS KYI SKU'I MTSAN DPE PHUN SUM TSOGS PA GANG GSUNGS PA DE NYID KUN RDZOB TU SGYU MA LTAR YOD PAR GSUNGS KYI, DON DAM PAR MTSAN DPE PHUN SUM TSOGS PA MA MCHIS PA'I SLAD DU'O ZHES GSOL TO,
The merit of acts such as giving and the rest bring us the physical body of a
Buddha, and this physical body is adorned with various marks and signs. The
words "Subhuti, what do you think?" mean "Subhuti, turn your mind to this
subject, and think about how it could be--contemplate upon it."

The Buddha then asks Subhuti, "Assume for a minute that someone possessed
the totally exquisite marks and signs, or the two physical bodies, of the One
Thus Gone. Would that in itself require us to consider him--that is, assert
that he is--the One Thus Gone? What do you think?"
Subhuti replies to the Buddha with the words starting off from, "We should
not consider him so." At this point we have to draw a slight distinction. One
should not necessarily consider someone the One Thus Gone simply because
he possesses the totally exquisite marks and signs. "And why not?" says
Subhuti. He answers himself by saying, "Because when the One Thus Gone
himself described the totally exquisite marks and signs on a Buddha's body,
he stated at the same time that they existed deceptively, in the way of an
illusion. Signs and marks of this kind that existed ultimately, however, would
be a complete impossibility."

O Subhuti, what do you think? The totally exquisite marks on
a Buddha's body, as such, are deceptive. The totally exquisite
marks on a Buddha's body are also not deceptive, but only
insofar as they do not exist. Thus you should see the One
Thus Gone as having no marks, no marks at all.
Thus did the Conqueror speak. And then the junior monk Subhuti replied
to the Conqueror, as follows:

,GZUGS SKU'I MTSAN DPE RNAMS NI RI MOS BRIS PA'I GZUGS BRNYAN LTAR RKYEN TSOGS PA LAS BYUNG BA'I KUN RDZOB BRDZUN PA'I GNAS TSUL YIN GYI, BDEN PA'I RANG BZHIN MIN NO ZHES STON PA NI, BCOM LDAN 'DAS KYIS RAB 'BYOR LA CI TZAM DU MTSAN PHUN SUM TSOGS PA DE TZAM DU BRDZUN NO ZHES GSUNGS, 'O NA MI BRDZUN PA GANG ZHE NA, JI TZAM DU MTSAN DPE PHUN SUM TSOGS PA RNAMS BDEN PAR MED PA DE TZAM NI MI BRDZUN

The marks and signs on the physical body of the Buddha are like an image
drawn on a piece of paper: they are not the real thing--they exist in a
deceptive manner, as things that occur when all of their causes have gathered
together. They do not exist as something with a true nature. To indicate this
fact, Lord Buddha says to Subhuti, "Insofar as the totally exquisite marks on
a Buddha's body exist, as such they are deceptive.
"Just what," you may ask, "is meant by the word deceptive?" The totally
exquisite marks and signs on a Buddha's body are also not deceptive, and
true, but only insofar as they do not exist truly. Thus you should see the
One Thus Gone as having no marks, no marks to indicate his nature, at all.
The section here helps to prevent us from falling into either one of the two
extremes. The physical body of the Buddha and its various marks and signs
do exist--albeit in a deceptive way, in a false or empty way--and this fact
keeps us from the extreme of denying the existence of something which
actually does exist.
The text though also states that there exist no marks, and no marks that would
indicate any nature, which also exist truly. This fact keeps us from the extreme
of asserting the existence of something which actually does not exist. The
former of these two [marks] is referring to the physical body of a Buddha. The
latter is referring to the dharma body, and chiefly to the essence body.

And the Conqueror bespoke,
O Subhuti, you should never ask the question you have just
asked: "What will happen in the future, in the days of the last
five hundred, when the Dharma is approaching its final
destruction? How could anyone of those times ever see

And again the Buddha bespoke,
O Subhuti, in the future, in the days of the last five hundred, when
the holy Dharma is approaching its final destruction, there will come
bodhisattvas who are great beings, who possess morality, who possess
the fine quality, and who possess wisdom.
And these bodhisattvas who are great beings, o Subhuti, will not be
ones who have rendered honor to a single Buddha, or who have
collected stores of virtue with a single Buddha. Instead, o Subhuti,
they will be ones who have rendered honor to many hundreds of
thousands of Buddhas, and who have collected stores of virtue with
many hundreds of thousands of Buddhas. Such are the bodhisattvas,
the great beings, who then will come.

Master Kamalashila explains the expression "days of the last five hundred" as
follows:
"Five hundred" here refers to a group of five hundreds; it refers
to the well-known saying that "The teachings of the Conqueror
will remain for five times five hundred."
As such, the "five times five hundred" refers to the length of time that the
teachings will remain in the world: 2,500 years.

O Subhuti, what do you think? Suppose some son or daughter

system, a system with a thousand of a thousand of a thousand
planets, and fill them all up with the seven kinds of precious
substances, and offer them to someone. Would that son or

from such a deed?

With this next section of the sutra, Lord Buddha wishes to demonstrate a
certain fact. In the sections above we have spoken about the act of becoming
enlightened, and of teaching the dharma, and so on. Neither these, nor any
other object in the universe, exists ultimately. Nonetheless, they do exist
nominally. As such, one would have to admit that anyone who performs an
act of giving does acquire great merit thereby. Yet anyone who carries out the
process of learning, or contemplating, or meditating upon this teaching
acquires infinitely greater merit.

And Subhuti replied,
O Conqueror, many would it be. O Conqueror, it would be
many. This son or daughter of noble family would indeed
create many great mountains of merit from such a deed. And
why so? Because, o Conqueror, these same great mountains of
merit are great mountains of merit that could never exist. And
for this very reason do the Ones Thus Gone speak of "great
mountains of merit, great mountains of merit."

In response, Subhuti replies:
It would be many great mountains of merit--and these great
mountains of merit are mountains of merit that we could
establish as existing only in name, only in the way that a dream
or an illusion exists: these same great mountains of merit
though could never exist as mountains that existed ultimately.
The Ones Thus Gone as well speak in a nominal sense of "great
mountains of merit, great mountains of merit"--applying the
name to them.

And the Conqueror bespoke:
O Subhuti, suppose some son or daughter of noble family were
to take all the planets of this great world system, a system with
a thousand of a thousand of a thousand planets, and fill them
all up with the seven kinds of precious substances, and offer
them to someone. Suppose on the other hand that one of them
held but a single verse of four lines from this particular
dharma, and explained it to others, and taught it correctly. By
doing the latter, this person would create many more great
mountains of merit than with the former: they would be
countless, and beyond all estimation.

We should first say something about the word "verse" here. Although the
sutra in Tibetan is not written in verse, the idea is that one could put it into
verse in Sanskrit. The word "hold" refers to "holding in the mind," or
memorizing. It can also apply to holding a volume in one's hand and, in either
case, reciting the text out loud.
The phrase "explain it correctly" is explained as stating the words of the sutra
and explaining them well. The phrase "teach it correctly" is explained as
teaching the meaning of the sutra well, and this is the most important part.
Suppose now that one held the sutra and did the other things mentioned with
it, rather than the other good deed described. This person would then create
great mountains of merit that were ever more countless, and beyond all
estimation.

Why is it so? Because, Subhuti, this is where the matchless
and totally perfect enlightenment of the Ones Thus Gone, the
Destroyers of the Foe, the Totally Enlightened Buddhas, comes
from. It is from this as well that the Buddhas, the Conquerors,
are born.

The reason for this is as follows. The act of giving someone the dharma is of
much more benefit that the act of giving material things. Not only that, but
the enlightenment of the totally enlightened Buddhas comes from--is
achieved through--the perfection of wisdom: the realization of emptiness
which forms the subject matter of this text. It is from putting this into practice
as well that the Buddhas, the Conquerors, are born.

The Asian Classics Institute
Course XVII: The Great Ideas of Buddhism, Part Two
Reading Two: The Diamond Cutter Sutra, Part Two
We begin with a selection from The Garden which describes something of the
experience of the direct realization of emptiness.
11
The Direct Perception of Emptiness
And so I, the quiet bookworm, began leading the life of a Warrior, secretly.
It was a truly new experience, a new way of experiencing the world in which
I had always lived, for the battlefield of this particular Warrior was the same
old library, and my little room at the hermitage, and the alley down which I
travelled to go to market for my vegetables in the evening. I really did feel
like a different person, for I had a totally different purpose than I had had in
the past. Going through life before had seemed like walking down a
boulevard lined with shops; I was a shopper, a consumer, looking into the
windows to see if there was something I wanted, and then doing whatever was
necessary to get what I wanted.
Life as the Warrior was entirely different. I really was a knight in shining
armor, and walking on my two little feet was like riding some great powerful
horse, and looking around myself at the library or on the road was like
viewing some great vista from a seat of royalty: I looked at all my subjects, all
my children, around me, and dreamt up ways of serving them, of keeping
them happy, and assuring their future and ultimate happiness. I gave them
all I could, kind words, kindly looks, a pat on the back, what little money I
had, and a few words of encouragement, with as much of the spiritual as I
thought they could hear happily; while in the back of my mind I was also
offering them great piles of jewels, deep spiritual realizations, all the things in
the world that no man claimed his own--the blue of the sky, the sound of the
sea, the flowers that grew on every mountain on the planet, and I did so
sincerely, although no one ever knew, and I did so with the wish that all I
offered they could one day possess, especially enlightenment itself, and above
all I found a deep and contented joy growing within myself daily, hour by
hour.

As the joy increased my thirst increased, for I knew that my lessons were not
complete, and like a horse near water I knew I was near, nearer and nearer,
and I felt nearly an obsession now to reach the goals I knew now were
reachable: I wanted to find perfection, I knew I could reach my mother, I knew
she was near now, and instinct told me that I was close enough now to see the
Golden One again as well, and that the end of my searching, and the finding
of what I sought, and my mother, and the masters of the Garden, and the
Golden One would all before long join one with the other. And so I went
again to the Garden, thinking that perhaps the night for this had come.
I remember distinctly the date it happened, nothing could make me forget, it
was the 28th of July, and summer at its height. I entered the Garden late at
night, well after the earth had cooled from the heat of the day, and sat on the
foot of the bench beneath the carob, drinking in the sweet smell of the desert
breezes, sweet respite from the still and burning feel of the daytime, a feel that
struck the face and dried the nose and eyes, like the wind from an oven.
I sat and prepared to enter meditation, going through the preparatory steps
slowly, with relish, as though I were putting on a soft old glove, or beginning
a conversation with some dear old friend. I was nearly finished when I sensed
a motion at the gate of the Garden, and then a small form moving quietly
down the row of crimson desert roses along the northern wall. The form
stooped at one bush, as though saying a silent prayer, and then moved off
again.
I caught sight of the head of a monk, well-formed and cropped short, with
velvet-like black hair, and then the robes and body followed. I had not seen
much more than these brief clues before I found myself involuntarily on my
feet, with my palms joined at my breast, bowed in deep respect. I glanced up
almost in fear, in awe, for before me was Gautama, the Buddha himself, and
although he was nothing like what I might have expected, there was absolutely
no denying, and no questioning, who He was.
He was not tall, but only medium in height, and his frame was somewhat
slight, and slightly bent, in a kind of modesty that nearly seemed like shyness.
His every gesture was simple and graceful, as was his entire appearance, and
his robes: clean, graceful, simply hung on his simple form, soft and natural
with a lifetime of wear. His age no one could have guessed, I suppose I would
say about 27 or 28, but his face gave no certain clue. It was simple itself, and
the first impression, beside the modesty, was one of simple honesty: the eyes
were gentle and open, rarely blinking, often down in modesty, and there was
a quiet happiness in the way his face was held--in the slight but graceful
smile, and the smooth, intelligent face. His skin and the rest were the same as
yours or mine, it was not as though he were blazing in light or anything of the
like, but there was a different kind of radiance about him, one with no color
or shape, a kind of clear warmth that bathed his eyes and face, and his gentle

hands, all the way down to his humble, bare feet; and this warmth radiated
forth and filled the Garden, and bathed my being, and bade me to bow, before
One who seemed to neither need nor wish any bow. And I bowed.
"Sit," he spoke quietly, "sit, please sit." And I sat instinctively there, on the
grass before the bench, and bowed again sitting, praying that he himself would
sit there, on the bench. This he did quite naturally, although with a bit of
hesitation, as though he did not consider himself worthy of such a throne.
And he sat quietly, looking down at the grass, almost abashed, like a young
girl alone before a stranger. We sat quietly.
After some time he reached his hand out towards me, and I saw that he had
plucked one of the red roses from the bushes on his way in. He didn't speak,
he only held it out towards me, as if asking me to look at it, which I did. No
words passed between us, I simply looked at the rose, and have no idea what
he himself may have been looking at, for I felt still too much in awe of him to
gaze into his face.
He withdrew then the rose suddenly, and put three of his fingers under my
chin, and raised my face slowly up to meet his eyes. And then he said "Rose,"
and reached the same fingers of both hands to my eyelids, and closed them,
and kept his fingers there. In my mind I pictured a rose, a perfect red rose.
Then his fingers opened my eyes again, and he reached out towards me again,
holding the rose, and said, "Do not think 'rose'." And I tried not to think 'rose,'
I tried not to see the picture I had just seen of the rose, and I looked into his
hand again. For just an instant, for just a brief flash, I saw a tiny corner of red,
outlined against the dark of the night air, and then my eye jumped and saw
something roundish and red, further down, and finally something green, and
thin, and straight. And then in the next moment I was again looking at a rose.
"Again," he said simply.
He let me look at the rose, and then he pulled back his hand, and then he
gently closed my eyelids, and then he said again, "Rose." I thought of 'rose,'
there was the outline and color of a rose in my thoughts, and then he gently
pushed my eyes open again, and again said "Do not think 'rose'." And then
he opened his hand before me, and again, for a moment, my eyes danced
across some colors and shapes, before an instant later I saw a rose in my mind,
and before my eyes.
Then he stooped and touched his finger to the ground, and brought up on the
tip of it a tiny black ant. He touched his finger to the side of the rose, and let
the ant climb onto the rose; the ant began to race across the petals, leaning out
over thin air and then reversing itself, racing across to the opposite side,
leaning out in the air, nearly falling off the rose, and then racing further on

again, in an obvious panic. Gautama touched the rose to the ground, and the
black ant raced off into the blades of the grass.
And then he cupped the rose in his hand, and all I could see was the back of
his hand. He held the hand to his face, and opened his deep brown eyes wide,
and with his head slightly cocked to the side looked at the rose himself, gazed
upon the rose. All I could see was his eyes, but in his eyes I saw some kind
of extraordinary contentment, some kind of extraordinary happiness with the
rose, and I knew in that moment that he was seeing something that I could
never in my present condition ever see: he was experiencing some profound
state of bliss triggered by the same thing that I had looked at, and I knew at
that moment that it could not be the same thing I had looked at. Gautama
closed his hand gently around the rose, and turned those shining eyes to mine.
"For a moment," he said quietly, "you saw the rose before you thought 'rose,'
and it was only a few simple shapes and pieces of color. Then your mind
thought of these as 'rose.' The poor ant also perceived these same shapes and
colors, but thought only 'threat,' and then 'death,' and ran for his life. When
I looked at these same colors and pieces of shape, I saw all of eternity, and all
the minds of every being in existence, and loved them."
Gautama paused, and closed his eyes, as if waiting for my mind to grasp his
words, and then think on them clearly, before he continued. And then he
reached out his hand again, and opened it, and asked me, "Who saw this thing
right? What is this thing? Is it a rose? Is it the Lord of Death? Is it all
humanity, and perfect love?"
In his presence I felt as though my mind were someone else's, as though it
belonged to some great and enlightened saint, and I had no hesitation to
answer, and no need to answer in words. The thing he had in his hand was
each of these things, and all of these things, and none of these things. It was
to each of the three beings who looked upon it truly what they saw; it was in
sum all the things it appeared to be to all three; and it could never have been
three completely different things at once. It was what each saw it to be.
He closed his hand again, and paused again. He leaned and whispered to me,
fiercely, "See it now as eternity; see it now as all humanity, and know the
perfect love for them that I do." And then he opened his hand again, and in
almost a trance of joy I looked eagerly into the palm and saw--a simple, red,
rose.
I closed my eyes in disappointment, and said only, "I cannot."
"I know," he said.
"Why?"

"You know very well; you see only what your mind forces you to see; you see
only what the imprints in your mind allow you to see, even though you are
looking upon exactly the same thing that I am looking upon, when I see all of
eternity, and all of life, and feel all love for it."
I closed my eyes and thought "Rose." I opened my eyes and saw "Rose." He
raised his legs up to the bench and crossed them, under his robes, and went
into meditation. I crossed my legs, and I went into meditation. The silence
grew. I lost the sounds of the Garden, and then I lost the smells and feel of
the Garden, and then I lost the feeling of sitting in the Garden, and then finally
I lost the feeling even of thinking, and even of myself. It was perfectly and
totally still.
I saw emptiness. And it was only that, and I saw it. There was nothing else.
When it was over things began to come back. I was aware of coming down,
and then I was aware of myself again. I was aware then, in that moment, for
the first time, that I had seen emptiness.
I knew then that I had seen an Enlightened One, and so I knew then that
Enlightened Ones really existed.
I knew then, perfectly, that I would myself become an Enlightened One, in the
space of seven lifetimes, and so I knew then that my future lives really existed.
I knew then that the Path was perfectly true.
I knew they would not call me by my name when I became an Enlightened
One.
I knew the seven lives would be good, no more real suffering, and surrounded
by loving parents, and good and learned teachers, and spiritual friends and
teachings, exactly as I needed, without fail.
I knew that what I had seen was true. I could never doubt these things again.
I knew I was not mistaken, I knew I was not somehow deluded or crazy. I
knew that no one, ever, could say anything that would ever make me doubt
what I had seen.
I knew that I knew what every holy book in the world said; I knew that I
knew the great ocean of knowledge entirely, as though it were reduced to a
teardrop in a child's eye. And I knew the truth of these holy books, and I
knew I must give my life to keep them in this world, for others to come after
me.
I loved every living thing. A light came out of my chest, a powerful pillar of

light, with no color, and it went out, and it touched every living thing, and I
knew then that I would always live for each of them, and only for them, and
that there was nothing else for me ever to do.
I knew that pictures of the Enlightened Ones were true. I knew we had to care
for them. I knew that I must bow down to them, and when it was time to rise,
I threw myself on the ground before Them.
I knew I had seen a different reality, a true reality, a truly higher and pure
reality. I knew there was no thing like this reality in the reality I had known.
I knew that the reality I had known was not a pure reality. I knew there was
nothing in this reality that could ever be pure. But I knew that, of all the
things in this reality, the diamond was one thing that was in some small way
close to being pure, purely hard, purely clear, and pure throughout, nearly.
I knew I would die. I knew my mind was not yet pure. I knew my mind was
seeing things wrong, and always had, until the moment I saw emptiness. I
knew that even now, once I had come down, I was again seeing things wrong,
and would continue to do so until I was nearly enlightened. I knew I could
read minds. I knew that, if I developed myself carefully, I could perform
miracles.
I knew I was now someone different because, of all the people in the world,
I had seen emptiness, and I had seen all these other things, and I no longer had
to suffer like before. It was over with; I was on my way out, with certainty,
with a sweet certainty that I would carry with me forever after.
I looked up to Gautama, in gratitude. He gazed down at me, in total silence,
and complete joy. He knew everything.

O Conqueror, I declare that the Ones Thus Gone--those Destroyers
of the Foe who are the Totally Enlightened Buddhas--reside in the
highest of all those states that are free of the mental afflictions. I am,
o Conqueror, a person who is free of desire; I am a foe destroyer.
But I do not, o Conqueror, think to myself, "I am a foe destroyer." For
suppose, o Conqueror, that I did think to myself, "I have attained this
very state, the state of a foe destoyer." If I did think this way, then
the One Thus Gone could never have given me the final prediction:
he could never have said: "O son of noble family, o Subhuti, you will
reach the highest of all those states that are free of the mental
afflictions. Because you stay in no state at all, you have reached the
state free of mental afflictions; you have reached what we call the
'state free of mental afflictions.'

In an ultimate sense then there is nothing for one to achieve, and nothing that
helps one achieve it, and no one even to do the achieving. But we can say
even further that, again speaking ultimately, there is no dharma at all that one
takes up, and practices.

At some point you will gain a really correct understanding of how, despite the
fact that results do come from causes, they do not come from these causes
through any nature of their own. At that moment you will finally grasp the
way in which Middle-Way philosophy describes how, despite the fact that
things are empty of any natural existence, they can still quite properly work
and function as they do. At that point too you will have discovered the
Middle Way itself, the path where the appearance of the normal world and
emptiness itself are inseparably married together.

How the Failure to Understand Emptiness
Causes Mental Afflictions

Why is it so? Because, o Subhuti, there was a time when the
King of Kalingka was cutting off the larger limbs, and smaller
appendages, of my body. At that moment there came into my
mind no conception of a self, nor or of a sentient being, nor of
a living being, nor of a person--I had no conception at all. But
neither did I not have any conception.

For what reason is it so? Because long ago there was a time, o Subhuti, when
the king of Kalingka got the evil suspicion that I had engaged in relations
with his woman. And so he was cutting off the larger limbs, and smaller
appendages of my body. (The latter refers to the fingers and toes.)
At that moment I practiced patience, keeping my mind on an understanding
of the lack of true existence to each of the three elements to the act of patience.
As I focussed on the "me" which exists nominally, there came into my mind
no conception where I held any belief in some truly existing "me": and so I
had no conception of anything from a truly existing "self" up to a truly
existing "person."
At that moment I had no conception at all of any such conception that
something was existing truly. At the same time though it was neither as if I
had no other, nominal conceptions at all. What Subhuti is saying here is the
following. I did have the thought that I would have to keep my patience: I did
have the thought to take the pain on willingly, and not to be upset about the
harm being done to me. And I did have the kind of conception where I
reconfirmed my knowledge of how I had perceived that no existing object has
any true existence.

Why is it so? Suppose, o Subhuti, that at that moment any
conception of a self had come into my mind. Then the thought
to harm someone would have come into my mind as well.
The conception of some sentient being, and the conception of
some living being, and the conception of person, would have
come into my mind. And because of that, the thought to harm
someone would have come into my mind as well.

Here is the reason why it is so. Suppose that at that moment any conception
of a self, where I thought of "me" as existing in an ultimate way, had come
into my mind. Or suppose any of the other conceptions mentioned had come
into my mind. Then the thought to harm someone would have come into my
mind as well; but the fact is that it did not.

Emptiness and Building Your Own Paradise

The Conqueror bespoke:
Suppose, o Subhuti, that some bodhisattva were to say, "I am
working to bring about paradises." This would not be spoken
true.

Lord Buddha wishes to indicate that, in order for a person to reach the
enlightenment described above, he or she must first bring about a paradise in
which to achieve the enlightenment. Therefore the Conqueror says to Subhuti,
Suppose some bodhisattva were to say or think to
himself--while holding a belief in true existence, and referring to
ultimate existence--"I am working to bring about paradises."
This statement would not be spoken true.

Why is it so? Because the Ones Thus Gone have stated that
these paradises, these "paradises," these lands that are put there
do not even exist. And this is why we call them "paradise."

PAS RDUL PHRA RAB KYI BAR BSHIG NA CI YANG MA YIN PA'I BAR 'GYUR TE MTSON TZAM MO,
Why is this the case? The reason is that the Ones Thus Gone have stated that
these perfect paradises, these places where you achieve your enlightenment,
are put there like an illusion; that is, they occur because a great many causes
and conditions have come together. But lands which have been put there in
an ultimate sense, say the Buddhas, do not even exist. Since though they do
exist to that state of mind which performs no check or analysis, we can
nominally call them "paradise."
This fact refers not only to the paradise of a Buddha, but also to each and
every thing which has ever been put here: to both the world where beings live
and the beings who live in the world. All of these are simply a label put on
the collection of a number of parts: they are all the same as a house, for
example. And all of these are such that, should you break them down
mentally all the way to their tiniest atoms, you would reach the point where
they are nothing at all. (This is the briefest sketch of the meaning for you.)

O Subhuti, it is thus: Suppose, for example, that someone's

as the king of all mountains, Mt. Sumeru. What do you think,
o Subhuti? Would that person's body be large?

And Subhuti replied,
O Conqueror, such a body would be large. O you who have
Gone to Bliss, such a body would be large. And why so?
Because Those Gone Thus have stated that it could never be a
thing at all. And this is why we call it a "body." Because
Those Gone Thus have stated that it could never be a thing at
all, we call it a "large body."

Lord Buddha wishes to show that the above applies not only to outer things
such as paradises, but also to the beings who inhabit this world: to objects such
as the body of a person. He wishes to show that they too exist only because
conditions have come together, and not in an ultimate way. Therefore he asks
Subhuti,
Suppose some person's body were to grow to the size of the
king of mountains, Mt. Sumeru. What do you think? Would
that body be something large?
And Subhuti respectfully replies,

Such a body would be large. Those who have Gone Thus
though have stated that this same body exists only as a term
applied to the heaps, to some collection of a great many parts.
It could never be a thing at all which existed in essence; that is,
it could never be something which did not depend on its parts,
say they. And this is why we can call such a body "large," in
the sense that words are used in the everyday world.
Here a large body is just a representative example; we are meant to apply this
reasoning to all physical objects, large or small. The entire statement here in
the sutra is aimed at showing us how to meditate upon the fact that each and
every detail of the world and the beings who inhabit it are all empty of any
natural existence.

And I tell you further, o Subhuti: any place where this sutra is
taught thereby becomes a place worthy of the offerings of the
entire world, with its gods, and men, and demigods. It
becomes a place which is worthy of their prostrations, and
worthy of their circumambulations. That place becomes
something like a stupa.

Here in a statement over and above the one before, Lord Buddha says,
O Subhuti, consider any son or daughter of noble family who
takes up this sutra, who holds it in their hands, and so on--any
living being who does these things and then puts the meaning of
the sutra into practice. It is entirely possible that such a person
could experience some pain, that they could suffer, and suffer
intensely, through various kinds of illness, or conflict with
others, or being criticized, or chained, or beaten, or anything of
the like. It could happen, but it would be no great problem,
because. . .

Why is it so? Because, o Subhuti, such beings are purifying
non-virtuous karma from the entire string of their previous
lives, karma that would have taken them to the three lower
realms. As they purify this karma, it causes them to suffer here
in this life. As such they will succeed in cleaning away the
karma of these non-virtuous deeds of their previous lifetimes,
and they will as well achieve the enlightenment of a Buddha.

For what reason is it so? Because such beings are purifying great non-
virtuous karma that they have committed both in this life and in their lifetimes
past--karma so serious that it would normally have taken them to the three
lower realms. As such, the results of all these deeds are ripening here in this
very life. Thus one is suffering pain, and by force of this suffering he or she
is "cleaning away"--that is, purifying--all of this non-virtuous karma. As
such, one will quickly achieve the enlightenment of a Buddha.

The force of an antidote action consisting of making great efforts in the
perfection of wisdom is destroying the grasping to some self-existence, the very
root of all non-virtuous deeds. This is why the text goes on to say that one
will achieve freedom and the state of omniscience. And since the text does say
this, then needless to say one could destroy the karma that is leading you to
a birth in the lower realms. The way in which this works is explained in texts
such as the Blaze of Reasoning and others. As the Sutra of the Great Liberation
says as well,
Even though one may have the bad karma
To take his birth in the three lower realms,
A simple headache will clean it away.
Suppose for example that a seed is planted, but is then deprived completely
of water, or fertilizer, or warmth, or the rest. Then it would never sprout.
Here the case is the same. If you are able to eliminate grasping to some self-
nature, then none of the karmas you have collected, regardless of how many
there are, can ever ripen forth. This is because their companion, the mental
afflictions, are absent. As the Commentary on Valid Perception states,
No further karmas can ever project their results
In one who has gone beyond the desire for existence;
This is because the conditions have all been finished.

O Subhuti, what do you think? Is there any dharma at all
which the Ones Thus Gone ever speak?
And Subhuti respectfully replied,
O Conqueror, none of the dharmas ever spoken by the Ones Thus
Gone even exist.

In the part before this one, Lord Buddha mentioned "the perfection of wisdom
spoken by the Ones Thus Gone," and explained how it could be the perfection
of wisdom. Someone might think to themselves, "Are there though any other
dharmas which were spoken by the Ones Thus Gone, and which do exist in an
ultimate sense?"
In order to answer this question with an emphatic "No!" the Buddha poses a
question to Subhuti: "Is there any such dharma at all?"
In reply, Subhuti offers up the following answer: "None of the dharmas ever
spoken by the Ones Thus Gone even exist, at least in an ultimate sense." The
point here is very similar to the one before, where it said that the teaching of
the dharma by the Ones Thus Gone did not even exist.

The Middle Way: Avoiding the Two Extremes
The following selections are from the 18th Chapter of the Commentary on the
Three Principal Paths, written by Pabongka Rinpoche (1878-1941).

THAL 'GYUR BA'I LUGS LA CHOS GANG DANG GANG YIN KYANG SNANG BA TZAM LAS BDEN PAR MA GRUB PAS DON DAM DU YOD PA'I YOD MTHA' DANG , SNANG BA TZAM DE RANG GI NGOS NAS MA GRUB PA LA BRTEN NAS STONG PAS THA SNYAD DU MED PA'I MED MTHA' SEL BA YIN,
The position of the Implication group though is that no particular object you
can choose has any true existence, aside from merely appearing this way; and
understanding this prevents you from going to the extreme of thinking things
exist--that is, exist in an ultimate way. And because this mere appearance itself
cannot exist on its own, an understanding of emptiness prevents your falling
into the extreme of thinking things do not exist--that is, do not exist in a
conventional way.

RTEN 'BREL YIN PHYIN CHAD RANG BZHIN GYIS MA GRUB PA'AM RANG TSUGS MA THUB PA LAS GZHAN DU 'GRO SA MED DE, GDAGS GZHI'I TSOGS PA LA BRTEN NAS 'BYUNG DGOS PA'I PHYIR, DPER NA, MI RGAN 'KHOG GIS RANG KHER LANGS MA THUB PAR GZHAN LA BRTEN NAS LDANG DGOS PA NI RANG GIS TSUGS MA THUB PA YIN PA LTAR RKYEN GZHAN ZHIG LA BRTEN DGOS TSAD RANG BZHIN GYIS TSUGS MA THUB PA YIN,
Once something is dependent there is no possibility for it to be anything else
but something which does not exist naturally--something which cannot stand
on its own. This is because it must then occur in dependence on the collection
of parts which serve as the basis that receives our label. Look at the example
of some feeble old man, unable to rise from his chair by himself, who must
seek some other support to get up--he cannot stand on his own. Here it's a
similar case: no object can stand on its own, no object can exist just naturally,
so long as it must depend on any other factor.
22
The Fourfold Teaching of the Middle Way

MKHAS PA DBU MA PAS NI RANG BZHIN GYIS MED KYANG GTAN NAS MED PA MA YIN PA DANG , THA SNYAD TZAM DU YOD KYANG RANG BZHIN GYIS YOD PA MA YIN PA'I DBYE BA BZHIR PHYE, DNGOS SMRA BA SOGS KYI 'KHRUL GZHI YOD MED BZHI PO 'DI MA PHYED PA'I SKYON YIN,
The real sages of the Middle Way school make a fourfold distinction: they say
that nothing exists naturally, but not that nothing exists at all; everything exists
merely by convention, but everything exists without existing naturally. The
point of error for the Functionalists and those other schools is their failure to
distinguish between these four: two kinds of "nothing exists" and two kinds of
"everything exists."

So we've shown that no object in the universe exists truly; we've given
"because it's dependent" as our reason for saying so; and we've demonstrated
that these two facts can prevent one from falling into either extreme. This too
is why we see statements like the following, from Root Wisdom:
Everything is right for any thing
For which the state of emptiness is right.
Or the well-known sutra lines:
Form is emptiness,
Emptiness form.

These last lines by the way are stated to show that dependence is itself empty,
and emptiness itself dependent. It helps your understanding of this point if
you take the same pattern and read it as

In short, concluded our Lama, the laws of cause and effect are all totally
proper for any entity which is empty of any natural existence. If you can just
keep yourself from falling into the two extremes, you will make no great other
blunders in your effort to develop correct view.

How Empty Things Still Work
We return now to the Diamond Cutter and its commentary:

,DE DE BZHIN TE, MDO 'DI BSHAD PA 'DI LA GANG DAG MI SKRAG MI DNGANG ZHING DNGANG BAR MI 'GYUR BA'I SEMS CAN DE DAG NI, NGO MTSAR RAB DANG LDAN PAR 'GYUR RO,
It is thus. Any living beings who receive an explanation of this
sutra and who are not made afraid, and are not frightened, and
who do not become frightened, are truly wondrous.

Here is the reason. In future days, certain living beings will receive, they will
listen to, an explanation of the meaning of the words of this sutra. And yet
they will not be made afraid, and they will not be frightened, and they will
not become extremely frightened, by any such thought as: "If this is so, and
if nothing at all exists in a true way, then all the ways in which things like
karma and its consequences work cannot be right, and so really nothing at all
can work."
Rather they will find a greater belief, an even greater faith, in all these objects.
And beings like this will be truly wondrous.
If things did exist in a true way, then it would be improper to say that they
ever changed. And then it would be improper, it would never be right, to
describe all the workings of things like karma and its consequences.
The way in which all things work, and nirvana itself, and everything else are
all quite proper. And none of these objects has any true existence, none of
them has any nature of their own. How all this can be is described by Lord
Tsongkapa in his Praise from Dependence:
Reaching the state of nirvana could never occur,
And elaborations too could never be stopped,
If objects had any nature of their own, because
A nature could not be stopped, You stated.
He also says,
Since things are empty of any nature
And the way things work is right,
There is no contradiction between them.
Those who see things the opposite
Think nothing can work with emptiness...

The Final Words of Emptiness and Impermanence

,SKAR MA RAB RIB MAR ME DANG ,
,SGYU MA ZIL BA CHU BUR DANG ,
,RMI LAM GLOG DANG SPRIN LTA BU,
,'DUS BYAS DE LTAR BLTA BAR BYA,
See anything
Brought about by causes
As like a star,
An obstruction of the eye,
A lamp, an illusion,
The dew, or a bubble;
A dream, or lightning,
Or else a cloud.

,DE NAS 'DUS BYAS KYI CHOS RNAMS RANG BZHIN MED CING MI RTAG PAR BSTAN NAS MJUG BSDU BA NI, SKAR MA RAB RIB MAR ME DANG , , ZHES GSUNGS TE, GZUGS LA SOGS PA'I PHUNG PO LNGA SOGS LA MTSON NA, DPE JI LTAR NA,
Next comes a concluding summary, which shows how all things brought
about by causes are empty of any nature of their own, and are also
impermanent. All this is contained in the verse about the "star, an obstruction
of the eye, a lamp," and the rest.
We could take for example the five heaps--physical form and the rest--or any
such objects. All these can be described in the following metaphors.

SKAR MA RNAMS NI MTSAN MOR SNANG ZHING , NYIN MOR MI SNANG BA DE BZHIN DU PHUNG SOGS KYI 'DUS BYAS RNAMS NI MA RIG PA'I MUN PA YOD NA DON DAM PAR STONG GI, BDEN MED RTOGS PA'I YE SHES KYI NYI MA SHAR BA NA DON DAM PAR MI SNANG BAS SKAR MA BZHIN DU BLTA'O,
Stars appear at night, and then by day they no longer appear. The parts to a
person and other things brought about by causes are just the same. If a
person's mind is full of the darkness of ignorance, then they appear to exist in
an ultimate sense. [Correcting an error in Tibetan text, stong for snang.]
Suppose though that the sun rises--the sun of the wisdom which perceives
that nothing exists truly. Then these objects no longer appear in an ultimate
sense. As such we should see these things as being like a star.

,RDUL SOGS RAB RIB KYIS MIG BSGRIBS PA'I TSE DON JI LTA BA BZHIN DU MI SNANG BAR GZHAN DU MTHONG BA LTAR MA RIG PA'I RAB RIB KYIS BLO MIG BSGRIBS PA'I NGOR 'DUS BYAS RNAMS KYANG DON GZHAN DU SNANG NGO ,
Suppose your eyes are blocked by some obstruction in them--by particles of
dust or something of the like. The thing that you're trying to look at then
doesn't look the way it really is; rather, you see it some other way. It's just the
same with the eye of the mind when it's blocked by the obstruction of
ignorance. Things brought about by causes then appear to this mind as
something other than what they are.

,MAR ME NI SNGO 'BU LA BRTEN NAS MYUR DU SKYE ZHING 'JIG PA DE BZHIN DU 'DUS BYAS RNAMS NI RANG RANG GI RGYU RKYEN LA BRTEN NAS MYUR DU SKYE 'JIG BYED DO,
The flame of a butter lamp, supported by a thin plant wick, flares and then
quickly dies out. Caused things, each supported their various causes and
conditions, also go through a continuous process of rising and quickly dying
out.

,SGYU MA NI DON GZHAN DU SNANG BA LTAR 'DUS BYAS RNAMS NI BLO 'KHRUL BA'I NGOR BDEN PAR SNANG NGO ,
An illusion is something that looks different than what is actually there.
Things brought about by causes also appear to exist truly, to a mistaken state
of mind.

,ZIL MA NI MYUR DU 'JIG PA LTAR 'DUS BYAS RNAMS NI RANG GI DUS GNYIS PAR MI SDOD PAR MYUR DU 'JIG GO,
Dew vanishes quickly; things with causes are the same--they die away
speedily, without lasting even into the second instant of their existence.

,CHU BUR NI CHU 'KHRUGS PA SOGS LAS GLO BUR DU 'BYUNG ZHING 'JIG PA LTAR 'DUS BYAS RNAMS NI RKYEN TSOGS NA GLO BUR DU 'BYUNG ZHING 'JIG GO,
Bubbles pop up at random, because some water is stirred up or something of
the like, and then they burst and disappear just as suddenly. Caused things
work the same way: when the various conditions all come together, they pop
up suddenly, and then they die out just as suddenly.

,RMI LAM NI GNYID KYIS BSLAD PA'I TSE 'KHRUL SNANG YIN PA LTAR 'DUS BYAS RNAMS NI MA RIG PAS BSLAD PA'I NGOR BDEN SNANG DU 'CHAR RO,
Dreams are an example of a misperception, which is due to the affects of sleep
on the mind. Things brought about by causes as well are misapprehended,
they seem to exist truly, to the mind which is affected by ignorance.

,GLOG NI MYUR DU 'BYUNG ZHING 'JIG PA LTAR 'DUS BYAS RNAMS NI RKYEN TSOGS NA MYUR DU 'BYUNG ZHING 'JIG GO,
Lightning flashes and dies out quickly. Caused things too rise and die out
quickly, depending on the conditions that assemble to bring them about.

Clouds are something that gather and fade in the sky, depending on the
wishes of the serpent-beings and such. Things brought about by causes are the
same; depending on the influence of karma which is either communal or not,
they rise or die out.
Each of the metaphors above is also meant to represent how no object brought
about by causes has any true existence.

To put it briefly, Lord Buddha is telling us that we should "See that each and
every thing brought about by causes is impermanent, and is empty of any
nature of its own, all just like the nine examples given above." We should also
consider these lines as indicating both the lack of self to the person, and the
lack of self to phenomena.

The second section in our explanation of the wish to achieve enlightenment for
every living being describes how to develop this wish. As the next two verses
say,
(7,8)
They're swept along on four fierce river currents,
Chained up tight in past deeds, hard to undo,
Stuffed in a steel cage of grasping "self,"
Smothered in the pitch-black ignorance.
In a limitless round they're born, and in their births
Are tortured by three sufferings without a break;
Think how your mothers feel, think of what's happening
To them: try to develop this highest wish.

We may begin with another pair of verses, from The Bodhisattva's Life:

Even just wishing you could stop
A headache another person has
Can bring you merit without measure
Because of the helpful intent you feel.
What need then to mention the wish
That you could stop the immeasurable pain
Of every being, and put every one
In a state of measureless happiness?

And then spill over farther still.

The next step is the meditation where you recognize that every living being is
your mother. Gaining this recognition is much easier if you apply the line of
reasoning mentioned in the Commentary on Valid Perception for demonstrating
the infinite regression of one's awareness. We'll present this reasoning here,
in brief.

RANG GI DE RING GI RIG PA 'DI KHA SANG GI RIG PA'I RIG RGYUN DANG , DA LO'I RIG PA 'DI LO SNGA MA'I RIG PA'I RIG RGYUN YIN PA BZHIN DU, RANG GI TSE 'DI'I RIG PA 'DI TSE SNGA MA'I RIG PA'I RIG RGYUN DANG , TSE SNGA MA'I RIG PA DE YANG DE'I TSE SNGA MA SNGA MA'I RIG RGYUN YIN PAS DE GA NANG BZHIN PHAR DED NA 'DI PHAN CHAD DU MED BYA BA GTAN NAS MED PAR RIG PA'I YA MTHA' THUG MED DU 'GRUB CING ,
Your awareness of today is a mental continuation of the awareness you had
yesterday. This year's awareness is a mental continuation of the awareness
you had the year before. Just so, your awareness over this entire life is a
mental continuation of the awareness you had in your former life. The
awareness you had in your former life was, in turn, a mental continuation of
the awareness you had in the life before that. You can continue back in a
regression like this and absolutely never reach some point where you can say,
"Prior to this, I had no awareness." This then proves the infinite regression of
one's awareness.

My own circle of life then must also be beginningless, and the births I have
taken as well can have no starting point. There exists no place where I have
never taken birth. I have taken birth in every single place, countless times.
There exists no creature whose body I have not worn. I have worn every kind
of body, countless times. Just the lives I have taken as a dog are themselves
beyond any number to count. And the same is true for every living being.

Therefore there exists no being who has never been my mother. Absolutely
every single one of them has been my mother a countless number of times.
Even the number of times that each has been my mother in just my births as
a human is past all counting too.

Do this meditation over and over until you gain a deep-felt certainty that each

Developing a sense of gratitude is the next step, and you can start by taking
your mother in this present life. She began her hardships for me while I was
still in her womb, gladly taking it upon herself to avoid anything she felt might
hurt me--even down to the food she ate--treating herself with care, as though
she were sick. For nine months and ten days she carried me in her womb,
looking at her own body as though it belonged to someone else, someone very
ill, and hesitating even to take big steps.

As she gave me birth, my mother was torn with violent suffering, excruciating
pain, and yet still felt an overwhelming joy, as though she had discovered
some precious gem that would grant her any wish.

Right then I knew absolutely nothing more than to cry and wave my arms
around somehow. I was totally helpless. Totally stupid. Incapacitated.
Nothing more than some baby chick with a red-rubber beak still yet to harden.
But she swayed me on her fingertips, and pressed me to her body's warmth,
and greeted me with a smile of love.

With joyful eyes she gazed on me, and wiped the snot from my face with her
lips, and cleaned my filthy shit with her hands. Sometimes she chewed my
food for me, and fed me things like milky porridge straight from her mouth
to mine. She did her best to protect me from any hurt. She did her best to get
me any good.

In those days I had to look to her for everything; good or bad, happy or sad,
all the hope I could have lay in one person: mother. But for her kindness, I
wouldn't have lasted an hour; they could have set me out in the open right
then and some birds or a dog would have come and made a meal of me--I'd
have no hope of coming out alive. Every single day she protected me from
harms that could have taken my life, no less than a hundred times. Such was
her kindness.

And while I was growing up she gathered together whatever I needed,
avoiding no bad deed, and no suffering, and caring nothing for what other
people might say of her. All the money and things she had she handed over
to me, hesitating to use anything for herself.

Paying Back Your Mother's Kindness

Look now, concluded our Lama, at the way any common animal--a dog or
bird, even the tiny sparrow--shows affection for its young, and cares for it
well. From watching this we can imagine what kindness we were given too.

The next step in gaining the wish for enlightenment is to develop a wish to
repay this great kindness. So every living being is my mother, and has given
me her loving care over and over endlessly, for time with no beginning. And
we know from what was described above that they are being swept along by
four great currents, out to sea--to the vast expanse of the ocean of cyclic life.
They are tormented, without a break, by the three types of suffering, and all
the other pains. Their situation is desperate.

And here am I, their child. Right now I have a chance to rescue them from
this ocean of cyclic life. Suppose I simply sit and bide my time, and give no
thought to them. This is the lowest a person could stoop--base and absolutely
shameless.

Right now I could give them things that they would be happy to get--food, or
clothes, or beds to sleep on, whatever. But these are only some temporary
happiness within the circle of life. The very highest way of repaying their
kindness would be to put them into the state of ultimate happiness. So let me
decide within myself that every living being must come to have every
happiness. And every one should be freed as well from every form of pain.

Right now it's absurd to say that these beings have any kind of pure
happiness--they don't even have any of the impure kinds. Every single thing
they think is happiness is, in its essence, nothing more than pain. They want
wantables but don't want to know about doing the good deeds that bring
happiness. They want no unwantables but don't want to know about giving
up the bad deeds that bring pain. They act ass backwards: they do what they
shouldn't and don't what they should. And so my dear aged mothers, these
living beings, are made to suffer.
"How good it would be if they could all find every happiness,
and every cause of happiness.
I wish they could. I'll see that they do."
"How good it would be if they could all be free of every pain,
and every cause of pain.
I wish they could. I'll see that they do."

Let these two trains of thought run through your mind; meditate on them over
and over again. Then you will come to feel the very strongest loving-kindness
and compassion.

Taking Responsibility Yourself

Some people might come up with the idea that "Why should I take upon
myself this great load, of every living being? There are plenty of Buddhas and
bodhisattvas around to guide them on their way." This kind of thought though
is absolutely improper. It's base. It's shameless. It's as if your mother in this
life was hungry, and parched, and you expected someone else's child to go and
give her food and drink. But it's you for whom she has cared, and the
responsibility of paying her back has fallen only to you.

It's the same with all these living beings, who for beginningless time have
served as my mother so many times, and who in each of these times cared for
me in every way with the kindness of this present mother. Returning their
kindness is no business of anyone else at all, not for some Buddha or
bodhisattva--it is my responsibility, and only mine.

So someone is going to do it--to make sure every sentient being has every
happiness, and never a single pain. It is going to be myself; I'll rely on no one
else. I by myself will see to it that every single being comes to have every
single happiness. And I by myself will see to it that every single being gets
free of every single pain. I will by myself put them into the state of the Lama,
the state of Buddhahood. Meditate strongly on these thoughts; they are the
step we call the "extraordinary form of personal responsibility."

I may be able to develop this noble intention, but the fact is that I'm
completely incapable of leading a single being to Buddhahood--much less
every one of them. Who then has the capacity? This power is had by a fully
enlightened Buddha--only by him, and by no one else at all. If I can reach the
same state, I will by definition have brought both mine and others' benefit to
its perfection. And then every single ray of light that emanates from me,

whether it be an action of my body, or my speech, or my thoughts, will have
the power to accomplish the ends of countless sentient beings.

And so, for the sake of every living being, I will do anything I can to achieve
this one great goal--the state of a Buddha--with every speed. Think this way
to yourself, and do anything you can to develop the genuine wish to reach
enlightenment for every living being.

While you practice these meditations to develop the wish for enlightenment,
you can also reflect that--when you achieve Buddhahood--you will by the
way automatically gain everything you need for yourself as well. Our Lama
mentioned that this point was stated in Lord Tsongkapa's exposition on the
Steps of the path as being very helpful in preventing a person from slipping
to the lesser way.

Nowadays when you go up to someone and ask him what his very most
important practice is, he'll tell you he's meditating on one of those powerful
tutelary deities. You don't meet people who say their chief practice is
meditating on the wish to achieve enlightenment for every living being. Much
less, for in fact it's quite difficult to find anyone who even realizes that he
should make this wish his centermost practice.

Why Those Who Follow Tantra Must Keep the Lower Vows Too
The following selection is taken from the Highway for Bodhisattvas.

Therefore the idea that those who are keeping the higher vows must give up
the lower vows is much like a fierce rain of hail, which descends to destroy the
very root of the teachings of the victorious Buddhas, and chops down the rich
crops of all the goodness and happiness that could come to every living
creature. It is the totally blind idea of a person who has absolutely no
understanding of the essential points of the important scriptures of the entire
range of Buddhist schools. As such you must carry this idea far away from
you, and throw it out like rubbish.

How to Take the Bodhisattva Vows
The first selection is from the String of Shining Jewels, by Geshe Tsewang Samdrup
(c. 1835), ff. 16A-16B.

Here first is how those who have not yet been granted the vows of the
bodhisattva may receive them. Begin by prostrating yourself in reverence to
the Buddhas, and to their sons and daughters. Make offerings to them to the
fullest of your ability. Then, for the sake of all living beings, make a fervent
appeal to the one from whom you will take the vows: to your Lama, to one
who is keeping these vows well, and who is a master of the scriptures of the
bodhisattva way, and who has the ability to bring up his student. Take thus
the vows upon yourself.

Master Nagarjuna composed a text for a ceremony to formally raise the wish
for enlightenment within one's mind, but did not compose any separate text
for a ceremony to take on the vows. The following lines though do occur in
his ritual for raising the wish:
Recite the following three times, in order to raise within your own
mind the Wish for Enlightenment:
I swear to gain the ultimate
Wish for Buddhahood,
And take all living kind in my care;
I swear I will sweetly do
All those highest deeds
That Bodhisattvas do.
For the sake of all, let me be the Buddha.

"What kind of person," you may ask, "must you be to take the vows?" The
bodhisattva can be either a layperson or someone who is ordained. They must
feel a wish from the bottom of their hearts to practice the training for
bodhisattvas that we have described above; that is, the three kinds of morality.
They must also have raised up in their hearts the prayer of the wish for
enlightenment--they must have made the prayer to achieve total Buddhahood
in the proper way, following the instructions.

,SDOM PA BZUNG BA TZAM BYED KYI BYANG SEMS KYI BSLAB PA LA SLOB 'DOD MED PA DANG SMON SEMS MA BSKYED PA LA NI SDOM PA SBYIN PAR MI BYA'O,
One should not grant the vows to someone who is only taking the vows, but
who has no interest in practicing the training for bodhisattvas; neither should
one give these vows to someone who has not yet felt the wish in the form of
a prayer in their hearts.

If there is a person who does have the right intention to take the vows, there
is something you should do then first before you grant them, for it will make
their vows more firm. This is to inform the candidate thoroughly of the
various points in which a bodhisattva must train himself or herself, and of the
various mistakes they must avoid, as described in the great mother work
within the body of bodhisattva literature: this very Bodhisattva Levels.

The reason for explaining all this to the candidate is so that he or she can look
into his or her own heart and see whether or not they will be able to keep the
vows; it is so they can analyze the situation intelligently, and then take the
vows, and do so with joy. The point is not to somehow force the person into
accepting the vows against their will. It is important as well that the person
not see themselves as trying to keep up with what others are doing and take
the vows for this reason. Understand that if you give the vows thus properly,
and with the proper ritual, they will be strong; be certain to do everything with
your eyes open.

In this sense the bodhisattva vows are unlike the freedom vows; before you
take them, you must go for teachings on them and understand them
thoroughly. With this your intentions to keep the vows carefully will be
strengthened, and then you are ready to take them. It is said that if you do
have these intentions the vows will form within you as you take them, and
that they will not form if you do not.

Who Can Give the Bodhisattva Vows

Here secondly are the details of the person from who you receive the vows.
"And what kind of person is it," you may ask, "from whom we must take the
bodhisattva vows?" The person should be one who has made the bodhisattva
prayer; that is, who has raised within himself the wish in the form of a prayer.
He or she must also be someone who is "acting consistently," which means that
they are keeping the vows of the bodhisattva well. They should be a master
of the teachings of the greater way, and should be able to memorize the words
of the ceremony and communicate them clearly in speech to the person taking
the vows, and so on. Finally they must be able to hear and comprehend the
responses of the candidate.

"What kind of person," one may continue, "should we not take our bodhisattva
vows from?" Bodhisattvas should not accept the bodhisattva vows from just
any bodhisattva that there is, even if they seem very learned; rather they
should avoid those whose intentions or practice have degenerated. The
person's intentions have degenerated if they have lost their faith, which means
on a gross level that they no longer wish to keep the vows, and on a medium
level that they no longer practice them, and on a more subtle level that they
are no longer "thinking," which means making good efforts in their vows. The
practice has degenerated when the person's attempts to follow the six
perfections have failed.

The 18 Root Bodhisattva Vows
The following selection is taken from the String of Shining Jewels, by Geshe Tsewang
Samdrup (c. 1835).

Next we describe ways for those who have received the bodhisattva vows to
keep them, and prevent their decline. You must first submit yourself, in the
proper way, to a holy spiritual guide, one who is learned in the scriptures of
the bodhisattva way, and in the commentaries which explain the true intent of
these scriptures. Then you must educate yourself in all the various bodhisattva
precepts. You should especially learn the eighteen root downfalls, the forty-six
secondary offenses, and so on.

`, DANG PO RTZA LTUNG BCO BRGYAD NI,
The eighteen root downfalls
We begin then with the eighteen root downfalls:

RNYED PA DANG BKUR STI LA CHAGS NAS RANG LA BSTOD CING , GZHAN YON TAN CAN LA SMAD NA BDAG BSTOD GZHAN SMOD KYI RTZA LTUNG ,
(1) The root downfall of praising yourself, and criticizing others.
You commit this when, out of attachment to gain or honor, you praise yourself,
and criticize others who in actuality possess good qualities. This can be
divided into two separate root downfalls, those of praising oneself and of
criticizing others.

(2) The root downfall of failing to give Dharma or material assistance
You commit this in a situation where you should be giving the Dharma that
you know, or the material things that you own, to those who are suffering, to
those who have no protector. Instead though you fail to give them these
things, due to feelings of possessiveness. This can be divided into the two root
downfalls of failing to give the Dharma and of failing to give material
assistance.

(3) The root downfall of failing to accept someone's apology, and striking another
You commit this when someone comes to you in the appropriate manner and
explains themselves in some way, such as asking your forgiveness or the like.
Instead though you remain angry and commit various kinds of harm towards
them physically or verbally. This can be divided into the two root downfalls
of striking another and of not accepting a person's explanation of themselves.

(4) The root downfall of giving up the greater way, and teaching false dharma
You commit this when you give up the scriptures of the bodhisattva way,
saying: "These were not spoken by the Buddha." Then you take pleasure in
some false dharma yourself, and teach it to others as well. This can be divided
into the two root downfalls of giving up the greater way and of teaching false
dharma.

(5) The root downfall of stealing what belongs to the Jewels
You commit this in the following way. There is some material wealth or object
which has been dedicated to the Three Jewels. Although you have no right to
do so, you intentionally take the thing for yourself. You do so either by
yourself or by having someone else do it for you, and by any of the various
ways: thieving in stealth, robbing by force, or taking away through some clever
means. The downfall is complete when you obtain the thing. This can be
divided into three different root downfalls, one each for stealing what belongs
to each one of the three different Jewels.

(6) The root downfall of giving up the highest Dharma
You commit this when you discount the scriptural collections of the three
ways, which present each and every aspect of the path, by saying "This is not
the word of the Buddha." This can be divided into three different root
downfalls, one each for giving up the respective scriptural collections of each
of the three ways.

(7) The root downfall of taking away the golden robes, and the rest, and removing
someone from the status of an ordained person
You commit this when you take an ordained person, whether they be one who
is maintaining their morality or not, and take away their golden robes, or beat
them, or incarcerate them; or else remove them from the status of being
ordained. This can be divided into the two root downfalls of taking away a
person's golden robes or the rest, and of removing a person from the status of
an ordained person.

(8) The root downfall of committing an immediate misdeed
You commit this when you commit any one or combination of the following:
killing your father, killing your mother, killing an enemy destroyer, creating
a schism in the Sangha, or drawing blood from One Thus Gone with evil
intent. This can be divided into five separate root downfalls, corresponding
to each of the five immediate misdeeds.

You commit this when you hold to ideas such as "There is no relation between
the deeds we commit and the consequences we experience," or "There are no
past or future lives," or anything of the like.

(10) The root downfall of destroying towns and such
You commit this when you destroy towns, or cities, or whole areas, or entire
countries. This can be divided into the four different root downfalls of
destroying towns, and then each of the rest.

(11) The root downfall of teaching emptiness to a person who is not yet mentally
prepared
You commit this with a person who has not yet reached a level where he or
she can absorb the teachings on emptiness, and yet who has been able to
develop the wish to achieve total enlightenment. The downfall is completed
when, as a result of your teaching them emptiness, they become frightened--in
such a way that they turn back from their wish to achieve full enlightenment,
and develop instead a wish to achieve the goals of the lower way.

(12) The root downfall of causing a person to turn back from total enlightenment
Committing this begins when you say the following to a person who has
already developed the wish to achieve total enlightenment:

You will never be able to carry out the six perfections, and
actually reach Buddhahood. If you strive instead for the goals of
the listeners and self-made Buddhas, then you will manage to
liberate yourself from the circle of suffering life."
When because of your talking this way the person turns back from his or her
wish to achieve full enlightenment, the downfall is complete.

(13) The root downfall of causing a person to give up the morality of freedom
You commit this with a person who is keeping properly the morality of
individual freedom. You say to him or her, "What's the use of keeping the
morality of freedom pure? You should rather develop the wish to achieve full
enlightenment--you should come over to the greater way." And then you say,
"If you do so, you'll be able to stop each and every bad deed committed
through any of the three doors of expression."
When because of your talking this way the person turns away from the
morality of individual freedom, the root downfall is completed.

(14) The root downfall of holding that a person cannot eliminate desire and the rest
by following the way of the learner
You commit this when you hold that the realizations of listeners and self-made
Buddhas could never liberate a person from the circle of suffering life: you
discount the lesser way, saying "Regardless of how much a person might train
himself in the ways of the listeners and the self-made Buddhas, he could never
thereby eliminate the mental afflictions in their entirety."

The root downfall of criticizing someone else due to one's desire for the adulation of
others
With this root downfall you are reciting teachings of the greater way, or
reading them, presenting them to others, or anything of the like, all out of an
attachment to material gain or the respect of others. At the same time though
you claim, "I am a practitioner of the greater way who has no concern for
material gain, the respect of others, or any such thing. That other person
though is not this way at all." The downfall is complete when you have
expressed the praise on one hand, and the criticism on the other.
It is stated that, since this root downfall is subsumed by the first
downfall--that of praising oneself and criticizing others--it should not be
counted as a separate downfall.

(15) The root downfall of professing the complete opposite
You commit this as follows. In actuality, you have yet to perceive emptiness
directly. Nonetheless you teach the subject of emptiness to others and say,
"Meditate as I have taught you, and you will come to see emptiness; then you'll
be just like me." The downfall is completed as soon as the other person grasps
the meaning of your words.

(16) The root downfall of accepting what belongs to the Jewels when someone presents
it to you
Suppose a king and his minister or any such official is exacting some
punishment, and has taken an object that belongs to the Jewels, or to the
Sangha, or to an individual monk. And suppose that they offer it to you. You
commit this downfall when you accept the thing, and come into possession of
it.

(17) The root downfall of rejecting the practice of quietude, and giving the possessions
of meditators to those whose practice is recitation
You commit this as follows. Out of feelings of dislike for them, you take away
the possessions of meditators who are average people engaged in balanced
meditation on quietude. Then you give these possessions to persons whose
practice is recitation.

BYANG CHUB KYI SEMS GTONG NA, BYANG CHUB SEMS 'DOR GYI RTZA LTUNG 1A8,

You commit this if you ever give up the wish for enlightenment.

of the "binding" mental afflictions or "chains" to be present in order for a root
downfall to occur.

With the other sixteen root downfalls though there must be what we call a
"major" instance of the chains. For an instance of the chains to be "major," all
four must be present. These four chains are as follows:
(1) A desire to commit still more of the particular wrong deed;
(2) A lack of any shame or consideration;

(3) A sense of enjoyment, and satisfaction; as well as
(4) Failing to consider one's deed as something wrong.

If one possesses the fourth mental affliction, and on top of it the first three as
well, then this is a "major" instance of the chains. There are other cases where
one possesses the fourth affliction and in addition to it only two of the first
three, or else only one of these three, or perhaps no more than the fourth on
its own. All these cases are said to represent a "medium" impurity. The first
three are said to be a "lesser" impurity.

A person can be engaged in a basic form of one of the sixteen root downfalls
and yet, should the requirement of a "major" instance of the chains not be
filled, he or she is only committing a kind of downfall subsumed by a lesser
or medium level of impurity. Such a person then would only be performing
a secondary offense categorized in the collection of root downfalls.

How to Restore the Bodhisattva Vows

KUN DKRIS CHEN PO TSANG BA'I RTZA LTUNG NGAM, SMON SEMS GTONG BA, LOG LTA BYUNG BA LTA BU LA SDOM PA SLAR BSLANG DGOS SHING ,
This brings us to the third part in our presentation on the vows of the
bodhisattva, which concerns how to restore them, should they happen to
decline. Any time you commit one of the root downfalls and a "major"
instance of the chains has occurred, or else when something happens like
giving up the prayer for the wish for enlightenment or developing wrong
views, you must take the vows over again.

Whenever you commit offenses that involve a medium level of impurity, you
should confess them before a group of three or more persons. Whenever you
commit offenses involving a lesser level of impurity, or else any of the forty-six
secondary offenses or anything of the like, then you should confess them
before a single person.

Any time you commit any other offenses, the best thing you can do is to
confess it before a single person, and so on. If you can't do that, then you
should confess before an altar with representations of the body, speech, and
mind of the Buddha, with a strong feeling that you are performing your
confession in the presence of the victorious Buddhas, along with their
bodhisattva sons and daughters.

SKYABS 'GRO SEMS BSKYED, LTUNG BSHAGS, SPYI BSHAGS, RDOR SEMS BSGOMS BZLAS SOGS KYI SGO NAS BSHAGS PAR YANG BYA'O, ,
You should also confess and purify yourself through the practices of going for
refuge and praying to develop the wish for enlightenment, performing a
confession of downfalls, a general confession, meditation and recitation on the
practice of the Warrior of Diamond, and so on.

BSHAGS PA SNGA PHYI 'DI RNAMS KYI TSE GNYEN PO STOBS BZHI TSANG BA'I SGO NAS BSHAGS DGOS SHING   ,
Whenever you perform any of the confessions mentioned throughout here you
must do so with all four of the antidote forces complete. . .

What Happens if You Break a Root Bodhisattva Vow
The following selections are taken from the Highway for Bodhisattvas, by Je
Tsongkapa (1357-1419):

MDOR NA PHAM PA GCIG BYUNG NA YANG TSE DE LA SA DANG PO THOB PA MI SRID CING DE DANG NYE BA'I RGYU TSOGS RGYA CHEN PO SNGAR YOD 'PHEL BA DANG SNGAR MED SKYED PA'I SKAL BA MED NA PHAM PA YANG DANG YANG DU BYUNG NA LTA CI SMOS,
We may summarize these points as follows. If a person commits even one of
the "defeats" [root downfalls], it is impossible for him or her to attain the first
bodhisattva level within the same life. One also loses the spiritual fortune to
see the close cause of this attainment, the great collection of virtue necessary
to reach the first bodhisattva level, increase in its power (for whatever amount
one has already collected) or occur in the first place (for whatever amount one
has yet to collect). I need not mention then what happens when you commit
these defeats over and over again.

DE'I PHYIR PHAM PA BYUNG YANG BYANG SEMS KYI SDOM PA BLANG DU YOD PAS SNYAM DU MI BSAM PAR RTZA LTUNG GIS GTAN MA GOS PA LA SROG BSDOS BYA'O,
Therefore you must never think to yourself: "Well, even if I did commit one of
the defeats, it doesn't matter, I could take my bodhisattva vows over again."
Rather you must, at the cost of your very life, avoid ever being defiled by a
root downfall of the vows.
************

Again we can summarize as follows. Suppose you commit a root downfall,
but from the point just after you do so, and on, you do not lose your wish for
enlightenment in the form of a prayer. The power of this kind of wish then

prevents the fact that you have committed a root downfall from acting as a
block that would stop the vows from ever growing again in you. If you lack
this kind of wish though there would be nothing to block the power of the root
downfall, and this would make your vows something that you could not
restore. This is the point of the quotation.

Giving Up Your Bodhisattva Vows

Concerning this point, suppose someone gives back his or her bodhisattva
vows. He or she has first agreed to accomplish the help and happiness of an
infinite number of living beings, and then stopped keeping their vows
altogether. As a result they will fall to the lower births, and then be forced to
wander there for a very long time; for if one must pass to the lower realms for
destroying the happiness of even a single living creature, what need is there
to mention what happens when you destroy the happiness of a limitless
number of beings? For this and many other reasons is the point above proven.
************

The above reasons all relate to a case where one gives up the wish for
enlightenment in the form of a prayer; and even if one were not to give it up,
yet still gave up the great pledge of taking on oneself the deeds of a

bodhisattva, it would be nearly the same thing. Therefore it is totally wrong
to give back one's vows. Thus too one should consider everything very
carefully before one even takes on the vows, for it is very grave if one goes
wrong.

Here next we will explain the forty-six different secondary offenses against the
vows of a bodhisattva.
(1) The secondary offense of failing to make offering to the Jewels through the three
doors of expression
You commit this when a single period of 24 hours passes, and you have not
yet made offering to any one or combination of the Three Jewels by means of
the three doors of expression; that is, through bowing down with your body,
and praising with your words, and admiring with your thoughts.

(2) The secondary offense of allowing thoughts of desire to go on
You commit this when you fail to try to stop a thought that comes up in
yourself such as an inordinate desire for an object, or not being satisfied with
what you have, an attachment to having others pay you honor, or anything of
the like.

(3) The secondary offense of failing to pay respect to one's elders
You commit this with a person who is your elder in the sense of having taken
the precepts of the bodhisattva before you, and who has good qualities, and
is worthy of your honor. The offense is done when you fail to pay them
respect by honoring them in some way, or the like.

You commit this when someone invites you to partake of a meal, accept some
article of clothing, or anything of the like, but out of pride, or a wish to hurt
them, anger, or laziness, you refuse to come.

laziness, you refuse to accept gold or silver or any other kind of material
wealth that a sponsor has tried to offer to you.

or laziness--you fail to give the Dharma to those who wish it.

(8) The secondary offense of rejecting persons with sullied morality
Suppose you encounter persons with sullied morality: those who have
committed one of the immediate misdeeds, or one of the root downfalls. You
commit this offense when, because of what they have done, and with feelings
of wanting to hurt them, or out of anger or laziness, you reject and ignore
them completely.

(9) The secondary offense of failing to follow the rules, which leads other persons to
develop faith
You commit this when you fail to follow the rules of the teachings on
discipline, just as though you were someone who belonged to the tradition of
the listeners, for this is something that protects the minds of others.

(10) The secondary offense of performing deeds which are only of lesser benefit for all
living beings
A bodhisattva need not necessarily observe certain kinds of proscribed morality
from the teachings on discipline in the same way that a person of the listener
tradition would. An example would be the downfalls which are exclusively
proscribed, such as the one in the "abandonment" group, where a monk has
kept cloth for over ten days. If it is not incumbent on you to do so and yet
still you observe this vow in exactly the same way that someone of the listener
tradition would, then you have committed this offense.

(11) The secondary offense of failing to break a rule out of compassion
There are certain extraordinary situations where specific misdeeds--the seven
of taking life and the rest--are allowed for a person who possesses the wish
for enlightenment, and who is practicing the precepts of the bodhisattva in the
proper way. If you are this kind of person and it would be of extraordinary
benefit to others if you did commit such a deed, then you have committed this
offense when you fail to do so.

of wrong livelihood, and fail to take some corrective measure. These five are

trying to obtain things through pretending, flattering, hinting, forcing, or
baiting.

to get others to act wild and so on.

of suffering life
You commit this when you think to yourself, and also say to others, the
following: "Bodhisattvas don't like to reach nirvana; in fact, they work for the
opposite. They have no fear of the mental afflictions, and they do not try to
keep their minds totally away from these thoughts. They only want to achieve
Buddhahood, and they wander around in the circle of suffering life for three
'countless' eons."

Suppose you have said or done something that has led to some vile rumors or
slanderous talk which might cause people to doubt the veracity or purity of
what you say. You commit this offense when you fail to take steps to clarify
the situation and stop the rumors.

(16) The secondary offense of failing to correct someone when it must be done in a
negative way
Suppose another person is committing bad deeds in their actions or speech,
and you realize that if you took some very forceful action towards them you
would be able to set them straight. You commit this offense when, for no
more reason than to have them maintain their good opinion of you, you fail
then to take this step.

particular part of the scriptural collection of the bodhisattvas: "This part is not
as good," or "The composition at this point is inferior," or "The author of this

beings."

Rather you dismiss them completely, or criticize them behind their backs, and
focus on whether the way they express themselves is beautiful or not, instead
of focussing on the meaning.

The Secondary Offenses Against the Wish for Enlightenment
The following are the secondary offenses against the precepts of the prayer for the wish
for enlightenment:

`GZHAN YANG SMON SEMS KYI BSLAB BYA DANG 'GAL BA'I NYES BYAS LA, GZHAN LA CHOS DANG ZANG ZING GIS SKYONG 'OS PA LA MI SKYONG BA DANG , GZHAN GYI GNOD PA LA 'KHON DU 'DZIN CING RIS SU BCAD NAS CHAGS SDANG BYED PA DANG ,
Here we will list additional offenses, which are committed against the precepts
of the prayer for the wish for enlightenment. One would be failing to support
those whom it would be proper to support, either with Dharma or with
material things. Another would be failing to let go of your anger about
something someone else had done to hurt you, or else discriminating between
people, in the sense of liking some and disliking others.

There is also failing to take yourself to a holy lama, and giving up the practices
of learning and contemplation upon what you have learned. Another is failing
to have helping others in mind as you partake of food or clothing or any other
thing you make use of. A final example would be to engage in any virtuous
activity without having in mind the wish to reach enlightenment for the sake
of all living beings. All these are spoken to be secondary offenses against the
prayer.
The four black deeds, and the four white deeds

`SKYE BA GZHAN DU YANG BYANG CHUB KYI SEMS DANG MI 'BRAL BA'I RGYU, NAG CHOS BZHI SPONG ZHING , DKAR CHOS BZHI BLANG BAR BYA DGOS PAS DE'I TSUL NI,
There are certain causes that will, further, prevent you from losing the wish for
enlightenment in your other lives. For these you will have to give up the four
black deeds, and then take up the four white deeds. Here is how to do so.

NAG CHOS DANG PO BLA MA DANG MCHOD GNAS SOGS LA DER SHES BZHIN DU RDZUN GYIS DBU BSKOR BA, DE'I GNYEN POR DKAR CHOS DANG PO SEMS CAN KUN LA BZHAD GAD TZAM GYI PHYIR YANG SHES BZHIN DU RDZUN MI SMRA BA,
The first black deed is to intentionally deceive your Lama, or those to whom
we make offerings, or any such person, by lying to them. The antidote for
doing this is the first of the white deeds, which is never intentionally speaking
a lie, even if only in jest, to any single living being there is.

NAG CHOS GNYIS PA GZHAN GYI DGE BA BYED PA LA 'GYOD PA BSKYED DU GZHUG PA, DE'I GNYEN POR DKAR CHOS BZHI PA RANG GIS SMIN PAR BYAS PA'I SEMS CAN THEG DMAN GYI THEG PA LA MI 'GOD PAR RDZOGS PA'I BYANG CHUB 'DZIN DU GZHUG PA,
The second black deed is to cause another person to regret some virtuous thing
they have done. The antidote for doing this is the fourth white deed, which
is to bring a person that you are cultivating to strive for total enlightenment,
rather than bringing them to the path of the lower way.

NAG CHOS GSUM PA BYANG SEMS LA KHONG KHROS MI SNYAN PAR BRJOD PA, DE'I GNYEN POR DKAR CHOS GSUM PA SEMS CAN KUN LA STON PA'I 'DU SHES BSKYED CING DAG SNANG SBYOR BA,
The third black deed is to say something unpleasant to a bodhisattva out of
anger. The antidote for doing this is the third white deed, which is to try to
conceive of every sentient being as the Teacher himself, and to see all beings
and things as totally pure.

NAG CHOS BZHI PA SEMS CAN GANG LA YANG LHAG BSAM MIN PA'I G-YO SGYU BYED PA, DE'I GNYEN POR DKAR CHOS GNYIS PA SEMS CAN KUN LA G-YO SGYU MED PAR DRANG PO'I BSAM PA LA GNAS PA SOGS BSLAB BYA 'DI RNAMS LA NAN TAN GYIS BSLAB PAR BYA BA'O, ,
The fourth black deed is to act in a devious way with any living being, without
any sense of personal responsibility for their enlightenment. The antidote for
doing this is the second white deed, where you maintain an attitude of total
honesty towards every living being, free of any kind of deception.

How to Keep Your Bodhisattva Vows
The following selections again are taken from the Highway for Bodhisattvas:

GNYIS PA DE LAS SEMS BSRUNG BA'I TSUL NI, BYANG SEMS RNAMS KYI BSLAB PA'I GZHI SNGAR BSHAD PA 'DI DAG NI MDO SDE LAS DNGOS SU BYUNG BA SHA STAG STE TSUL KHRIMS GSUM LA BRTZAMS NAS STON PAS MDO SDE GZHAN DANG GZHAN DU THOR BU THOR BUR GSUNGS PA'I THOR BU DE DAG BYANG SEMS KYI SDE SNOD KYI MA MO 'DIR PHYOGS GCIG DANG RGYUN GCIG TU TSANG BAR 'PHAGS PA THOGS MED KYIS BSHAD PA'O,
Here secondly are instructions for protecting your mind from these offenses.
Let us first say a word about all the details we have given thus far about the
rules that bodhisattvas must follow. There is not one of them which is not
taken directly from the sutras themselves; everything from the explanation of
the three types of morality on up can be found scattered throughout a variety
of sources spoken by the Teacher in the collection of sutras. These scattered
references were then explicated, in their entirety, by the realized being Asanga,
as he brought them into a single work, and a single lineage, here in the great
grandfather of all the books in the scriptural collection for bodhisattvas.

Since this code of life is such, since it is anything but something that someone
just made up, bodhisattvas should develop a sense of respect for it, and follow
its rules. This respect should lead them on to three excellent intentions, which
bring them to take the vows from another person, and then develop--from the
very depths of their hearts--a regard for the code that treats it as the highest
of all objects. Finally then they must keep to the code, never violating the
rules they have been given.

,BSAM PA GSUM NI, DE DAG LA SLOB PAR 'DOD PA'I BSAM PA RNAM PAR DAG PA DANG BYANG CHUB 'DOD PA'I BSAM PA DANG SEMS CAN GYI DON BYA BA'I BSAM PA'O,
The three excellent intentions are as follows:
* the pure intention where you wish to follow the rules;
* the intention where you wish to reach enlightenment; and
* the intention of working for the benefit of every living being.

21
How Some Vows are Broken More Seriously than Others

LNGA PA LTUNG BA CHE CHUNG GI DBYE BA NI   BYED PA LAS NI MI SHES PA DANG BAG MED KYIS BYAS PA CHUNG NGU NYON MONGS MANG BAS BYAS PA 'BRING MA GUS PAS BYAS PA CHEN PO'O,
The fifth part of our discussion concerns the division of the downfalls into
those which are more serious, and those which are less. As for the instigation,
those downfalls committed through ignorance of the vows or through
carelessness are the least serious. Those committed through an attack of
mental afflictions are moderately serious. And those committed through a lack
of respect for the vows are the most serious of all.

,BSAM PA LAS NI, DUG GSUM CHUNG 'BRING CHE GSUM GYIS BYAS PA RNAMS CHUNG 'BRING CHEN PO'O,
As for a person's state of mind, those downfalls committed through the three
mental poisons [of liking, disliking, or ignorance] in either lesser, medium, or
greater strength are--respectively--serious to a lesser, or medium, or greater
degree.

,GZHI LAS NI, BSAM PA MTSUNGS PAS GZHI RANG BZHIN GCIG LA BYAS KYANG CHUNG 'BRING CHEN POR 'GYUR BA YOD DE ZHE SDANG GI KUN DKRIS MTSUNGS PAS DUD 'GRO DANG PHA MA MA YIN PA'I MI'AM MIR CHAGS PA DANG MIR GYUR PA'I PHA MA BSAD NA RIM PA LTAR LTUNG BYED DANG MTSAMS MED MIN PA'I PHAM PA DANG MTSAMS MED PA'I PHAM PAR 'GYUR RO,
As for the object of the deed, there can also be cases where the downfall is
serious to a lesser, or medium, or greater degree even if it is committed in the
same state of mind towards different objects which share a common quality.
Suppose for example that an [ordained] person overwhelmed by the same
mental "chain," the same kind of dislike, kills any one of the following:
(1) an animal;
(2) a human or human fetus who is not their father or mother; or else
(3) a human who is their father or mother.

In the first case, you commit the kind of deed known as a "fall." In the second,
you commit a full defeat which is not one of the immediate misdeeds. In the
third case, you commit a full defeat which is one of the immediate misdeeds.
 , SOGS PA LAS CHUNG NGU SOGS SU 'GYUR BA NI, LTUNG BA GCIG NAS LNGA'I BAR DU BYUNG BA CHOS BZHIN DU PHYIR MI BYED PA NI CHUNG NGU DANG DRUG NAS GRANGS SHES PAR BYA NUS PA'I BAR DU BYUNG LA CHOS BZHIN DU PHYIR MI BYED PA NI 'BRING DANG LTUNG BA DPAG TU MED PA LA 'DI SNYED DO ZHES GRANGS SHES PAR MI NUS PA NI CHEN PO'O,
Here next is how downfalls become more or less serious through accumulation.
If you commit from one to five downfalls, and fail to rectify it in the proper
way, it is considered serious to a lesser degree. If you commit downfalls of a
quantity that is countable, and fail to rectify it in the proper way, it is
considered serious to a medium degree. If you commit a number of downfalls
which is beyond all estimation--that is, more than you could ever say just how
many there were--then it is considered serious to a greater degree.

,DE LTAR GSUNGS PA LA 'DIR NI NGO BO NYID DANG GZHI GNYIS JI BZHIN MI SBYAR BAR SKABS DANG BSTUN LA GZHAN GSUM 'DRA'O,
This is how it is explained in scripture; of the three different descriptions
presented there, the ones based on the nature and the object of the deed should
not be applied literally, but rather in the present context. The other three
though are just the same.

,DE LA MI SHES PAS LTUNG BA 'BYUNG BA NI, LTUNG BA MA THOS SHING MA RTOGS PAS BLO MA BYANG BA'I PHYIR LTUNG BA LA LTUNG BA MA YIN PAR 'DU SHES NAS LTUNG BA 'BYUNG BA'O,
Here is what we mean when we say that a person has committed a downfall
out of "ignorance." This is where the downfall is committed because the
person fails to conceive of the downfall as a downfall; this in turn occurs
because the person has not learned what the downfalls are: they have never
studied them, or understood them.

,SHES KYANG LTUNG BA 'BYUNG BA NI LTUNG BA LA BLO BYANG YANG BRJED NGES PA DANG SHES BZHIN MA 
YIN PAR GNAS PAS DRAN PA NYE BAR MI GNAS PA LAS LTUNG BA 'BYUNG BA'O,
Next is a case where you commit a downfall even though you know it's a
downfall. This happens when the downfall occurs because, despite the fact
that you have learned what all the downfalls are, you fail to keep your mind
on what you're doing. This itself occurs because you forget yourself, or fail to
stay watchful.

,NYON MONGS MANG BAS 'BYUNG BA NI, DUG GSUM SHAS CHE BAS 'DI NI BYA BA MA YIN NO SNYAM DU SHES KYANG RANG DBANG MED PAR 'BYUNG BA'O,
Here's what an "attack of mental affliction" refers to. This happens when one
of the three poisons takes over your mind, and you are helpless to keep
yourself from committing the bad deed; you do it even as you think to
yourself, "This is not something I should be doing."

,MA GUS PAS 'BYUNG BA NI, LTUNG BA LA BLO BYANG YANG DMAN PA LA MOS SHING , SNGON RGYU MA SPYAD PAS DGE SBYONG GI TSUL LA MA LTA ZHING MYANG 'DAS DANG CHOS DANG DGE 'DUN LA MA GUS PA DANG RJE SA MED PA DANG NGO TSA MED PA DANG BSLAB PA MI 'DOD PA DANG MA GUS PAS CI 'DOD DGUR LTUNG BA 'BYUNG BA'O, , DE'I DANG PO GNYIS KYIS NI NYON MONGS PA CAN MA YIN LA PHYI MA GNYIS KYIS NI NYON MONGS CAN KYI LTUNG BA 'BYUNG NGO , ZHES 'DUL BA'I MA MO BSDU BA LAS GSUNGS SO,
Committing a downfall out of a "lack of respect" means that you do so because,
even though you have already learned what the downfalls are, you commit one
of them anyway, for one of the nine reasons that follow: (1) You are still
attracted to a lower level of behavior; or (2) you fail to live the proper causes
in the past, and so you have no appreciation for the way of the practice of
virtue; or you have no respect for (3) the state of nirvana; or (4) the dharma;
or (5) the community; or else (6) you admit no object of veneration; or (7) you
have no sense of shame; or (8) you have no desire to follow the code; or (9)
you feel a kind of disrespect where you will do whatever you feel like doing.
The first two of the above lead to the kind of downfall which does not involve
mental affliction; the latter two lead to the kind which does. All the above is
quoted from the abbreviated form of the principal text on the practice of
discipline.

How to Avoid Breaking Your Bodhisattva Vows

Here are the antidotes for these four causes that lead you to commit a
downfall:
(1) Make yourself an expert in knowing what the downfalls are.
(2) Keep a high level of mindfulness and vigilance.
(3) Determine which of the mental afflictions is most prevalent in your
character, and make serious efforts to apply the appropriate
spiritual antidote.
(4) Develop a sense of shame, and consideration; maintain deep feelings
of respect for the Teacher, and for the precepts.
************
For the next selection we return to the String of Shining Jewels:
Whenever you perform any of the confessions mentioned throughout here you
must do so with all four of the antidote forces complete. Here too is a method
for restoring your vows before the community in the ceremony of restoration
and purification, or on any similar occasion.
First make three prostrations; stay standing then and bow, with your palms
joined at your breast. Speak the following:
I call on all the Buddhas, and every bodhisattva, and the entire
bodhisattva community in every corner of the universe. I am
now going to perform the ceremony for restoring my vows, for
I have made a uncountable number of mistakes while trying to
keep them. In great respect, I request that you listen.
Then crouch down, join your palms at your breast, and repeat the following
three full times:
I call on all the Buddhas, and every bodhisattva, and the entire
bodhisattva community in every corner of the universe. I am the

bodhisattva named (state your own name), and I have made an
uncountable number of mistakes by committing certain actual
deeds, or else actions that are similar to these deeds, which
represent stains of the lesser or medium kind, and are included
into the group of eighteen root downfalls. In particular I have
made the mistake of (choose the appropriate downfall or
downfalls listed next), which is completely against the tradition
of the bodhisattva vows, as described in the following lines, and
other verses from the ancient books which tell how one commits
a root failure.
Because of an attachment to gain or honor,
You praise yourself and criticize others.
From possessiveness you don't give Dharma
Or things to the suffering, with no protector.
You won't listen to another's apology,
And out of anger strike someone else.
You do something to give up the greater way,
You teach a false dharma, or else you steal
Things that belong to the Three Jewels.
These, we say, are the failures of vows.
Beyond these I have made an uncountable number of mistakes
by committing certain actual deeds, or else actions that are
similar to these deeds, which are included into the group of
forty-six secondary offenses. In particular I have made the
mistake of (state the appropriate offense or offenses), which is
completely against the tradition of the bodhisattva vows, as
described in the following lines, and other verses from the
ancient books which tell how one commits the secondary
offenses.
You fail to offer thrice to the Three Jewels,
Or else you let a thought of desire go on.
Beyond these too, I have failed to think, six times each day, of the
good things that come from developing the wish to become
enlightened for all living beings.
I have failed to bring up in my heart, six times per day, the
prayer for this wish for enlightenment.
In my heart, I have given up on certain persons.
I have not made true efforts to amass the two great collections,
of merit and wisdom.

I have not tried to stop the four black actions.
I have not tried to follow the four white actions.
I have not made true efforts to train myself in vowed morality,
and the morality of collecting goodness, and the morality of
working for all living beings.
I have not made true efforts to train myself in the six perfections
of giving and he rest.
I have not made true efforts in working for all living beings
through the four ways of collecting disciples.
When the time came for me to make efforts in preparing Dharma
and material things for those who needed them, I have failed to
make such efforts.
I have grasped to my conceptions of being helped or harmed by
others, and based on that I have distinguished between them,
and begun to take sides, and started then to like some people,
and dislike other people, and not care at all about others.
I have not taken myself to holy ones for instruction.
I have not followed the practices of proper learning and contemplation
in both the profound and the far-reaching traditions of the bodhisattvas.
When making use of food, or clothes, or various kinds of furniture, I
have failed to do so with thoughts of helping others.
When practicing giving and the rest of the six perfections, I have failed
to do so with a heart filled with thoughts of helping others.
I have failed to make efforts in activities that would bring help and
happiness to others, and that would take away their suffering.
In short, I have made an uncountable number of mistakes which are
completely against the tradition of the bodhisattva vows. I, the
bodhisattva named (state your name), do hereby admit these mistakes
in the presence of all the Buddhas, and every bodhisattva, and the entire
bodhisattva community from every corner of the universe. I openly
admit them, I hide nothing, I reveal them all. And I swear that, from
this moment on, I will keep myself from all such deeds.
By admitting all, and revealing all, I shall be at peace; but not admitting,
and not revealing, I cannot be at peace.

When this is said, a person who is fitting to act as the head of the ceremony,
or the like, should repeat three times the question of seeing and restraining:
Do you truly see that these are mistakes?
And then the others should respond,
I do.
Then the head should say,
From now on, will you restrain yourself?
And the others should respond,
From now on, I will.
Alternately they can answer,
I make the most pure and solemn vow to do so, in all keeping with the
Dharma, and the teachings of discipline.
After the three repetitions, the statement of receiving and affirming should be
made.

Hell beings, craving spirits, animals,
Men, six different types of pleasure beings:
These are the realm of desire. They are twenty
By dividing up hell and the continents.
[III.1-4]

One may begin with the following question:
Above, you mentioned "states of mental affliction with three
realms." With these and other references you have been
indicating that the mind and mental functions, as well as other
objects, may be divided into categories that relate to three
different realms. Just what are these three realms?
These three are the desire realm, the form realm, and the formless realm. We'll
start by describing the first of them.

Hell beings [Sanskrit: naraka] are so called because they live without [Skt: na]
any comfort [Skt: rañj]. Craving spirits [preta] are so called either because they
come to their state without turning back [apunara¯vr¸t] or because they are
overcome [pari¯ta] by thirst. Animals [tiryañca] are given this name because
they go along on all fours, in a bent-over position [tiryac]. Men get their name
from their mental prowess [the Sanskrit etymology also holds in English], and
the six different types of pleasure beings or gods [divaukas] of the desire
realm are so called because their homes are in the sky [div]. These are the
realm of desire.

GNAS LA SOGS PA MA NGES PA'I PHYIR RO,
The realm of desire may also be divided into twenty different classes of beings.
By dividing hell into the eight hot hells, we get a total of ten different births
of misery. By dividing human beings up into those belonging to each of the
four continents, we get a total of ten happy kinds of birth. There is a reason
why we make no separate count of the eight cold hells and various partial
hells: the former are not the principal hells, and the latter are indefinite as to
lifespans, locations, and so on.

Someone may ask why we call it the "desire realm." We do so because it is a
realm full of desire. And what is desire? Craving aimed at getting sex or
food.

Consider now the seventeen different locations above it--above the desire

desire realm and can lead to the development of the particular mental
afflictions of this level. Secondly, it is a realm where form reaches its height.

This realm of form has seventeen parts in that there are three levels each
corresponding to each of the first three of the various types of concentration
that act as causes for a birth in "it"--that is, the form realm. And there are
eight different levels that correspond to the fourth and final type of
concentration. These correspondences are as follows.

RGYU SNYOMS 'JUG GI BSAM GTAN DANG PO CHUNG 'BRING CHEN PO GSUM BSGOMS PA LAS, TSANGS RIS, TSANGS PA MDUN NA 'DON, TSANGS CHEN GSUM DU RIM BZHIN DU SKYE,
One may engage in three different degrees of causal meditation relating to the
first concentration level: these are the greater, the medium, and the lesser.
These three degrees of meditation cause one to take birth, respectively, into the
levels known as "Class of the Pure," "Reciting Before the Pure One," and "the
Great Pure One."

Meditation on the same three degrees, relating to the second concentration
level, leads to respective births in the levels known as "Lesser Light,"
"Immeasurable Light," and "Clear Light." Meditation again on the three

degrees, those related to the third concentration level, leads to respective births
in the levels known as "Lesser Virtue," "Immeasurable Virtue," and
"Widespread Virtue."

Meditation on the stained parts of the fourth concentration level by ordinary
beings leads them to a birth at one of the three stages. They are known as
"Cloudless," "Birth of Merit," and the "Great Result." When realized beings
meditate on five different stages of the fourth concentration level, they take
their respective births in what are called the "Five Pure Places." The five causal
stages are known as "the lesser" (three alternations), "the medium" (six
alternations), "the great" (nine alternations), "the very great," (twelve
alternations), and "the really very great" (fifteen alternations).

There is no place for the formless realm;
Four kinds, depending on that given rise.

There is no other, separate place for the formless realm. A person who is
born there must first have attained single-pointed concentration relating to the
formless realm, and must not have lost this ability since that time. When such
a person dies and migrates, he is born into the formless realm at the very place
where he died, the four "name" heaps of the formless realm coming into
existence there. There are however four kinds of levels to the formless realm,
depending on the relative quality of that meditation to which one had given
rise and which had caused his birth there. These are the levels known as the
"Door of Limitless Space" and so on.

"If there's no form in the formless realm," one may ask, "then what provides
a basis for the stream of mind there?" In this one--in the formless realm--the
continuum of the mind is based on the continuation of a discrete type of
being and upon life, as well. The words "as well" are meant to indicate that
this stream of mind is also based on the ordinary being, on the factors not
linked with mind, on holds, on the characteristics of birth, and so on.

CI'I PHYIR GZUGS MED KHAMS ZHES BYA ZHE NA, GZUGS GTAN NAS MED PA'I KHAMS YIN PAS NA DE SKAD CES BYA'O,
And why is this realm called the "formless realm"? It is given the name

Now there are five types of birth, those of a hell being and the rest, in
them--in the three realms. They are indicated by their own separate names:
hell beings, craving spirits, animals, humans, and pleasure beings. [Refer to
the Sanskrit etymologies for these types listed in the commentary to the first
verse of this chapter.]

"If there are only five types of birth," one may ask, "then in which of these two
types do you include the lesser pleasure beings?" According to realized master
Asanga,

...They are to be included among the full-fledged pleasure beings.
This is because they vie with these beings in their physical
appearance and material wealth, and belong to the same family.
The lesser pleasure beings are though inferior in their qualities to
the complete pleasure beings, and thus we refer to them as
"pleasure beings" but [in Sanskrit and Tibetan] with the negative
attached to their name, to indicate inferiority.

,MDO DRAN PA NYER GZHAG LAS LHA MA YIN YI DVAGS DANG DUD 'GROR GTOGS PA DANG , MDO KHA CIG TU 'GRO BA DRUG PAR YANG BSHAD DO,
The sutra called Constant Recollection explains that the lesser pleasure beings
should be grouped with craving spirits or among the animals. A number of
other sutras also teach them as being a sixth type of being.

As for harmful spirits, some may be counted among the pleasure beings, and
others among the craving spirits. The spirits known as "those who live on
smells" are grouped into the pleasure beings, as they serve as their musicians.
The great garuda birds, the "big-belly" and "humanoid" spirits, as well as the
serpent-like naga creatures are all explained as belonging to the animal type.
 SHA ZA DANG , SMYO BYED DANG , BRJED BYED DANG , MA MO NI YI DVAGS KYI NANG DU 'DU BA YIN NO,
The spirits known as "flesh-eaters," "crazy-makers," and "those who cause

of craving spirits.

"In the lines above," one may begin, "you mentioned beings' entering the womb
`because of a mistaken impression.' Does this hold true in every case?" One
type is cognizant of what they are doing while they are entering the womb,
yet lose this awareness during their stay there. Another type is cognizant not
only of entering the womb but while they are staying there too. Still others
are moreover cognizant as they issue from the womb as well. One more type
is ignorant of all three, cognizant of neither entering, nor staying in, nor
issuing from the womb. Those who are born from eggs, even if they are self-
made victors, are always of this last type, and it alone--ignorant. This is what
they say.

"Just who is it," one may ask, "that represents each of these three types--those
who are cognizant of entering the womb but not staying there, and so on?"
Three are the types who enter the womb as such; respectively, wheel-

empowered emperors and the two "self-born"--referring to self-made victors
and Buddhas. They enter as they do due to the fact that they have been able,
respectively, to amass vast collections of deeds (referring in this case to merit),
wisdom, and merit and wisdom both.

The Lives of Craving Spirits
The following selection is taken from the Great Book on the Steps of the Teaching,
composed by the Kadampa Geshe Drolungpa, Lodru Jungne (c. 1100 AD).

I have already explained how the deeds which lead to a life as a craving spirit
or an animal are precisely medium or lesser instances of the ten wrong actions.
Now I will describe these two kinds of beings themselves, from the point of
view of specific characteristics.

It comes from a part or parts of the ten paths of deeds,
But mostly because the person's misled by his cheapness
Or jealousy and forgets the three kinds of giving.
He neglects to share with all who were offered a thing,
Reduces what was earmarked, or never gives it at all,
Redirects it, prevents it, or anything of the like.
A mind full of this dirt collects a mass of loathsome deeds;
Awesome strong, they drag him down to the life of a craving spirit.

Here a "part" of the ten bad deeds can refer to performing them to a medium
extent, or else to a "part" in the sense of some residual karmic energy from
having performed them to a greater extent. A part or parts like this lead to
this particular rebirth, as do the following deeds described in the text called
Constant Awareness:

Most of these are people who were misled by their own cheapness, or by their
desire for the miserable possessions of this world, or who were overwhelmed
by a hope for the miserable offerings that are all someone here can present you
with. And because of this they found they could not give to others. They

could not give to any of those who might come to ask: they gave neither to
practitioners of the Dharma, nor to Brahmins, nor the poor, nor needy, nor
destitute. They did no good deeds. They observed nothing of that great sea
of ethical living, neither for this life, nor for the life beyond. They provided
nothing for their children, or for their wives, or to the men and women who
served them, or to all the others whom it was their responsibility to sustain
with meat and bread. Their cheapness swindled them out of all they could
hope for, in this world and the next. They are people too who were swindled
by their quarreling, or by jealousy. These for the most part then are the kinds
of people who take birth as craving spirits; and most of them turn into those
craving spirits who are witches.

,DE BZHIN DU BSNGOS NAS MA BYIN PA LA SOGS PA LAS NGAN PA MANG PO DAG GIS KYANG NGO ,
In addition to these kinds of actions there is failing to hand over offerings that
were earmarked for a certain virtuous purpose, and all the rest: a whole mass
of different bad deeds that can lead you to this kind of birth.

They're of three types, distinguished by the obstacles to what
They live on: outer problems and inner, problems with food
Or drink. All of them share though the infinite pain
Of hunger and thirst, intense as the flames of a fire.

The sufferings of these craving spirits can all be reduced to three different
kinds. First are those with outer obstacles to what they need to live on.
People like this approach a place like a mountain spring, or a pond or stream,
and catch sight of something that they could eat or drink. They race ahead to
get it, only to be forced back by beings cutting them with knives, or beating
them with clubs and such. Or else they come to the side of some water and
find themselves unable to drink of it, for then it looks to them like blood and
pus or the like.

Those craving spirits with inner obstacles have mouths no bigger than the eye
of a needle, spouting with flame. Their throats are the size of a guitar string,
but their bellies are huge. Even where there is no one to stop them, and even
when they can locate something to eat or drink, they find themselves unable
to get it down.

Next are the craving spirits with obstacles to what they can eat or drink. An
example would be the spirit whose name was "The Necklace of Flame." Every
single thing this spirit tried to eat, and every single thing it tried to drink as
well, would burn it instead; and whatever went down would anyway never
relieve those feelings of hunger and thirst.

Some of these spirits are referred to as the "ones who eat filth." This refers to
the fact that they are forced to eat feces, and drink urine; they are completely
unable to partake of anything other than putrid, poisonous, disgusting
excrement. Others are constantly cutting off pieces of their own flesh to get
something to eat; they can never find anything which is clean, or fresh.

All of them have the look of a scorched piece of wood; the searing pain of
hunger and thirst have dried up all their skin and flesh and blood. Their
entire look has changed: their faces are covered with hair; their visage is gaunt,
from hunger and thirst; their tongues pass over their lips, dry, and parched.
They run from place to place, terrified, and aimless.

For more detail on the karma and suffering of these spirits, you should study
further the sutras themselves. The further divisions of the spirits into a
multitude of different types all come from particulars of the karma involved
in creating them, which comes itself from the great variety of motivations
present in their past deeds. As such, the full range of different kinds of
suffering, and thoughts, and migrations, and locations of these craving spirits
is simply beyond all reckoning.

The great majority of these beings have fallen to their current state because of
cheapness and jealousy; they have created the karmic power of the ten bad
deeds, in their actions and speech and thoughts, to an overwhelming degree.
What was the cause of these deeds? All of them are performed relative to
other living beings; it is towards them that we act; and the karma we collect
comes through the way we relate to them, flows from our interaction with
others. We may be wandering again and again through births of misery, but
it seems that still we are not tired of it.

Our minds, like restless monkeys, have lived in the circle of suffering life for
time with no beginning. We have grown accustomed to staying out in a rain
of all kinds of suffering. Weighted down in the shackles of a whole variety of
different bodies, we drag ourselves again and again up the great mountain of
the wheel of rebirth. But still this is something we find hard to realize, to
recognize, for our minds are filled with the habits of our suffering past. We
must seek, from the beginning, to control this restless monkey--the mind
flitting constantly from one thing to another. If we fail in this task we will
only come to the unstoppable torment of the lower realms; locked in the circle
of birth by the enemy of our own minds, we will forever lose any kind of
happiness.

If you want to know then what it is that brings a person to the birth of a
craving spirit, it is primarily the failure to perform the three kinds of giving,
and being overcome by the emotions of cheapness, and jealousy. [The three
kinds of giving are: giving material needs, giving freedom from fear, and
giving the Dharma.]

Their heads are caught in the noose of incredibly
Powerful karma, which drags them helplessly on;
Neither spiritual guides, nor their children or wife,
Nor other loved ones can help them in the least.
On the whole, their size and lifespan are nothing fixed;
The longest is five hundred days that are made of months.

The bodily dimensions of beings in all three of the lower realms are nothing
that are fixed; the size of the body they possess, and the suffering that they can
therefore feel, increase according to the power of the karma they have collected
previously. On the whole, the lifespans of craving spirits are nothing which
is fixed; the very longest they can live is five hundred days which each last as
long as a month among human beings.

The Lives of Animals

`, DUD 'GRO'I SKYE GNAS KYI RGYU DANG SDUG BSNGAL GYI KHYAD PAR NI,
Next we will describe the lives of animals, first from the point of view of what
causes this type of birth, and what types of suffering they have.

Next is what comes from a part or parts of bad deeds,
And mainly from lesser forms of the acts of fools,
Collecting bad karma from disregarding, and such.
You fall to an animal birth, killing and eating each other,
Or becoming the property of pleasure beings or men,
Helplessly slaughtered, or forced to do their bidding.

What causes a person to be born as an animal are the parts of the ten bad
deeds which are considered lesser forms of these deeds. In particular are cases
where especially ignorant people disregard minor rules of morality, and do so
on a continual basis; or else where they collect a great number of wrong deeds
such as failing to act with respect towards those who are worthy of such
respect.

How is it that these animals suffer? They kill each other, and use each other
for food: the ones that are bigger, or more powerful, slay and devour the
others, swallowing them even before they have stopped breathing, and such.
Or else they hurt each other, in every imaginable way. Some kinds of animals
become possessions of humans or other types of beings, and are slaughtered
for their meat, or skins, or bones and the rest. Or else they are forced to do the
bidding of their masters; mercilessly and helplessly they are sheared or milked
or herded or saddled or dragged along--whatever their owners wish.

The Six Sufferings of Human Life
The following selection is taken from the Chest of Riches, by Master Ngulchu
Dharma Bhadra (1772-1851), an important link in the lineage leading from Je
Tsongkapa, through Pabongka Rinpoche, and down to our own root lama, Khen
Rinpoche Geshe Lobsang Tharchin. The work is a commentary on the Path of Ease,
a famous lam-rim text by His Holiness the First Panchen Lama, Lobsang Chukyi
Gyeltsen (1567?-1662).

,SDUG BSNGAL DRUG BSAM PA DNGOS NI, BSDOMS LA,
Here next is the actual contemplation of the six forms of suffering. A
summary of these in verse goes as follows:

,SDUG BSNGAL DRUG NI NGES MED NGOM MI SHES,
,YANG YANG LUS 'DOR YANG YANG NYING MTSAMS SBYOR,
,YANG YANG MTHO DMAN DU GYUR GROGS MED PA'O,
Life has no certainty, we know no satisfaction, and shed our bodies
Over and over, take birth again, over and over, go over and over
From high to low, with no companion: and so we suffer, six ways.

,ZHES PA LTAR NGES PA MED PA NI GZHAN YANG GNAS 'KHOR BA 'DIR RGYU LAS NYON GNYIS KYI NGO BO SKYE BA ZHIG BLANGS PHYIN CHAD 'BRAS BU SDUG BSNGAL GYI RANG BZHIN LAS MA 'DAS TE, DGRA GNYEN DU 'GYUR BA DANG ZHES SOGS TE, BSHES SPRINGS LAS,
The first of the sufferings mentioned here is [1] the fact that life has no
certainity. We have taken birth here, in the cycle of suffering, and by its very
nature our birth has two causes: the pair of our own past deeds, and our
mental afflictions. The only result that can ever come from these two causes
is something which is, in its very essence, pain. And the kinds of pain that
come to us are those in the words that include the line, "Enemies turn to those
we love..." The Letter to a Friend describes this suffering as follows:

,PHA NI BU NYID MA NI CHUNG MA NYID,
,SKYE BO DGRAR GYUR PA DAG BSHES NYID DANG ,
,LDOG PA NYID DU MCHI BAS DE SLAD DU,
,'KHOR BA DAG NA NGES PA 'GA' MA MCHIS,
Your father turns to your very own son, your mother to your wife;
And the one who was your enemy becomes a relative dear to you.
The complete reverse of this happens too, and thus it is we say
That in the circle of life there is no certainty at all.

,ZHES RANG GI TSE SNGA MA'I PHA TSE 'DI LA BUR 'GYUR BA DANG , SNGA MA'I MA CHUNG MAR 'GYUR BA DANG , DGRA MDZA' BSHES SU 'GYUR BA DANG , YANG DE LAS GO LDOG STE SNGA

What this verse is saying is that it is possible for the person who was your
father in your last life to turn into your son in this life. Your mother in your
last life then can turn to your wife in this one. Your worst enemy can turn
into your dearest relative, and the complete reverse of all these can happen as
well: your son in your past life turns into your father in this one, and all the
rest--there is no absolutely no certainty who is who. And that's not all. Even
in this present life, we can see with our own two eyes how uncertain life can
be: a person who was ready to murder someone the year before becomes in the
following year their bosom friend, and so on. People though grasp to the
occasional appearance that these relationships are something that are certain,
and then begin to feel strong emotions of attachment, or anger. These lead
them to spend their lives helping some people, and hurting others. They act
like some kind of animal, dazed and confused, wandering aimlessly across
some great wasteland. The animal runs, with no idea what it does, exhausting
itself in the pursuit of what seems to be some great goal. And then some man
appears and shouts at it, "What are you doing!" And then the animal reverses
direction, and runs just as purposefully the opposite way. So give up now this
tendency you have of making any distinction between your friends and your
enemies, this habit of liking the friends, and disliking the enemies. Come to
realize that there is not a single object in this entire suffering life that you can
trust. Study to find disgust for this kind of existence.

,NGOM MI SHES PA NI, 'KHOR BA'I BDE BA JI TZAM SPYAD KYANG ZHES SOGS TE,
The next suffering, [2] the fact that we can never find any sense of satisfaction,
is described in the words that include, "No matter what kind of happiness you
find here in the circle of suffering life..." The verse here is:

,RE RES RGYA MTSO BZHI LAS LHAG PA YI,
,'O MA 'THUNGS TE DA DUNG SO SO YI,
,SKYE BO'I RJES SU 'BRANG BA'I 'KHOR BA PAS,
,DE BAS CHES MANG NYID GCIG BTUNG 'TSAL LO,
Each one of us has fed upon a massive amount of milk
Exceeding the water in all four seas; and those still living within
This suffering life, who follow the way of ordinary beings,
Can still expect to drink a measure infinitely more.

,ZHES 'GRO BA RE RE'I LUS BLANGS PA'I 'O MA'I NU ZHO 'THUNGS BA RNAMS MA GOD PAR BSAGS NA RGYA MTSO CHEN PO BZHI LAS KYANG LHAG PA ZHIG 'THUNGS PA STE RGYA MTSO BZHI NI PHYI RGYA MTSO CHEN PO LA RI RAB KYI MDANGS 'PHOG LUGS KYIS KHA DOG BZHI'I SGO NAS BZHAG LA, DE RNAMS LA GTING MTHA' SOGS KYI TSAD BZHAG NUS PA DANG RANG GI SKYE BA'I YA MTHA' LA TSAD MED PA'I PHYIR RGYA MTSO LAS MANG BA ZHIG 'THUNGS ZIN CING , DA DUNG LAM LA MI SLOB MAR SO SO SKYE BO'I RJES SU 'BRANG NA DE BAS CHES MANG BA ZHIG BTUNG DGOS PA'I DON NO,
The point of the verse is as follows. Suppose that you could manage to bring
back, and collect together all the mothers' milk that you had ever fed upon in
all the different bodies you have taken upon yourself. The massive amount of
this milk would exceed the water in all four seas. The "four seas" here are
different parts of the greater outer ocean, named from the four different hues
of its four quarters as the colors of Mount Supreme reflect upon them.
Even the deepest parts of these seas, and their other distances, are something
that it is possible to measure; yet the number of births that you and I have
taken are limitless in number. As such we have already drunk more milk of

our mothers than the water these seas hold in them. And if we continue the
way we are, if we go on following the life of ordinary beings, failing to practice
the path, then we can still expect to drink a measure of milk which is infinitely
more.

,DE ZHES PA NI SNGAR 'THUNGS PA LA GO BAR MI BYA STE SNGAR 'THUNGS PA LA TSAD BZHAG TU MED LA DES NA RGYA MTSO BZHI LAS MANG BA ZHIG DA DUNG 'THUNG DGOS PA'I DON NO,
The meaning of the words "a measure infinitely more" is not "infinitely more
than what they drank before," since the milk we have sucked in the past is
itself beyond all measurement. The point rather is that we will from this point
on be forced to drink again a quantity that is greater than all the water in the
four seas.

The whole point of enjoying things which are pleasant is to bring ourselves
some kind of contentment. The fact though is that, no matter how much
pleasure we may feel with a thing in this cycle of suffering, we never reach
any sense of satisfaction. Much less; for the normal reaction is that our feelings
of attachment grow more, and this forces us to wander around even longer in
the circle of life. And what the pleasures end up bringing to us are great many
different kinds of suffering--unbearable pains that dwarf the pleasures
themselves.

So too there was in days long ago a wonderful child who was born from the
head of a king named Gupali. The child was named "Headborn," and known
as well as "Nurse-from-me." The astrologers foretold that he would someday
be the emperor of the world.
This prince sought to make great efforts in doing good deeds, in order to
provide for the food, clothing, and other needs of his people. After inquiring
into the ways of bringing this about, he made great prayers that his subjects
would be able to find the food, clothing, and other needs without any effort at
all. As a result, people began to get anything they wished for: crops sprang
forth without anyone ever planting them; jewels fell like raindrops from the
sky; clothing grew like leaves from the branches of wonderful trees; and the
like.
Because of the incredible force of the good deeds he had done, Headborn came
to be emperor over our entire world, the continent of Dzambu.

Dissatisfied with only this much, he then went to the eastern continent of
Greatbody, and took it over as well. Dissatisfied with only this much, he then
went to the western continent of Cattle-Users, and took it over as well.
Dissatisfied with only this much, he hen went to the northern continent of
Unpleasant Sound and took it over as well. Dissatisfied with only this much,
he went to the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, and appropriated half the throne
of Shakra, the king of the full pleasure beings. He reigned there with this
being, for the length of 137 years.
Then, during the time of the Buddha named Kashyapa, a war with the lesser
pleasure beings broke out. Even Shakra found himself unable to repulse them,
but Headborn was successful. Then an evil thought began to form in his mind:
dissatisfied with the idea of continuing to share his power with Shakra, he
decided that he would have to murder the being.
This single thought erased all the good energy that was keeping Headborn in
this realm, and he fell back to Dzambu Continent. Not long after that he was
on his deathbed, ready to pass on to the next world. His ministers crowded
around him, and asked the mighty being what it was that could force him to
leave them so. And then it was that he gave his famous reply, describing how
his bad thoughts had brought him to death, and so on.

The next suffering is [3] the fact that we have to shed our bodies, over and
over. This is indicated in the lines that include, "It doesn't matter what
wonderful kind of body I may be able to attain..." The point here is that,
regardless of all the bad deeds we might accumulate in order to maintain this
body we have now, it is an absolute certainty that--in the end--we will be
forced to shed it. The power of the wrong deeds we did for the sake of the
body though we carry along in our mind, and they bring to us the eventual
result of unbearable pain.
Beyond this are the lines that say,
The size of the stack of rotting corpses
belonging to each of us
Would exceed an equivalent to the height
of Mount Supreme itself.
Suppose that you could put together a huge stack of all the skeletons left from
the bodies that any particular person had ever taken on, and then left behind.
This stack would be more immense than Summit, the great mountain at the
middle of the world.
The difficult expression nyechik here is meant to indicate "a quantity equivalent
to the height," which is then exceeded.

The next suffering is [4] the fact that we have to take birth again, over and
over. The text at this point includes the line, "Since we have, for time with no
beginning, been forced to take birth again, over and over..."
The Tibetan expression for "taking birth again" here is nying tsam jorwa, and is
somewhat unusual. The nying means "again," and appears with the same sense
in a number of other terms. One is nying-gu, "ultimate goal," or the further
goal within a goal. Another is nying-lak, "appendage," meaning a further limb
[such as a finger] splitting off from what is already a limb [such as an arm].

The point of the expression nying tsam jorwa then is to emphasize that, during
our lives in this circle of suffering, we have not just crossed the border [tsam
jorwa] between death and life at some isolated instance in the past, but rather
that we have done so again and again [nying].

Beyond this we see the lines that say,
Suppose you tried to count the mothers all the way back
to the beginning, using tiny balls
Of earth the size of juniper berries; the fact though is that
the planet would not be enough.
Suppose, says the verse, that you took tiny bits of dirt from this massive planet
Earth and rolled them up into little balls the size of juniper berries. Then you
used them to count all the mothers: you start with the one who was your
mother this time, and then her mother, and then her mother's mother, and so
on. The dirt contained in the entire planet would run out before you finished
your counting.

The next suffering is [5] the fact that we have to go from a high position to a
low position, over and over again. This is indicated in the lines that include,
"No matter how many good things you get in this cycle of suffering..." As the
verse says,
First you reach the level of the one named Shakra,
and merit the gifts of everyone in the world;

Then because of the force of past deeds done
you fall again to the surface of the earth.
First you reach the level of an emperor
who with the wheel reigns over all the world;
Then in the realms of the circle of birth
you become again the lowest of slaves.

As the Word of the Discipline says,
A high position eventually leads to a fall,
And relationships always come to separation;
Life itself leads in its end to death.
The point here is that any good thing that ever happens here in the circle of
suffering life eventually turns into some kind of problem. Try to concentrate
on this pattern that life shows us: how we always go from something high to
something low. Try to develop a healthy disgust for this kind of existence.

The final suffering is [6] the fact that we have no companion. This suffering
is indicated in the lines about "going by oneself, alone, with no companion at
all..." As the Bodhisattva's Life says,
Consider even just the body we have;
If the flesh and bone that come with it
Must one day rot and be parted from it,
What need then to talk of our other friends?
All who are born are born alone,
And all who die by themselves;
Since they can't share the slightest bit of your pain,
What use are the friends that hold you back?
As the verse points out, we tend to collect a great variety of different bad
deeds for the sake of our friends. But when the time comes to experience the
consequences of these actions, none of these same friends can participate in our
pain at all. And in those situations where we try to practice some Dharma,
these friends tend to hold us back. So what use are they, anyway?

death here with the present stream of heaps and the point of the being at
birth. These between beings are though not yet "arrived," for they have yet
to reach the destination towards which they travel.

Now a member of the "Majority Group" of philosophers might come and say
that there is no being between death and birth--that the being at birth comes
right from the end of the being at death. Consider though the being at birth.
It doesn't just occur from the end of the being at death, because it is a thing
that goes along in a stream of consecutive stages, continuing on like the seeds
for crops of grain. [That is, a seed turning into a fully developed plant
requires the inbetween stage of a young sprout. Just so, an inbetween life is
required for the being to move from the location of death to the location of
rebirth. (This explanation is from the famed commentary of Chim Jampay
Yang.)]

Beings in the state between death and rebirth are something that exist, as we
hear from the Victor's own lips in the sutra on The Seven Types of Lives, where
it mentions "There are seven types of lives: life as a hell being," and so on.

Another sutra concurs:
If three conditions are present, a child will form in the mother's
womb. These are (1) a being suitable to be a mother, and who
is still menstruating; (2) a feeling of desire and then sexual
contact between the prospective parents; and (3) the proximity of
one of the beings who live on smells.
This proves the existence of the intermediate being first because it comes from
the Buddha, and secondly because the phrase "beings who live on smells" in
the quotation refers to none other than the intermediate being.

What does the body of an inbetween being look like? The being between
death and rebirth has the image of the being "before," or the being which is
going to come into existence. This is because both the intermediate being and
the being of the next life are thrown into the future by the same projecting
force--the deeds they did in the past. This expression, the "being before," is
meant to refer to the one that consists of the five (or four) heaps that exist
before the point that one has already died (up through the moment of death)
but after the moment of birth (the second moment of birth and so on).

What color is an intermediate being? An inbetween being headed for the hells
has the color of a scorched stump of wood. Those to be animals are the color
of smoke; craving spirits have a look like water. Those to become pleasure
beings of the desire realm, or humans, possess a golden color. Inbetween
beings for the form realm are white. No intermediate being exists for the
formless realm, as there is no form there.

How big are intermediate beings? Those to become pleasure beings of the
desire realm, or humans, are the size of five or six-year old children. Those
headed for the form realm possess more of a sense of shame and conscience
than not, so have the body of a mature adult and are fully clothed at birth.
Those of the desire realm have a greater share of shamelessness and a lack of
conscience, so are naked at their birth. There was though the nun known as
"Lady of White," who was born with clothes by force of her former prayers to
that effect. Bodhisattvas in their final life are as well from infancy possessed
of the special bodily signs and marks, and clothing.

How Long Do You Stay in the Intermediate State?

"How long then," one may ask, "does a being stay in the intermediate state?"
The Sutrist called the "Venerable Layman with Vows" makes the claim that
"There is no fixed time: the intermediate being remains in this state until all the
factors necessary for birth have come together." And the master Vasumitra
claims that "they stay for a period of seven days. If by the end of this time
they have failed to find a new birth, they die and migrate into yet another
intermediate state." Still others claim that the intermediate being stays for
seven weeks--a total of 49 days.

The Detailists make another claim:
A being in the intermediate state is one in an active search for his
rebirth, so his conception into a new birth occurs relatively
quickly, before he has spent any great amount of time in this
state. If his birth in a certain place is a fixed thing but the
necessary factors have not yet assembled, the force of his past
deeds will pull these factors together and he will take birth there.
If his birth in the particular place is not a fixed thing, he will then
simply take birth somewhere else.

Suppose too that it is winter and someone has reached an intermediate state
from which he is supposed to take rebirth as a cow. Since cows mate in the
summer, he will instead take birth as a similar animal without a definite
mating season. If in winter also a person has come to an intermediate state
from which he is meant to take birth as a horse, we will instead be born as a
donkey--since donkeys mate in any season, but horses in spring.

If again in summer a person has reached the state between death and rebirth
and is supposed to be born as a bear, he will take birth as a dre-creature. They
mate in no particular season, while bears mate only in the winter. If, finally,
it is summer and a person has become an intermediate being meant to be born
as a dog, he'll take his rebirth as a wolf: they mate any time, dogs only in
autumn.

"Who," one may ask, "can see an intermediate being?" Intermediate beings, at
least those of the same type, can be seen by each other. Some people have
claimed that intermediate beings headed for a birth as a pleasure being can see
those for all the other types of beings, and that intermediate beings to be born
as humans, craving spirits, animals, and hell-beings can each see all but the
preceding types.

Intermediate beings can also be seen by using what is called the "eye of a god."
It must be one which is clear, free of the eleven typical faults. These eleven
are (1) doubt, (2) failing to direct one's attention properly, (3) improper
physical states, (4) a feeling of dullness or sleepiness, (5) mental excitation, (6)
an excessive application of effort, (7) vacant mental wandering, (8) anxiety, (9)
too many different ideas, (10) talking too much, and (11) trying too hard to
meditate.

Intermediate beings have a capability to perform miraculous feats that comes
through the power of deeds. They can fly through the sky, and display a
special strength, or capacity to travel at extraordinary speeds. All their
powers, those of the eye and the rest, are complete--and they have the ability
to pass through mountains and so forth without being stopped. Evidence of
this fact is the presence of frogs and other types of creatures found in the
middle of rocks with no openings at all.

"Is it then possible," one may ask, "for a person to be diverted to another type
of birth after he has already taken form as an intermediate being headed for
the hells?" You are never diverted to another birth: the energy of one's past
deeds which is throwing forth the intermediate being headed for the hells is
the same energy that will project the being "before"--that is, the hell being
itself.

One can however reach the state of an intermediate being headed for the level
known as "Class of the Pure" and still not have to take birth there: cases where
one achieves nirvana between death and rebirth, as just such a being, do exist.

One may ask whether intermediate beings of the desire realm eat any physical
types of food. It is stated that those ones eat no gross kinds of physical food,
but rather live on mere smells. And the more powerful consume the good
smells, while the less powerful must eat the poor ones.

"How does an intermediate being," one may begin, "enter his particular state
of birth?" If he is an inbetween being headed for a birth as a human, he sees
his parents from a distance, having sex together. Because of a mistaken
impression, and imagining that he can play and enjoy himself, he passes to
his destination within the womb, lodged in the midst of the mother's abdomen
and entrails.

If the child is to be a boy, it lies crouched up on the right side of the mother's

position, depending on whether masculine or feminine types of desire
dominate his personality.

are--all based on a mistaken impression.

themselves, facing backwards.

"In the lines above," one may begin, "you mentioned that `beings are kept alive
by sustenance.' Just how many kinds of sustenance are there?" There are four
different kinds: sustenance in the form of solid food, contact, mental
movement, and consciousness.

"In what realms are they found?" one may ask. Solid food exists in the desire
realm, but not in the realms above it, for it is just those beings who have freed
themselves of desire for solid food who are born in these upper realms.

Someone may ask how there can be any solid food in the great hells. And yet
there is, for it is said that flaming iron balls and molten copper are forced into
the mouths of the beings living in these hells. Moreover we can understand
from the accounts of Gendun Sung and Shrona that in the partial and adjacent
hells there are kinds of food resembling those of the human realm.

Some may object that this explanation seems to contradict the following words
of the Treatise:
What is solid food? Any portion of a substance which, when
used as food, nurtures the various powers, and supports and
promotes the development of the major elements of the body.
Yet there is no contradiction. This explanation was given only with reference
to food as part of a nurturing process; iron balls or the like can be said to
satisfy the definition of food in that they do exhibit the ability to remove a
feeling of hunger.

"You have mentioned," one may begin, "sustenance consisting of contact, and
so on. Just what is the nature of each of these types of sustenance?" Contact,
mental movement, and consciousness that come with stain are each a kind of
sustenance. In their unstained form they can't be called sustenance, for
sustenance is defined by its function of perpetuating this suffering life, whereas
the stainless act to bring it to a stop. As sutra says,
It functions to keep alive those beings who have already come
out, and to nourish them; it functions to provide aid to those still
in the state of seeking their next life.

Sixteen extra, adjacent hells come with each of the entire eight, standing
around them in a circular arrangement. At each of their four individual
quarters we find then first a hell by the name of Embers. These embers reach
up to one's knees: when he sets his foot down, all the flesh and bone of his leg
are burned away. When he raises his foot again, it all grows back.

Next is the Corpse Rot, a swamp hell of rotten corpses. You sink down to
your waist and out come creatures called Sharpbeaks, with white bodies and
black heads, to spear your body. Right up against the Swamp is the Razor-
Studded Road, where again the flesh and bone of your feet are sliced away as
you set your feet down, constantly regenerating as you raise them again.

"The rest" refers first to the Forest of Swords, where the leaves of the trees are
actually swords. A breeze blows through the forest and stirs the sword-leaves,
which fall and lacerate your body. Great speckled dogs live in the forest and
attack, tearing the flesh away with fangs of iron. Terror drives you to the
Wood of Shalmali.

The shalmali are huge trees with trunks many miles in height, covered with
spines some sixteen inches long. As you climb a tree to escape the dogs, its
spines point downwards and stick into your body. When you reach the top,
ravens with steel beaks are waiting to pluck your eyeballs away from the
sockets. In desperation you begin to climb back down, only now the spikes
turn their points upward to spear your body again.

Last comes the River Uncrossable, filled with burning ashes and almost
impossible to pass. Now the three hells of the previous paragraphs are
counted only as one because the instruments of torture in each of them are of
the same general type. The dogs and ravens are considered characteristics of
the Forest of Swords and the Shalmali Wood.

In front of these hells stand the hellguards of the Lord of Death, weapons in
hand to stop any of the hellbeings from running somewhere else. One may
ask whether these guards are a kind of living being or not. The Sutrists claim
that they are not, that they are merely constructs of the elements and their
derivatives, like mountains that resemble the head of a goat or sheep.

Some might say that this explanation seems to contradict a verse from the
venerable Dharmika Subhuti:
Those who delight in anger, cruelty,
Those who find their pleasure in bad deeds,

And yet it does not. Here the expression "demons of Lord Death" is meant to
refer only to those craving spirits who act as attendants to the Lord of All
Things, the Lord of Death, and whose job it is to lead beings to their places in
the hells.

The Detailists on their part claim that the hellguards are a kind of living being,
and that after their deaths they take birth as hellbeings themselves, this being
the ripened result of their having done such harm to the beings in the hells.
They say the reason why the guards themselves are left unharmed by the
hellfires and so on is that their past deeds prevent it.

There are eight more hells, other than the hot ones. These are the cold hells,
and they start with the hell called Blisters. The names of the eight are Blisters,
Blisters Bursting, Chattering, Moaning in Cold, Screaming in Cold, Splitting

fit under this one continent. And yet they do, for the continents are all much
wider at the base, shaped like a pile of grain.

Now the principal habitat for animals is supplied by the Great Outer Sea: their
numbers here are great, their suffering limitless. Those that live in the lands
of men and pleasure beings are spread all over, with no one particular location.
The main place for craving spirits lies beneath the area of Rajagirha here on
our continent, some five hundred yojana [about 2,250 miles] deep. Here lives

the Lord of Death, known also as the Lord of All Things. He has the body of
a craving spirit, for the past deeds that have thrown him into this place were
non-virtuous. The deeds that determined the finishing details of his life,
though, were virtuous--so he enjoys a kind of eminence, like one of the greater
pleasure beings.

His job is to inform beings who are headed for the hells, those who are
ignorant of why they must go there, just what they did to deserve such a birth.
He is attended by some thirty-six types of craving spirits. These spirits may,
in general, be divided into three different groups: those with outer obstacles,
those with inner obstacles, and those with obstacles in the very nature of what
they try to eat or drink. Such spirits who live in the lands of men or pleasure
beings have no particular place, and are found throughout these areas.

Having thus discussed places where beings in the births of misery live, we turn
to the locations of those in the higher births. Since we have already described
the places where humans live, we begin with the lands of the pleasure beings.
These fall into two types: those actually related to an area of solid ground, and
those not so related. In the first category fall the lands of those in the class of
the Four Great Kings, as well as those of the Thirty-Three. Pleasure beings in
the class of the Four Great Kings may themselves be divided into those of the
mansions, and those of the mountains.

The Eon of Destruction

,BSKAL PA RNAM PA MANG BSHAD PA,
Many different types of eons are taught.
[III.358]

By way of introduction, we may say that many different types of eons are
taught. These include the eon of destruction, the eon of formation, the eon of
continuation, and the great eon.

GNYIS PA LA, 'JIG, 'CHAGS, GNAS, BSKAL PA CHEN PO'I,
Our detailed treatment of eons covers four topics, which correspond to the four
different types of eons just mentioned.

,'JIG PA'I BSKAL PA DMYAL BA YI,
,SRID PA MED NAS SNOD ZAD PA,
An eon of destruction from the point
Of no more hell births to the vessel's end.

"In the line above," one may begin, "you mentioned that `many different types
of eons are taught.' Can you now describe the `eon of destruction' and other
kinds of eons?" An "eon of destruction" starts from the point of where there
are no more beings taking births in the hell called "No Respite." And it lasts
up to the point where that great vessel, the outer world, has come to its end.
 , DE YANG MNAR MED DU SEMS CAN SKYE 'PHRO CHAD PA DANG , 'DZAM BU GLING PA'I MI RNAMS TSE LO BRGYAD KHRI BAR 'PHEL BA DANG , GNAS PA'I 'JUG RDZOGS PA DANG , 'JIG PA'I MGO RTZOM PA RNAMS DUS MNYAM,
Four different events then occur simultaneously: (1) the discontinuation of all
births by living beings into the hell of No Respite; (2) the increase of lifespans
among humans of Dzambu Continent up to eighty thousand years in length;
(3) the close of the eon of continuation, and (4) the opening of the eon of
destruction.

At this stage all the beings living in the hell of No Respite come to the end of
their lives--they die and move on. And even those who have collected new
karma that would normally bring them a rebirth in this same hell take their
birth instead in the hell on another planet. The same process follows for the
beings in the other hells, as well as for the animals and craving spirits living
in the depths of the seas. And the same thing happens, at the same time, with
the animals and craving spirits living in the lands of pleasure beings and
humans.

At this point one of the human beings living on Dzambu Continent
automatically attains the first concentration level. When he comes back out of
it, he exclaims: "Wonders! The bliss and pleasure that come from this deep
solitude are truly happiness!" Other inhabitants of the continent hear these
words, and then attain the first concentration level which is achieved
automatically. Subsequently they all take birth at the same level.

The very same process then occurs, in respective order, with the inhabitants of
the eastern continent and those of the continent to the west--Cattle Users. The
beings who live on the northern continent of Terrible Sound though possess a
special obstruction that has ripened from their past deeds, and are completely
incapable of ridding themselves of attachment for the kind of life they have.
Thus the process for them is that they first take rebirth as pleasure beings of
the desire realm.

The six classes of desire-realm pleasure beings each then go through the same
process, one by one. One of them attains the first concentration level
automatically. When he comes out of it, he exclaims: "Wonders! The bliss and
pleasure that come from this deep solitude are truly happiness!" Again the
others hear about it, and reach themselves the first concentration level achieved
through an automatic process. This leads them to take a birth into the level
known as "Class of the Pure."

Next one of the beings residing at the first concentration level achieves the
second concentration level, again through an automatic process. He comes out
of it and exclaims, "Wonders! The bliss and pleasure that come from single-

pointed concentration are truly happiness!" Still again the others hear about
it, and reach themselves the second concentration level achieved by an
automatic process. This brings about their birth at this second level.

The events described above go on for some nineteen intermediate eons. At this
point the great pleasure beings begin to stop sending rain at its proper time;
all the vegetation and forests of Dzambu Continent dry up and die. After an
extremely long period of time, a second sun rises in the sky, creating
tremendous heat. All the lesser bodies of water and small ponds turn dry.

This leads to the rising of a third sun, which causes all the streams and rivers
to evaporate. A fourth sun rises, and even the huge Lake Neverwarm
disappears. Then comes the fifth sun, drying the Great Outer Sea as well.
With the rising of a sixth sun, the four continents and Mount Supreme dissolve
in a cloud of smoke. Finally a seventh sun comes up, engulfing the world in
a single flame, destroying it in fire.

This fire then triggers a parallel fire in the first concentration level. The
mansions of this first level, empty of inhabitants by this time, are burned
completely. It is not actually the fire in the desire realm that burns down the
mansions here, for they are separate levels.

These last events require a single intermediate eon, which means that the
destruction of the world takes a total of twenty intermediate eons. The above
description, by the way, pertains to the destruction of a world by fire. In cases
where the planet is destroyed by water, beings living at the second
concentration level attain the third level of concentration by an automatic
process. This leads to their subsequent birth at the third level. In an instance
where the world is, finally, destroyed by wind, inhabitants of this third level
reach the fourth concentration level by an automatic process and then take
birth there.

Now an eon of formation begins from the rising of the first gentle wind on
up to the birth of a single living being within the hell of No Respite. At the
very beginning, space is completely empty--then a gentle wind rises, a portent
of the formation of a new planet. The force of this wind alone would never be
enough to create that great vessel, the outer world--although the levels from
Class of the Pure down to Free of Conflict do take shape.

This same wind from before then gathers strength over a period of a great
many years, until all the parts of the world from the foundation disc of wind
up to the land of the Thirty-Three have formed, one by one, working up from
the bottom. All these different events require one entire intermediate eon.

Next there is a certain being who was living at the level of Clear Light, and
whose life, merit, and power of past deeds have all run out. He takes a rebirth
into the empty mansion of the Pure One; for it is the nature of things, that
what was destroyed last is the first to take form. Then come all the other
inhabitants of the world, one by one, up to those of Dzambu Continent.

These first human beings to dwell on Dzambu Continent are born
instantaneously, all complete. For food they need nothing but the feeling of
bliss, and their bodies shine with a radiant light. They have miraculous
powers that allow them to fly in the sky, and live for an "inestimable" number
of years. This entire process, up to the point where a single living being takes
birth into the hell of No Respite, requires some nineteen intermediate eons.

Four different events then occur simultaneously: (1) a drop in the lifespan from
a "inestimable" number to eighty thousand years; (2) the birth of any single
being into the hell of No Respite; (3) the close of the formation eon; and (4) the
opening of the eon of continuation.

Now the length of an eon of continuation is twenty intermediate eons, with the
length of each intermediate eon figured as follows. One such eon consists of
the period during which average lifespans drop from an "inestimable" number
of years down to when the spans of life are only ten years. There are
eighteen other intermediate eons after that, each consisting of an increase in
lifespans up to eighty thousand years followed by a decrease back to ten. Last
of all is one intermediate eon which is another increase alone. How far is the
increase? Up until they're eighty thousand long.

One may make the following objection: "According to you then, the first and
final members of any such set of twenty intermediate eons represent only half
a curve apiece--whereas each of the eighteen between consist of full curves.
Wouldn't this imply a difference in the lengths of these different eons?" It does
not, for the first and final ones move along their half curves relatively slower,
while the eons in between these two move along their full curves relatively
faster.

One may begin with the following question: "It is explained that Buddhas come
from the act of accumulating merit and wisdom for a period of three
`countless' eons. Just what type of eons are referred to here?" A Buddha
occurs from the act of accumulating merit and wisdom for a period of three
"countless" numbers of these great eons.

Some may object that it is a contradiction of terms to speak of "three" that are
"countless." And yet it is not. Here we are not talking about the "countless"
that refers to something that is beyond numbers. Rather, what we call a
"countless" is the name of a specific number, the highest of our numbers with
separate names, corresponding to ten to the sixtieth power.

Now the present eon is also known as the "Eon of Good Fortune," the "Eon of

'JIG RTEN 'CHAGS PA'I CHU'I DKYIL 'KHOR GYI NANG DU GSER GYI PA 'DAB MA STONG DANG LDAN PA STONG BYUNG BA LA, GNAS GTZANG MA'I LHA RNAMS KYIS 'DI CI YIN SNYAM DU BRTAGS PAS, SANGS RGYAS STONG 'BYUNG BA'I SNGA LTAS SU SHES NAS, KYE MA BSKAL PA 'DI LA SANGS RGYAS STONG 'BYUNG BAS NA, BSKAL PA 'DI NI BSKAL BA BZANG PO'O ZHES BSGRAGS PAS, BSKAL PA BZANG PO ZHES GRAGS SO,
During the formation of the world, a thousand lotus blossoms of
gold with a thousand petals each appear within the great disc of
water. They pique the curiosity of the pleasure beings of the
Pure Places, who investigate the phenomenon and come to learn
that it portends the appearance of a thousand Buddhas.
"Wonders!" they proclaim, "a thousand different Buddhas are to
come--this eon is truly an eon of good fortune!" Thus it is that
everyone calls this time the "Eon of Good Fortune."

,DUS NAM GYI TSE 'BYUNG NA, YAR 'PHEL GYI TSE MI 'BYUNG STE, DE'I TSE SEMS CAN RNAMS 'KHOR BA LA SKYO SHAS CHUNG BA'I PHYIR, BRGYAD KHRI NAS MAR 'GRIB PA'I MGO RTZOM PA NAS, TSE LO BRGYA PA'I BAR LA SANGS RGYAS DE DAG 'BYUNG LA,
One may ask just when it is that Buddhas like this appear. They never come
while the average lifespan is rising, for during this period beings feel less
disgust with the circle of life. Rather, they--these Buddhas--make their
appearance during the time that starts from the drop of lifespans from eighty
thousand years, and which continues as they go down, until a hundred years
is reached.

DE MAN CHAD DU MI 'BYUNG STE, SNYIGS MA LNGA HA CANG YANG BDO BA SHAS CHE BAS CHOS BSTAN PA'I SNOD DU MI RUNG BA'I PHYIR,
Buddhas do not appear subsequent to this period, as lifespans are decreasing
even further. Since the five degenerations have spread fairly widely by this
time, beings then are no fit vessels to receive the teachings.

The Contemplation on Death
The following selections are taken from the Great Book on the Steps of the Path
(Lamrim Chenmo), by Je Tsongkapa (1357-1419).

The second part, the instruction on how to get the very essence out of life,
includes three different sections: the teaching on how to train one's mind in the
steps of the path that are shared with those of lesser scope; the teaching on
how to train one's mind in the steps of the path that are shared with those of
medium scope; and the teaching on how to train one's mind in the steps of the
path for those of greater scope.

The first of these three sections has three divisions of its own: the actual
teaching for training one's mind in the attitude of a person of lesser scope; how
to know when you have succeeded in reaching this attitude; and clearing up
some misconceptions about the attitude. The first of these divisions has two
parts: learning to develop the attitude of focussing on the life hereafter; and
learning to make use of the various ways of achieving happiness in these
future lives.

,DANG PO LA GNYIS, 'JIG RTEN 'DIR RING DU MI GNAS PA 'CHI BA RJES SU DRAN PA BSAM PA DANG , 'JIG RTEN PHYI MAR JI LTAR 'GYUR BA 'GRO BA GNYIS KYI BDE SDUG 
BSAM PA'O,
We will cover the subject of focusing on the life after death in two stages. The
first is the contemplation of how to maintain an awareness of death; that is, the
fact that we have not long to stay in this present world. The second is the
contemplation of the relative happiness and pain of the two broad categories
of living beings; that is, the question of what will happen to us when we reach
our future life.

,DANG PO LA BZHI, 'CHI BA DRAN PA MA BSGOMS PA'I NYES DMIGS, BSGOM PA'I PHAN YON, 'CHI BA DRAN PA'I BLO JI LTA BU ZHIG BSKYED PA, 'CHI BA DRAN PA BSGOM PA'I TSUL LO,
There are four steps to the contemplation of death. These are:
1) Considering the problems of not meditating on death.
2) Considering the benefits of meditating on death.
3) Identifying just what kind of death awareness we seek to develop.
4) How to meditate and develop this awareness of death.

,DANG PO NI, DE LTAR DAL BA'I RTEN LA SNYING PO LEN PA LA 'JUG PA LA PHYIN CI LOG BZHI LAS, MI RTAG PA LA RTAG PAR 'DZIN PA'I PHYIN CI LOG NYID DANG POR GNOD PA'I SGOR 'GYUR RO,
Here is the first of the four. Above we spoke of getting the very essence out
of this life, where now you have a whole range spiritual opportunities. The
one thing that could damage your ability to do so, from the very beginning, is
the first of what we call the "four misconceptions." This is the misconception
where you grasp to impermanent things as being permanent.

,DE LA PHRA RAGS GNYIS LAS RAGS PA'I MI RTAG PA 'CHI BA LA MI 'CHI SNYAM PA'I RNAM PAR RTOG PA NYID GNOD PA'I SGO'O, , 'DI LA YANG DA GZOD MTHAR 'CHI BA ZHIG 'ONG SNYAM PA NI KUN LA YOD KYANG NYI MA RE RE BZHIN DE RING MI 'CHI, DE RING YANG MI 'CHI 
SNYAM DU BLOS MI 'CHI BA'I PHYOGS 'DZIN PA NI 'CHI KHA MA TSUN LA 'BYUNG NGO ,
There are two versions to this wrong idea. One is more subtle, and one is
more gross. The one that could damage your practice is the grosser one, where
you look upon your own impermanence, your own mortality, and imagine for
some reason that you are not going to die.
Now it is true that in your life up to now you have had some awareness that
eventually you would have to die. Everybody has this kind of death
awareness. But at the same time you tend to be of the opinion that you won't
die, because with every day that passes you say to yourself, "It won't be today,
today is not the day that I will die." And you keep this attitude all the way up
to the moment of your death.

,DE'I GNYEN PO YID LA MA BYAS PAR DE LTA BU'I BLO DES BSGRIBS NA TSE 'DIR SDOD PA'I BLO SKYES NAS DE'I RING LA 'DI DANG 'DI DGOS SO ZHES TSE 'DI TZAM GYI BDE BA BSGRUB PA DANG SDUG BSNGAL SEL BA'I THABS 'BA' ZHIG LA SEMS SEMS NAS, 'JIG RTEN PHYI MA DANG THAR PA DANG THAMS CAD MKHYEN PA LA SOGS PA'I DON CHEN PO DAG LA RNAM PAR DPYOD PA'I BLO MI SKYE BAS CHOS LA 'JUG PA'I BLO SKYER MA STER LA,
Suppose you let this kind of attitude go on, suppose you fail to apply the
spiritual antidotes that would stop these sorts of thoughts. The thoughts then
create a kind of spiritual blindness: you begin to get the idea that you are
going to be able to stay here in this life, and then you start to obsess on this
life. All you can concentrate on then is how to get what you want, and how
to escape what you don't want, in this life. Your life becomes, "Today I need
this, and this, and next this."

And then even if--by some remote chance--you do engage in spiritual
activities like learning, or contemplation, or meditation, they all become
something you are doing only for this life. Whatever good deeds you do this
way are of very little strength. And because they are then typically connected

with some bad deed, some breaking of morality or transgression of a vow, it
is quite unusual to find any good activities of this type that are not interlaced
with the very causes that would take you to one of the births of misery.

Suppose even that you do decide to do something for your future life.
Without this awareness of death you find yourself unable to stop the kind of
laziness where you put your practice off, where you say to yourself, "I'll get to
it later, I'll do all these things eventually, one at a time." You begin to pass the
time of your life with all kinds of distractions: with sleep, or lazing around, or
wasted talk, or food or drink, or the like. You won't be able to reach a point
where the practice that you do has any great energy behind it.

This kind of hope that you will be able to live for a long time deceives you.
You start to have strong attachment to gain, to being honored by other people,
and the like. You begin to feel a strong dislike for anything that prevents you,
or anything that you think might prevent you, from having these things. There
grows in you a dark ignorance that cannot understand the problems these
thoughts then give you.
These lead to a steady torrent of mental afflictions, strong ones, and all the
different varieties of them, major and minor: pride, and jealousy, and all the
rest.

These afflictions in turn lead you to harmful deeds done in your acts, your
words, and your thoughts: deeds like the ten non-virtues, and the five
"immediate" deeds, and the five that are close to these, and giving up the
highest Dharma, and on and on. Every single day then deeds like these, of
tremendous power, capable of leading you to the sufferings of the three lower
realms and the like, will tend to increase, further and further.
The antidote for all these deeds is the nectar of the Dharma, spoken so true,
and the further you turn from it then the more tightly you strangle your
chances for the higher realms, and ultimate good. Death will rip away your
life, and the wrong deeds you have done will drag you to the lower realms, to
a fearful place of mighty and savage suffering, to the fires. And so I ask you,
where could you find any thought more disastrous for you than this idea, that
what is impermanent could be permanent?

The Benefits of Meditating on Death

Here secondly is the contemplation of the benefits of meditating upon your
death. Suppose on the other hand that you are able to develop a real
awareness of your mortality. You would then be like a person who knew he
or she were going to die within the next day or two.
If this person had even a feeble understanding of the Dharma, or of course
anything more than that, then he or she would quickly realize that none of
their loved ones, nor any of the things they owned or anything else, could go
on the journey with them. All their attachment to these things would stop.
The great majority of such people at this point would automatically start to feel
some desire to get the essence out of the life they had left to them, and they
would start to engage in acts such as charity and the like.

You now should be the same. Think of the gain and honor, the fame and other
such things you hope for from others--all these worldly hopes and dreams.
Try to see that all the efforts you put into these things are empty, meaningless,
like useless shells of wheat once the grain has been taken out. Try to
understand how these thoughts deceive you, how they wait to snare and trap
you. Stop all your bad deeds.
Exert yourself now in the opposite--in good deeds, such as going for refuge,
and observing an ethical way of life, and the like. Amass these kinds of deeds
constantly, and with a sense of reverence and joy. This body and the rest may
be meaningless, but you can give them the highest meaning; you can use them

to climb to the highest state there is, and then you can lead others there as
well. And then I would ask you another question: Where could you find any
more important deed you could do, than this?

The Anthology too states,
Come to see that this body of yours
is fragile as a piece of china,
And that all other things that exist
are something similar to a mirage.
If you can, then the rain of spears
thrown by the demons, the flowers,
Are stopped short, and the Lord of Death
hungering for you dies himself.

It says as well that,
Those who have seen what it is to grow old,
who have seen the suffering of disease,
Those who have seen what it is to die,
who have seen the mind depart and leave,
They can give up the family life,
so much like a prison hard and fast;
Don't ever dream though that normal people
of the world could ever give up desire.

To put it briefly, the time for a person to do something of value is now, and
only now--now while we possess a body and life like this, so full of spiritual
leisure. You and I have spent most of our time in the births of misery, and we
come up now and again to the better births; but the vast majority of the time
was in the realms where we had none of the necessary opportunities, and so
we had no chance at all to undertake any spiritual practice.
And the fact that in this moment here, when we have found the kind of life
where we could do some practice, we nonetheless do nothing the way it
should be done, is all in the final analysis due to our belief that we will not
die, just yet. We can say then that our natural bias towards thinking that we
won't die is the root of every trouble we have. The antidote for this way of
thinking--that is, to stay aware of our imminent death--is then the root of
anything good that could ever come to us.

This being the case, you should never let yourself think, "This is one of those
practices meant for people who have nothing more profound to meditate
upon." And you should never let yourself think that, "It is admittedly
something we should meditate upon, but only at the beginning of our practice,
and only for a bit at that; it's not something that warrants a continual effort to
put into practice." Rather you should try to develop a true understanding,

from the depths of your heart, where you realize that this is a meditation
which you need at the start, at the end, and all throughout the path. With this
understanding established within you then, you must meditate upon your
death.

What Death Awareness Really Is

,GSUM PA 'CHI BA DRAN PA'I BLO JI LTA BU ZHIG BSKYED PA NI, GNYEN LA SOGS PA LA CHAGS PA BRTAN PA'I DBANG GIS DE DAG DANG BRAL GYIS DOGS NAS SKRAG PA SKYE BA NI LAM LA YE MA SBYANGS PA'I 'CHI BA LA SKRAG LUGS YIN PAS 'DIR DE BSKYED PA NI MIN NO,
Here now is the third step--identifying just what kind of death awareness we
seek to develop. Now there is a kind of terror that a person can feel when he
or she fears that they are about to be torn away from their loved ones and
such. This fear stems from a very strong attachment for those around you, and
is the natural fear of a person who has never attempted any kind of practice
of the path. As such, it is not the awareness of death that we are talking about
having to develop here.

,'O NA GANG YIN SNYAM NA, LAS DANG NYON MONGS PA'I DBANG GIS LUS BLANGS PA THAMS CAD NGES PAR 'CHI BA LAS MA 'DAS PAS DE LA SKRAG PA BSKYED KYANG RE ZHIG LA DGAG MI NUS MOD, 'ON KYANG 'JIG RTEN PHYI MA'I DON NGAN 'GRO'I RGYU 'GOG PA DANG MNGON MTHO DANG NGES LEGS KYI RGYU MA BSGRUBS PAR 'CHI BA LA 'JIGS PAR BYA STE,
What then is this awareness? There is not a single being who has taken on a
body like ours--one created by the force of our past deeds and mental
afflictions--who is exempt from the absolute certainty of death. It is true that,
in the short run, trying to develop some fear about this fact might not enable
you to stop it. Nonetheless you really must try to develop some fear that you
might die before you have been able to achieve your goals for your future life:
that you might die before you have managed to put an end to anything that
might cause you to be born in one of the lower realms, or before you have
achieved all those things that would lead you to the higher realms, and to
ultimate good.

If you had this kind of fear, over these kinds of things, then it would help you
to do something about them, and at the moment of death itself you would
have no reason to be afraid. If on the other hand you find yourself unable to
achieve these goals, then when death comes you will be tormented by regret,
of two different kinds. In a general sense, you will realize that you were
unable to free yourself from the circle of suffering life. More specifically, you
will begin to feel sheer terror over the possibility of having to drop into the
realms of misery. As the Birth Stories say,
You concentrate your every effort,
but there's no way to stay;
What possible benefit can it be
to feel a sense of fear
And tremble over something that
you can now never repair?
You can tell yourself by looking at
the nature of this world,
That those who did bad deeds are at
this point consumed by regret;

They realize then that they didn't at all
do good the way they should,
And begin to suspect that in the life
beyond they will come to suffer.
The fear that you begin to feel
as you die confuses you,
Making it difficult to recall
the very deeds there were
That you did before, and that you feel
such strong regret for doing.
So make it now a habit in your life
to undertake those deeds that are pure white;
For where would you ever find a person who,
living the Dharma, still needs fear Lord Death?

The Four Hundred too has the following verse:
Anyone who's truly sure,
Who says to themselves, "I'll die,"
Leaves every kind of fear behind;
How could they then fear Death?

,DES NA LUS DANG LONGS SPYOD DANG MYUR DU 'BRAL BAR GDON MI ZA'O SNYAM DU YANG DANG YANG DU MI RTAG PA BSAMS NA NI, DE DAG LA MI 'BRAL BAR RE BA'I SRED PA LDOG PAS DE DAG DANG BRAL BAS BSKYED PA'I YID KYI GDUNG BA'I DBANG GIS 'CHI BA LA SKRAG PA MI 'BYUNG BA YIN NO,
Suppose then that you are able to contemplate your impermanence, and think
to yourself, over and over again, "There is absolutely no doubt that I am
quickly going to be ripped away from my body, and from all of my
possessions." This would allow you to block the kind of desire that still
entertains some hope that you will be able to avoid losing all these things.

And then you would feel none of the fear of death that comes when your mind
is tormented by the thought of this loss.

The Meditation on Death

Next we cover the fourth step, which is how to meditate and develop this
awareness of death. You should do the meditation in three stages, going
through the three principles, the nine reasons, and the three resolutions. We
will proceed then through the three of (a) contemplating how it is certain that
we will die; (b) contemplating how there is no certainty when we will die; and
(c) contemplating how, when we do die, nothing but the Dharma can be of any
help to us.

Nothing Can Stop Death

The first of these has three parts; here is the first, which is (1) contemplating
how the Lord of Death must certainly arrive and, when he does, how nothing
at all can stop him.

No matter what kind of body you take on yourself, death must come to you.
As the Anthology on Impermanence states,
If total Buddhas, and self-made Buddhas as well,
And the listeners who are the followers of the Buddha,
All must eventually leave their holy forms,
Why should we need then speak of normal people?

,YUL GANG DU BSDAD KYANG 'CHI BA 'ONG BA NI, DE NYID LAS, GANG DU GNAS NA 'CHI BAS MI TSUGS PA'I, , SA PHYOGS DE NI YOD PA MA YIN TE, , BAR SNANG LA MED RGYA MTSO'I NANG NA MED, , RI BO RNAMS KYI GSEB TU ZHUGS NA'ANG MIN, , ZHES SO,
We can say too that death will come to you, no matter where you go. The
same text says,
It doesn't matter where you go; the place does not exist
Where death would find it difficult to intrude.
There is no such place in the sky, nor at the bottom
Of the sea, nor deep within a mountain keep.

So too death makes no distinction at all for the proper order of young and old
when it comes to destroy its victims. On this the same work says,
Those who are now, and those who are yet to be,
All must give up this body, and travel on.
Realize, you wise ones, that all this dies;
Live the Dharma, and do what must be done.

by outrunning him, nor turn him back with magic words or the like. As the
scripture known as Advice to the King states,
Suppose for example that you were surrounded on all four sides
by four great mountains, solid, firm, hard to the core,
indestructible, unbreakable, indomitable, adamantine and
massive, stretching to the highest limits of the sky. And then
suppose suddenly that they caved in on you. Every trace of
vegetation--from the roots, to the stalks, to the branches, to the
twigs, and out to the leaves, would be crushed to powder. And
every living creature there, every sentient being, every spirit too,
would be smashed to dust. And as the mountains fell in it
would happen in a minute, and no one would be able to outrun
them, or force them back, or buy them off. Nor but with the
greatest difficulty could you use any kind of magic substance, or
magic words, or any sort of elixir to stop them.

Here, great King, our life is the same. When the four great
terrors make their appearance, no one can outrun them, nor force
them back, nor buy them off. Nor but with the greatest difficulty
could you use any kind of magic substance, or magic words, or
any sort of elixir to stop them.

And what are these four terrors? They are aging, and sickness,
and death, and trouble. Great King, I say to you: aging is the
fact that our vitality is inevitably obliterated; sickness is the fact
that our health is inevitably obliterated; trouble is the fact that
any good thing that ever comes to us is inevitably obliterated;
and death is the fact that our very life is inevitably obliterated.
All four of these come to us, and we cannot outrun them, nor
force them back, nor buy them off. Nor but with the greatest
difficulty could you use any kind of magic substance, or magic
words, or any sort of elixir to stop them.

Kamawa too once said,
A person is supposed to be frightened of death now, and then
unperturbed when it actually comes. You and me though act the
opposite: we feel no concern for it now, and then when it
actually comes we will tear at our chest in agony.

The second reason here is (2) the contemplation of how it is impossible to add
any time onto your life, and how it continually leaks away, without a pause.
The scripture entitled Entering the Womb describes the longest you could live
as follows:
Nowadays the longest you can live, supposing you are able to
take care of yourself in the very best way possible, is a hundred
years, or a touch more.

Even if you could live for a hundred years, the time would pass very quickly.
This is because years pass in months, and months in their turn pass in days,
and days pass in daytimes and nighttimes. These too pass in the shortest
periods, of mornings and evenings and the like. So a human lifespan in
general is something which is very short.

You and I can see for ourselves, moreover, that we've already used up a good
number of these days. As for the days we have left, we know we are helpless
to add a single moment to them. They leak away, twenty-four hours a day,
without the slightest pause. On this the Guide to the Bodhisattva's Life says,
Our lifetime constantly leaks away,
Day and night, without a moment's pause.
If your life is leaking away, and never being replenished,
Then how can you imagine, that you will never die?

There are many examples you can use during your contemplation of these
points. Think of weaving a carpet: you are building it up with rows of yarn,
and each row is nothing more than a few threads of wool. But if you work
steadily, it all adds up and soon you've finished an entire carpet.
Think too of a flock of sheep. When they are led to the slaughter house, they
go forth with only one very short step at a time. But every single step brings
them inexorably nearer to their death.
Think too of the rapids of a great river, or of a waterfall as it leaps from the
top of a high cliff. The moments of your life are rushing away, just the same.

A cowherd takes a club up in his hand and drives the cattle, totally helpless,
to their destination. Just so do sickness and the natural aging of our bodies
drive us, totally helpless, into the presence of the Lord of Death. You must use
a whole variety of such examples in your meditation upon death; as the
Anthology again says,
When for example you start to weave a carpet,
You build it up, a string of wool at a time--
Eventually then you weave it to the end.
Human lives are just the same.
Those condemned to death are another example,
Passing along with a single step at a time,
Drawing ever closer to the slaughter.
Human lives are just the same.
The rapids of a mighty river
Rush unstoppable to their end;
The passing of a human life
Is just as irreversible.
Our lives are simple hardship, short,
And something full of suffering;
In simple speed we are all destroyed,
Letters written with a stick on water.

A cowherd for example grasps a staff,
Then drives the cattle to their destination.
Just so sickness and the ravages of age
Transport us to the presence of Lord Death.

They say as well that the great Lord Atisha would go to the edge of a stream
and meditate there on the death; he would comment that "Sitting here and
watching a trickle of water pass by is a wonderful way to meditate on life's
impermanence." The Sutra of the Cosmic Play uses a lot of similes as well:
The three realms are impermanent,
like a cloud in the autumn sky;
Watching as people are born and die
is the same as theater.
The passing of a person's life
is a single flash of lightning;
We rush on our way to the end with speed,
like a waterfall off a cliff.

It has been said that, "For a person who has the least bit of ability to reflect
and draw some inferences on the inside, there is nothing outside of them that
doesn't speak of impermanence." As such, you should try to find in your life
a whole variety of examples for the fact of impermanence. Use these examples
for your contemplation--and when you have contemplated thus on a regular
basis, you will gain a true recognition of your impermanence. Just thinking
these things over once or twice is not enough to reach this recognition. As
Kamawa once said,
Here's a question for all you people who say you tried to do this
contemplation but didn't get any result from it. Just when was it
that you were contemplating? All day long you were distracted
by other things. At night all you did was sleep. Perhaps you
should stop lying to yourself.

At the end of our life, the Lord of Death comes and destroys us, and we travel
on to our next life. But there is something else too that happens all during the
interim, during every hour of our life here. There is not a single moment at
all when our lifetime is not slipping away, when it is not getting shorter and
shorter, even as we go somewhere, or stay somewhere, waking or sleeping.
So in a sense we are always on our way to our next life, we are travelling there
now, and we have been on the move every second from the day we first
entered our mother's womb.
Therefore even in these days, while we still live, we are living only to die:
those emissaries of death, the ones called Sickness and Aging, are dragging us

towards him. Don't take any comfort then in the fact that you haven't died
yet, don't get the idea that you are staying anywhere, and that you haven't yet
started off on your journey to the next life. You are like a man who just fell
off the edge of a great rock crag; you would be foolish to take some comfort
from the fact that you are still in mid-air, and haven't hit ground yet.

The following lines too are quoted in the commentary on The Four Hundred:
This warrior amongst men, from the very first night,
From the moment of entering the womb in this world
Walks with each passing day, with ne'er a delay,
Into the presence of the Lord of Death.

The Words on Stopping the Four Misconceptions also speak to this point:
Suppose you had fallen from the peak
of some high mountain top,
And were just about to die--would you then
in the free-fall feel content?
From the moment of their birth they race
to one goal only, death;
How before they reach there then
could any living being relax?
All of the above is meant to show how it is certain that we will die quickly.

Next is contemplating (3) how certain it is that you will die without having
had any time to practice the Dharma, even while you were alive. Suppose you
were able to live to the end of one of those longest lives that we described
above. Even so it would be wrong to think that you would have any free time
all that time. So far in your life you have squandered a great deal of time
meaninglessly; as for what remains, you will pass half of it in sleeping.
The other half you will also spend meaninglessly, your mind filled with a great
many other distractions. You will while away you days of good health and
then arrive at old age, you body and mind worn out, and lacking any energy
to do any Dharma, even if you wanted to. The point is that the window of
opportunity during which we can undertake our spiritual practice is nothing
more than a very brief period. As Entering the Womb relates,
You spend half of it wrapped in sleep. Ten years is wasted by
childhood, and another twenty in old age. From what's left you

have to subtract the time you spend in grief, and the time you
spend crying in anguish, and the time you spend in physical
pain, and the time you spend in deep unhappiness, and the time
you spend in strife. Subtract too the time that you spend going
through all those thousands of different diseases which the body
is subject to.

The Words on Stopping the Four Misconceptions concur:
Suppose you live to a human's longest life;
it can never be more than a hundred years.
Of these you spend the beginning, your youth,
and the end, old age, in a meaningless way.
In the days that are left, all your hopes and plans
are smashed by sleep, and disease, and the rest;
Tell me then how much time is left over, for those
who live as humans, to feel any kind of contentment?
Chekawa too has said,
I have been alive for sixty years; and if you take away the time that I
spent feeding myself, and sleeping, and being sick, there were not even
five years left that I had for spiritual practice.

And so all the good things of this life are like the happiness within one night's
dream: you wake, and then it's nothing more than a memory. The time comes
to die, and everything good you ever had lives only in a dim remembrance.
This great enemy, death, will surely come; nothing can stop him. You should
contemplate this fact--try to wonder, "Why do I take such pleasure in the lie
of this life?" Make up your mind that you absolutely must now practice some
Dharma; swear it to yourself, continually. Remember the Birth Stories, where
it says:
Alas, you worldly ones so full of affliction of the mind;
Why do you take such pleasure in a land of shifting sands?
The shining glory of the kumuda bloom, opening to the moon,
Soon enough turns nothing more than a simple memory.
It's something of a pure amazement too that all of us
Thrust into a life like this are not consumed by total fear;
Damn the Lord of Death, who stands and blocks all pathways out,
While we oblivious feel content, and have an enjoyable day.
We all share enemies, dreadfully powerful, ones we cannot stop:
Their names are sickness, age, and death; they attack us even now.
If it's certain that we are headed for agony in the world beyond,
How could anyone with a mind be content in the one here now?

Go now and contemplate these lines, from the Epistle of Kanika:
The Lord of Death, the heartless one,
Lays waste to the efforts of a lifetime;
With such a death on its way to him,
What man of wisdom would sit and wait?
This merciless warrior stands and aims
His detestable merciless arrow at you;
In the time before he lets it fly then
Try to make something of your life.

Here next is the second of the three principles: contemplating how there is no
certainty when we will die. It is an absolute certainty that death will come to
us at some point between today and a hundred years from now. It is not
certain though which day between these two he will choose. As such, we
would have to admit that it's impossible to come to a definite conclusion
whether or not we will die, for example, today itself.
Nonetheless, if you are going to try to think more on the mortal side, then you
will have to develop the attitude that you will die today. If you tend to think
more on the side that denies your mortality--that is, if you tend to think that
you won't die today, or that you probably won't die today--then you will
constantly be acting on the assumption that you will continue to be here, rather
than doing something to help your future life. Right in the middle of
everything then the Lord of Death will come to take you, and you will have
to die in anguish.

If you spend every day getting ready to die, you will find yourself able to
achieve many goals that relate to your future lives. This is an excellent thing
to do regardless of whether you actually die that day or not. And it is an
absolute necessity if you do happen to die that very day.
This truth can be illustrated with the following example. Suppose you have
a sworn enemy, a very powerful one, and that he is planning to make some
vicious attack on you. Suppose too that the general timeframe for this attack
has been decided: you know that he is going to come for you sometime
between this date and that date. You're not sure exactly which day he's going
to appear, but you would certainly have to be on your guard every single day.
The case with our death is exactly the same.

Suppose you are able to develop this attitude where you believe that you are
going to die today, or at least that it is very likely that you will die today. The
result is that you will start getting things ready for what is surely going to
come--that is, for your next life--and you will stop concentrating on arranging
things in your current life.
If you are unable to develop this attitude, then you will continue to believe
somehow that you are going to be staying here in the present life, and you will
continue to concentrate on organizing things for this life. You will continue
too to ignore what's needed for your future life.
If for example you believe that you are going to be living in a certain house for
a long time to come, you concentrate your time on making the house a nice
place to live. If one the other hand you believe that you are moving to another
house, if you believe that you will not be staying in the house where you are,
then you naturally begin to concentrate on getting everything ready for the
place you're going to go. Again, our case is just the same.
This proves that you must develop the attitude that you are going to die today,
every day.

There is No Such Thing as an "Average" Lifespan

There are three reasons to prove this second principle, that there is absolutely
no certainty when you are going to die. The first is the contemplation that (4)
here on the continent of Dzambu, lifetimes are anything but fixed. Looking at
things in a broad way, we can say that the length of a life on the continent of
Unpleasant Sound is something which is fixed. And although on the other
continents the span of life is not fixed, there are many cases where a certain
length of life is normally the case.
Here on the continent of Dzambu though a person's life is anything but fixed.
There are times at the beginning of the world when people can live up to an
"inestimable" number of years. Eventually though there comes a time when
the the longest life we can point to is only ten years. Even nowadays we can
see with our own eyes how indefinite lifetimes can be, as death comes for the
old, and the young, and those inbetween, at random.

As the Treasure House says,
Here indefinite: at the very end,
Ten years; at the beginning "inestimable."
The Anthology too states,
In the morning a lot of people were standing here;
By evening some of them were missing.
In the evening a lot of people were standing here;
By morning some of them were missing.
So too it says,
We see men die, we see women die,
We see those in the bloom of health die;
So how on earth could you point to someone
And say, "He's young, he'll certainly live."
Some people die still in the womb,
Some people die in the moment of birth,
Some people die standing still,
Some people die on the run.
Some are old, some are young,
Some are strong ones in between,
They walk and then drop, in a steady stream,
Like ripe fruit falling from a tree.
Think of great lamas you've known, or friends, or anyone--the people that
you've seen yourself, or heard about from others--who died before their time.
Something on the outside, or something on the inside of them, came and killed
them suddenly, before they were able to do all the things they were hoping to
do.
You must think to yourself, "I'm in exactly the same situation now that they
were in when they died..." Try to think this truth over again and again; try
your best to reach this realization of your death.

The Things than Can Kill You are Infinite

Next is the contemplation that (5) the things that can kill you are very, very
many; whereas the things that can keep you alive are very few. There are
many things that threaten the kind of life we live: threats that are living beings,
and threats that are inanimate objects. Humans and inhumans, beings of the
spirit realm, do harm to us in many different ways. Beings of the animal realm
threaten our body and life in a variety of ways as well.
You have to try to contemplate thoroughly all the ways in which these living
things can hurt you; and how too that inner things like sickness, and outer
things made of the various physical elements, attack you constantly.

Moreover, your body consists by necessity of the four elements. Their nature
is to be in conflict with each other, which causes the energies of the four to fall
out of balance, some asserting themselves too strongly, and some becoming too
weak. This situation triggers then illness within the body, and this eventually
rips out your life. And so in a way you are under attack by the components
of your own body. Since these elements are a very part of you, life is by
nature a very fragile thing.

The Sutra of the Great Nirvana says as well,
And then there is the conception of death: see your life as
standing there, surrounded all the time by a mass of hate-filled
enemies, life leaking away with every moment, and no hope at
all of ever filling back what was lost.

The String of Jewels also states,
The tools of Lord Death are the very world around us;
Our lives are candles standing in a tempest.
The Letter to a Friend mentions,
Our lives are filled with danger, and we are more fragile
Than a bubble of water swept along in the wind.
The fact that we live long enough to exhale after inhaling,
Or wake again from a night of sleep, is truly a miracle.

The Four Hundred again says,
Alone they have no power to give us birth;
Only as a group can the elements in us work.
It would be totally wrong for a person to say
That this inner war could ever feel good.

These are the days when the five degenerations have spread to a very great
extent, when it is infinitely difficult to find anyone who is capable of amassing
the powerful good karma necessary for producing any very long lifetime.
Food and other kinds of medicinal substances have little potency, and lack any
great power to stop diseases.
The general ability of the body to break down easily the things we eat and
drink, so that the great elements within the body can be properly nourished,
is declining. We find it difficult to digest these things, and even after they are
digested they have little beneficial effect on our bodies.
There is an additional problem caused by the fact that we are able to collect
only small quantities of good karmic energy, whereas we commit massive
amounts of bad deeds. These diminish greatly the power of practices such as
repeating a number of mantras, and so it is extremely difficult to use these
methods to lengthen our lifespan, and such.

Beyond all this is the fact that there is nothing at all that we use to keep
ourselves alive that cannot also turn into something that kills us. We spend
our lives searching for food and drink, or a place to stay, or friends or the like,
with the intent that they help keep us from dying.
But they can all turn into something that kills us instead. If we eat or drink
too much, or too little, or ingest something which is not clean or the like, it can
kill us. Our house can collapse on us, and our friends can cheat us, and they
can all in the end lead us to our deaths. You literally cannot find anything that
is supposed to keep you alive that cannot kill you as well.

Moreover, life itself is directed at dying; even if there were more objects that
were supposed to function to keep us alive, we could hardly put any faith in
them. As the String of Jewels says,
The things that can kill us are many;
Those that keep us alive are precious few,
And act as well to kill us.
We must as such do all the Dharma we can.

Our Bodies are So Fragile

Next is the contemplation that there is no certainty when we will die, for the
reason that (6) our bodies are extremely fragile. Our bodies really are very
fragile, very much like a bubble, and it requires no great injury to destroy our
life-force: even something like the prick of a thorn, if we disregard it, can kill
us. The point is that none of the things that can kill us has to try very hard to
kill us. The Letter to a Friend says,
Great edifices like the earth itself, and the mountain
At the center of the world, and the seas, all burn
When the seven suns rise, and not even dust remains.
Who needs to mention then that fragile thing called man?

Once you have taken this contemplation to its end, it will occur to you clearly
that there is no certainty at all when the Lord of Death will decide to come and
destroy your body and life. You will realize that you have no time left; and
then you must make many solemn vows to yourself, you must resolve to
practice the Dharma here and now. As the Epistle of Kanika states,
The Lord of Death is partial to no one;
When he strikes, he does so suddenly.

Don't ever say then you'll "Do it tomorrow";
Practice the Dharma instead with speed.
It's no good thing for a human being
Ever to say, "I'll do it tomorrow";
The tomorrow when you are no longer here
Is a day that beyond any doubt will come.

That lord of accomplished practitioners, Shri Jagata Mitra Ananda, has also
spoken:
The spirit lord will take this form you rent,
In health, in its prime, in an hour of contentment,
And rip away in this very moment its heart.
You sit there now unconcerned by disease or death,
By decline and the like, but when the day arrives
To meet them face to face you'll know nothing to do.
Of all the three principles, this one, the contemplation that it is totally
uncertain when you will die, is the most important. Since this attitude is the
critical one, you must do your best to grow it within you.

When You Die, Nothing but the Dharma Can Help You

Here finally are the three reasons behind the third principle, which is
that--when you do die--nothing but the Dharma can be of the least help to
you.
So we have seen that we will be forced to pass on to a future life. When the
day comes, you can be surrounded by any number of friends and relatives, by
people who love you and whose hearts are torn, but (7) there is not a single
one of them that you can take along with you. You can be the owner of a
great heap of lovely riches, any amount of them at all, but (8) you cannot carry
along with you a single molecule. When you die (9) you must give up even
the flesh and bone that are part of your very being; it's ridiculous to think then
that you could keep anything else.

We can say then that each and every good thing of this life will send us away,
and we too will send them away, and pass on to our next life: this is, simply,
quite certain to happen. You must contemplate how this is coming to you
today, and you must contemplate how, when the moment comes, it is only the
Dharma which will be your refuge, and your protector, and your one true
friend. As the Epistle of Kanika says,

The karma ripens, and all your deeds
From before abandon and leave you alone.
Driven by all the new karma now,
You're forced ahead by the Lord of Death.
Everyone you've ever known
Is left behind, and only the good
Or bad you've done comes with you.
Please understand, and do only things that are right.

It's just as Shri Jagata Mitra describes it:
Now matter how wealthy you are, Your Highness,
Once you die and slip to the world beyond,
It's like standing defeated in an empty desert--
Alone, without the Prince, without the Queen,
Without a stitch of clothing, without a friend,
Without a kingdom, without a country at all;
Solitary, single, not a trusted servant in sight.
To put it simply, how could you hope for more
In a land where you no longer own your own name?

Thus it is then that you must contemplate upon the awareness of your death:
the spiritual leisure you now possess is extremely valuable; it is extremely
difficult to find; and beyond its being so hard to find it is also extremely easy
to lose.
Suppose we fail even to attempt reaching something of ultimate benefit, for our
next life and beyond; suppose instead we spend all the time from now up to
the moment of our death in the pursuit of the things that make us feel good,
and in avoiding the things that cause us pain.
Common animals are more skilled at this endeavor than we could ever be; we
need to engage in some kind of activity that distinguishes us from beasts.
Otherwise achieving the kind of life in a higher birth that we enjoy now is
essentially the same as never having found it at all. As the Guide to the
Bodhisattva's Life puts it,
There are certain insignificant gains
That are not a difficult thing to attain
Even for a cow if he tries;
Yet there are those who suffer from karma
And waste this perfect leisure and fortune,
Achieved with such effort, on nothing more.

And so even though the awareness of your death may sometimes seem a
difficult thing to attain, you must still make great efforts to do so, for it is the
very foundation of the path. Potowa too has said,
My guiding lamp is nothing but this meditation on my own
impermanence. It helps me to clear away all my concern about
the things of this life--my friends and possessions and so
on--and realize that I will be flying away to my next life, alone,
with no one to come along with me. Then I am truly able to stop
my attachment to my current life, and maintain an intention
never to do anything which is against the Dharma. As long as
you find yourself unable to reach this state of mind, you will find
too that the road to each and every part of the teaching is shut
off to you.

Dolpa once stated,
You must along the way undertake practices to amass the energy
of good deeds, and to purify yourself of spiritual obstacles. So
too you must make supplication to the angels, and to your Lama.
If then you put all your heart into contemplating this attitude, if
you focus on it, you will be able to attain it. Things produced by
causes have a basic nature that they can never just stay the same,
and you will find that you can arrive at certain kinds of attitudes
that you thought you could never develop in a thousand years of
trying.

They say too that when someone would ask Kamawa if they could move on
to a new spiritual topic he would say, "Work again on the old one." When
they asked if he could finish up the old one, he would say, "There is no finish
to the old one." So if your mind can handle it, do the meditation as I have
described it above. If your mind cannot handle it, then try to absorb as many
of the nine reasons for the three principles as fits your capacity.
Meditate over and over on your death until you gain a complete disgust for
the activities of this life; until you can think of them like a man on his way to
the site of his execution, stopping to put on some fine jewelry.
The subjects of how to serve a spiritual guide, of the spiritual fortune and
leisure of this life, and of our impermanence are found throughout the
supreme form of speech, the word of the Buddha, and the commentaries upon
it. You must come to realize that these are instructions to be put into practice
at each point where they occur, and so you should actually undertake them at
each step.
If you do so, then you will be able to grasp the true intent of the victorious
Buddhas quite easily. You should apply this advice to each of the other
sections here as well.

The Asian Classics Institute
Course XVII: The Great Ideas of Buddhism, Part Two
Reading Seven: The Ethical Life, Part One
1
The Ethical Life Empowers You for Meditation and Wisdom
The first reading for this class comes from Je Tsongkapa's Epistle to Ngawang
Drakpa on the Occasion of the Ordination of the First Monks of Gyalrong. Master
Ngawang Drakpa, also known as Tsako Wonpo ("the friar of the lineage of the
Kings of Tsako"), was one of Je Tsongkapa's closest disciples. After he had
trained him in the Dharma, Je Tsongkapa sent Ngawang Drakpa to a distant
region in east Tibet, entrusted with the mission of establishing a number of
monasteries and training Buddhist monks.
The ensuing correspondence between the teacher and his faraway disciple has
provided us with several true classics of Buddhist thought, including the
following demonstration of the role of an ethical life in developing one's ability
to meditate and perceive emptiness. Another letter from Je Tsongkapa to
Ngawang Drakpa during this period contains the famous Three Principal Paths,
which along with the commentary of Pabongka Rinpoche has been translated
in the book The Principal Teachings of Buddhism. The introduction to this book
also contains more detail on Master Ngawang Drakpa's life, and his close
relationship to Je Tsongkapa.
Please note that the version of the letter available for translation contained a
number of printing errors that have been corrected to the best of our ability;
we hope to obtain another edition later for comparison.

Once you have realized this fact
you must rely on watchfulness
And awareness; constantly checking all three
of the gateways for any wrong deeds,
Depending as well on a sense of care
and propriety to control
With all your strength the wild horse
of the senses, seeking to keep
This steed from taking you to a path
that leads you all astray.
With this state of mind you'll be able to hold
your concentration perfectly
Fixed on any virtuous object
at your heart's content.
Thus is the ethical life commended
for perfect concentration.

This state of mind is totally free
of the dirt of broken morality,
And is never disturbed or distracted from
the object of goodness you choose;
Therefore suchness, the lack of a self,
is perfectly clear to it,
Just like the moon's reflection on water
undisturbed and crystal clear.

The Vows of Individual Freedom
The next selection is taken from the first part of Daymaker (Nyin-byed),
composed by Master Ngulchu Dharma Bhadra (1772-1851) as a commentary
to the Essence of the Ocean of Discipline ('Dul-ba rgya-mtso'i snying-po), a
summary of the vinaya teachings by Je Tsongkapa (1357-1419).

There is something which, if you rely on it,
Is the way to travel with ease to the city of freedom;
The supreme essence of the teachings of those Gone to Bliss:
It is that which is called "individual freedom."

The "something" in the root text refers to the very root of the Buddha's
teachings; that is, to the vows of individual freedom and the books on the code
of discipline which take these vows as their subject matter. Suppose you rely
on this: you take these vows of individual freedom, and you keep them well.
This then is the way, the staircase, for traveling with ease (without any great
difficulty) up to the city of the higher realms, freedom, and omniscience.
This "something" is also the supreme essence (snying-po) of the teachings of the
Buddhas (those who have "Gone to Bliss"), the very lifeblood (snying) that
allows these teachings to survive in our world.
This "something," that which we call the "vows of individual freedom," is so
named because those individuals who take and then keep them properly will
escape the cycle of suffering, whereas those who don't, will not.

Je Tsongkapa is saying that he is going to explain the vows of individual
freedom, which he only touched upon above, in keeping with the true intent of
the victorious Buddhas. He is going to do so in six categories: their basic nature,
the way they are divided into eight types, their individual descriptions, who can take
them, how they are lost, and the benefits they give when you keep them properly.

The Essence of the Vows of Individual Freedom

,NGES 'BYUNG BSAM PAS RGYU BYAS NAS,
,GZHAN GNOD GZHI DANG BCAS PA LAS,
,LDOG PA   
It is a turning away from harming others,
And its basis, caused by an attitude
Of renunciation...

Here Je Tsongkapa is saying that one's commitment to these vows should be
caused by--that is, motivated by--an attitude where one feels a deep disgust for
every single inch of the cycle of suffering life, and has thus decided to renounce
it. You should not take the vows simply because you are imitating someone
else, or just following the crowd.
The basic nature of the vows then is as follows. In the presence of your Lama,
you agree and pledge yourself to turn away from harming others; you agree to
refrain from the seven physical and verbal deeds which are wrong by nature,
and to avoid their basis as well. Here the word "basis" refers either to the three
mental bad deeds that act as a foundation for the seven, or else to those bad
deeds which were prohibited by Lord Buddha.

,DGE SLONG MA DANG DGE SLONG STE,

Staying close, close to virtue.

And begging for virtue. These are
The eight kinds of individual freedom.

The one-day vows are called "staying close" because they help you stay close
to nirvana in the sense of taking you there. The lifetime vows for laymen and
laywomen are called "close to virtue" because they help you be close to virtue,
which here refers to nirvana. The vows of male novices and female novices
are called "way to virtue" because those who possess these vows have entered
the way, that is the path, which leads to virtue, again referring to nirvana. The
vows of an intermediate nun are called "versed in virtue" because these women
are versing themselves in the twelve rules, in order to be able to keep the vows
of a fully ordained nun. Fully ordained monks and fully ordained nuns are
called "begging for virtue" because they are begging, that is seeking, that state
of virtue: nirvana. In this verse Je Tsongkapa is thus listing the eight kinds of
individual freedom vows.

The root four are sexual activity, stealing something of value, killing a human or
a human fetus, and speaking lies about your spiritual realizations. The secondary
four are (1) making use of a seat or bed which is valuable in that it incorporates
jewels or some other precious substance, or else which is higher than a cubit;
(2) drinking alcohol or any brewed or concocted substance which causes an
intoxicated state; (3) dancing and "so on," which refers to singing and playing
music, or else ornamenting yourself and "such"--that is, wearing jewelry or
makeup; and finally (4) eating food after noon.

The Lifetime Vows for a Layperson

,MYOS 'GYUR 'THUNG BA LNGA SPONG BA,

The five of killing, stealing, and lying,
Adultery, and drinking intoxicants.

The procedure for taking the lifetime vows of a layperson is as follows. In the
presence of a preceptor who holds at least these same vows, you begin with
formally taking refuge. You next pledge that, for the length of your entire life,
you will give up breaking the five basic rules, and avoid as well those actions
which are inconsistent with the advices on going for refuge. The five rules
here are to give up killing a human or human fetus; stealing anything of
significant value (that is, anything worth more than a quarter of a karshapana
[somewhere between an American quarter and a dollar]); lying about your
spiritual attainments; committing adultery by having sexual relations with
someone else's spouse; and drinking alcohol, or any substance which makes you
intoxicated.

The causes for losing your vows are two.
Those shared are returning, dying and moving,
Both organs appearing, changing three times,
And cutting the very root of virtue.

The two causes for losing your vows are the shared causes for losing any of the
eight types of individual freedom vows, and the unique causes for losing
certain ones of them. The shared causes for losing any of the vows are the
following:
returning your vows by pronouncing the words of the ritual for
returning them, where you say "I give back my vows..." and so on in the
presence of a fully-ordained monk or the like;
dying and moving on to your next birth;
having both male and female sexual organs appear on you
simultaneously;
changing sexes three times;
or cutting the very root of your virtue by holding wrong views.

`, GNYIS PA NI,
The unique causes for losing certain ones of the vows are explained in these
lines:

,BSTEN PHYIR KHAS BLANGS NYIN ZHAG 'DAS,

Finding out that you're not twenty,
Agreeing to have, and the end of a day;
These the respective unique for full monks
And nuns, intermediate nuns, and one-day.

The unique causes for losing the vows of a fully-ordained monk, an intermediate
nun, and a one-day vow are, respectively, the following three:
not being twenty years old when you took full monk's vows, but
thinking you were as you did, and then later finding out that you weren't
twenty, while you're still not twenty (here the time spent in the womb is
included in the twenty);
agreeing to have sex with a man;
and the ending of a day (that is, one 24-hour period), which is the amount
of time that you committed to keep the vow.

,GNAS SKABS 'BRAS BU LHA MI DANG ,
,MTHAR THUG 'BRAS BU BYANG CHUB GSUM,

It is stated that, from keeping these vows,
One attains the temporal result of birth
As a pleasure being or human; and as
An ultimate result three enlightenments.

Many times, throughout all of the open and secret teachings of the Buddha and
their commentaries, it is stated that if one keeps properly the eight types of
individual freedom vows which I have just described, then he or she attains the
temporal result of a higher birth as a pleasure being or human, as well as the
ultimate result of "definite good"--which refers to one of the three kinds of
enlightenment: the enlightenment of the listener, the enlightenment of the
Self-Made Buddhas, and the unsurpassable state of total Enlightenment.

An Explanation of the Word "Buddhist Discipline," or "Vinaya"

   'DUL BA'I SDE SNOD KYI BRJOD BYA SPONG BDUN 'KHOR BCAS KYI TSUL KHRIMS KYIS NYON MONGS PA 'DUL ZHING DBANG PO DUL BAR BYED PAS NA 'DUL BA DANG ,
The word "discipline" in the title of this text has a particular meaning. The
subject matter of the section of the canon which treats discipline is that
morality which involves giving up the seven actions, along with what is
associated with them. This morality "disciplines" or tames the mental
afflictions, and also acts to "discipline" or control the senses. This then is why
the subject is known as "discipline."
11
The Ripened Consequences of the Ten Bad Deeds
The following selections are taken from the Great Book on the Steps of the Path
(Lam-rim chen-mo), written by Je Tsongkapa (1357-1419).

LAS LAM BCU PO RE RE YANG GZHI DUG GSUM CHUNG 'BRING CHE GSUM LA BRTEN PAS GSUM GSUM MO, , DE LA SROG GCOD SOGS CHEN PO BCU PO RE RES DMYAL BA, 'BRING BCU PO RE RES YI DVAGS DANG , CHUNG NGU BCU PO RE RES DUD 'GROR SKYE BAR SA'I DNGOS GZHIR GSUNGS LA,
Now each one of the ten paths of karma can itself be divided into three
kinds--lesser, medium, and greater--depending on the intensity of the three
poisons. The Main Stage of Levels states that, from the ten greater instances of
killing and the rest, one is born into the hells. It says that from medium
instances of each of the ten you take birth as an insatiable spirit; and from the
ten lesser instances, you are born as an animal.
12
The Consistent Consequences of the Ten Bad Deeds

The "consistent" consequences are as follows. Even if you do manage to escape
the realms of misery and take birth as a human, the following respective
results occur to you:
1) Your life is short.
2) You don't have enough to live on.
3) You have problems keeping your partner from others.
4) People don't believe what you say, even when you're telling the truth.
5) You lose friends easily.
6) You hear things as bad sounds.
7) No one listens to you.
8) Your personality is dominated by desire.
9) Your personality is dominated by anger.
10) Your personality is dominated by stupidity.

The Chapter on the True and the Sutra on the Ten Levels state that there are two
such consequences for each of the ones given here; even if you do manage to
take birth as a human,
1) Your life is short, and you get sick easily.
2) You don't have enough to live on, and what you do have is all just
common property with others.
3) The people who work around you are "inconsistent," which here
means unreliable, and you find yourself having a lot of competition for
your partner.
4) No one believes what you say, even when you are speaking the truth,
and others are always deceiving you.
5) The people around you are always fighting against one another, and
have an undesirable character.
6) You hear many unpleasant things, and when others talk to you it
always seems to you as if they want to start a fight.
7) No one respects what you say--no one thinks that what you say has
any particular value, and you are afflicted with a lack of confidence.
8) Your personality is dominated by desire, and you are never satisfied
with what you have.
9) You are always finding yourself without help, or never find the help
you need; and you are always hurting others, or always being hurt by
others.
10) You become a person who keeps harmful views, or a deceitful
person.

Great lamas of the past have expressed the position that the "consistent"
consequence is where, even if you do manage to take birth as a human, you
enjoy killing things, and so on. They say then that experiencing the various
results just listed is a "ripened" consequence [the second rgyu mthun here is
likely a text error for rnam smin; this is the corrected reading].

Next is what we call the "environmental" or "dominant" consequence. Here for
example the consequence of killing expresses itself in the outer world around
you. Food, drink, medicine, the crops in the fields, and other such things have
very little power; they are always inferior; they have little nutrition or potency;
they are hard to digest, and they cause disease in you. Because of this the
majority of the living beings around you die before reaching the end of a full
life.

Because you have talked meaninglessly, fruits refuse to grow on the trees, or
they start to grow at the wrong times, never at the right times, and seem ripe
when they're still not ripe, or their roots are frail, or they can't stay long; there

The Special Features of the Teachings on the Steps of the Path
(the Lam Rim)
The following selections are taken from the Song of My Spiritual Life (Nyam-
mgur) of Je Tsongkapa (1357-1419). This text is also known as The Short Book
on the Steps of the Path (Lam-rim bsdus-don). Accompanying the verses of Je
Tsongkapa's root text is a commentary called Illumination of the Essence (Snying-
po mdor-bsdus gsal-ba), composed by Choney Lama Drakpa Shedrup (1675-1748).

This teachings possesses four special features, or you could say four great
qualities. The first is that if you rely on this teaching you will come to realize
that all of the Buddha's teachings are totally lacking any inconsistency. Of all the
teachings spoken by the Victorious Buddhas, however many there may be,
some of them teach the principal paths and others teach that which branches
off from them. Once you know this, you will come to understand that they are
all either direct or indirect factors in reaching enlightenment.
You will not have the wrong view which considers the open and secret
teachings of the Buddha--those highest of all words--and the classical
commentaries which comment upon their true intent to be mere explanations.
You will not think that you have to look somewhere other than in the content
of these books for something to use for your personal practice. Rather you will
come to see that the entire subject matter of the Buddha's supreme speech
along with its classical commentaries is perfectly in keeping with the
progressive structure through which you do your actual practice. You will
come to understand how it is that every step from taking yourself to a Spiritual
Guide all the way up to the practices of developing quietude and special vision
can be put into your personal practice, either through analytical meditation or
through fixation meditation.

If you understand these points, then all of the high speech of the Buddha will
strike you as personal advice. This is the second of the great qualities. Even
though all of the teachings of the Buddha are the ultimate form of personal
instruction, us spiritual beginners who haven't studied enough are unable to
understand the true intent of the great scriptures on our own, nor are we able
to bring them into our personal practice. Therefore we need to rely on
something like this teaching on the steps of the path to enlightenment, through
which our Lamas give us their personal advice on the true meaning of these
original works.
This makes it easy for us to grasp the true intent of the Victorious Buddhas, and
that is another great quality of the teaching on the steps. Once you find this
true intent, you will understand that every word the Buddha ever said
contributes either directly or indirectly to our reaching enlightenment, and that
there is not a single word He spoke which does not teach a method of
achieving enlightenment.
In the Buddha's teachings there can appear to be some slight inconsistencies,
which are required due to the needs of particular disciples, and there are also
distinctions between the higher and lower teachings. But there is no difference
between any of them from the point of view that they were all taught solely
as methods for reaching enlightenment. If you become certain of this, you will
never commit the bad deed of rejecting Buddhist teachings, and will thus be
protected from falling into the chasm of that great mistake. This is the last of the
four great qualities.

After having done this, see that
the very foundation
Of an excellent start for all the good
in this and your future lives
Is the holy Spiritual Guide
who teaches you the path.
Make efforts to rely on Him properly
in your thoughts and in your actions;
Please Him with the offering of
carrying out His every instruction.
And never give it up, not even
at the cost of your life.
I, the master meditator,

First you must contemplate the points above, such as the great benefits that
come from putting into practice all, or even just a part of, the steps of the path.
After having done this, says Je Tsongkapa, you should begin the actual practices
which are to follow. He uses these words to lead the reader into the actual
steps of the path.

Having understood these benefits, you must then see that the holy Spiritual
Guide who teaches you the path is the very foundation for getting you off to an
excellent start for all the good in this and your future lives. Realize that all this
depends on how you serve your Lama, and then with fierce efforts rely on Him
in your thoughts by stopping that state of mind which thinks it sees faults in
Him, and by developing feelings of faith towards Him as much as you can.
Rely properly on your Lama in your actions by paying Him respect with your
body, praising Him with your words, and so forth. Undertake whatever you
can to please your Lama in every possible way, and never undertake anything
which would displease Him. Accomplish whatever He or She tells you to do.
Understanding this, you must please your Lama with the offering of carrying out
His every instruction. You can never give this up even at the cost of you life, so
what need is there to say anything about mere small incidents?

Not only is it true that you are impermanent and must die, but after you die
you must take birth exactly where your white and black deeds throw you.
Good deeds throw you into the higher realms and bring you experiences of
happiness, whereas bad deeds throw you into the lower realms and bring you
experiences of suffering.
As you haven't been able to accumulate many causes to be born in the higher
realms, but have rather collected many causes to be born in the lower realms,
there is no guarantee that in your next life you will not born in the hells or the
other lower realms. Not only is there no guarantee that you will not be born
there, in all likelihood you will be born there. Contemplate again and again
the sufferings of the lower realms, and try to develop a very strong desire to
be free from them.

If you don't make efforts to contemplate
what's wrong with the truth of suffering,
You won't be able to develop as your should
the aspiration to be free.
And if you don't think of how the truth of the source
throws you into the cycle of life,
Then you won't understand the way to cut
the cycle of suffering from its root.

From the very beginning, those who wish to free themselves from cyclic
existence must contemplate what's wrong with the truth of suffering and the
truth of the source of suffering. The truth of suffering includes both the general
sufferings of the three lower realms and the higher realms, as well as the
specific sufferings of birth, old age, aging, sickness, death, and so on.
If you don't make great efforts to contemplate what's wrong with this cycle of
suffering, then you will not get any great wish to be free from suffering, and
you will not be able to develop the state of mind in which you aspire toward
freedom in the way that you should.
You must understand the details of the nature of desire and the other (mental
afflictions), and how they develop, because if you don't think about how the truth
of the source of suffering acts to throw you into the cycle of life, then you won't
understand how to cut the very root of the cycle of suffering. It would be like
shooting an arrow at a target you can't see.
20
The Truth of Suffering

,SRID LAS NGES 'BYUNG SKYO SHAS BRTAN PA DANG ,
With a solid disgust for this existence
that definitely wants to get out,

Look at all of the suffering in this circle of life; look at birth, aging, sickness
and death, at grief and crying out in pain, at our mental unhappiness, at the
heat and the cold, all the fighting, and on and on. Then with a fierce and solid

disgust for this existence that definitely wants to get out of the cycle of suffering
you must try to understand the cause which creates this suffering, as it will be
explained later in the text.
21
The Truth of the Source of Suffering

,'KHOR BAR GANG GIS BCINGS PA SHES PA GCES,
,RNAL 'BYOR NGAS KYANG NYAMS LEN DE LTAR BGYIS,
,THAR 'DOD KHYED KYANG DE BZHIN BSKYANG 'TSAL LO,
Finding out about this suffering cycle
should be treated with great concern.
I, the master meditator,
put this into practice;
You, who seek for freedom, must
try to practice this way.

Finding out about what chains you to this suffering cycle should be treated as
something extremely important and with great concern. You are chained by
both your deeds and your bad thoughts. If we were to divide these out into
all of their different forms, there would be a great many of them. To state it
in a nutshell, the mental afflictions in the mindstream of a common
person--that is, desire, anger, pride, ignorance, bad forms of doubt, jealousy,
and so on--are all the truth of the source of suffering in the form of mental
afflictions, and the deeds which are motivated by them--both virtuous and
non-virtuous--are the truth of the source of suffering in the form of deeds.

It is mainly because of our ignorance that we collect these deeds, and it is
because of the deeds themselves that we are thrown into the cycle of life. We
must gain a good understanding of all the steps in the twelve links of
dependent origination, through which this process takes place.
To put it briefly, you must rely on the personal instructions of a spiritual
guide, and thus come to realize how it is that your deeds and your bad
thoughts make you circle around in this cycle of life. Then you will
understand the truth of the source--the process through which you are thrown
into cyclic life.

Wisdom is an eye that allows you to see
the profound state of suchness,
And a path that tears from its very root
the cycle of suffering life.
It's a goldmine of spiritual qualities
praised in every holy book,
And renowned as the highest lamp
for lighting the darkness of ignorance.

It's impossible that single-pointed concentration
by itself could ever have
The power to cut the very root
of the cycle of suffering life;
And wisdom which is separated
from the path of quietude
Could never stop your mental afflictions,
no matter how much you analyzed.
Mount then the wisdom that rips apart
the reality of how things are
On the horse of meditative quietude
that cannot ever sway.

Next use the razor sword of the logic
of the middle way free of extremes
To destroy all tendencies to think
in a way that holds an extreme.
Take this far-spreading wisdom that examines
things in the proper way
To bring the knowledge that perceives simple suchness
to prosper ever further.
I, the master meditator,
put this into practice;
You, who seek for freedom, must
try to practice this way.

The path that's commended for reaching
the perfection of the deeds of the children
Of the Victors is combining the two
of method and wisdom having meditated
On both the emptiness of absorption,
the one like empty space,
And the emptiness of the aftermath:
the one like an illusion.
The way of those blessed by goodness
is to understand this fact,
And never be satisfied with only
a piece or a part of the path.

put this into practice;
You, who seek for freedom, must

Course XVII: The Great Ideas of Buddhism, Part Two
Reading Nine: The Bodhisattva's Way of Life, First of Six Parts
The following story recounts in brief some of the events in the life of the great
bodhisattva Shantideva. It is a paraphrase of sections from the Life Stories of
the Lineage Teachers of the Steps of the Path (Lam-rim bla-ma brgyud-pa'i rnam-thar)
written by Yongdzin Yeshe Gyeltsen (1713-1793), the teacher of the eighth Dalai
Lama.
1
The Life of Master Shantideva, in Brief
Master Shantideva was born to the west of Bodhgaya, the Seat of the Diamond,
in a place called Yulkor Mosang. His father was a king named Armor of
Virtue, and his mother was said to be an emanation of Vajra Yogini, the Angel
of Diamond. He was able to choose the details of his birth, and when he was
born he was given the name Armor of Peace. In his childhood he had all the
favorable conditions that he needed, and from his earliest age he revealed
himself to be a master of the traditional philosophical and other sciences.
When he was six years old he met a great practitioner of the secret teachings,
and received an initiation and a practice for reaching the enlightened being
named Manjushri, or Gentle Voice. As a child he made great efforts in this
practice, doing its meditations and reciting its secret words, and was soon able
to meet Gentle Voice himself. After meeting this holy being, Master
Shantideva was able to receive many teachings from him directly.
When his father the King passed away, all the people of the land requested
Prince Shantideva to be King. Because he had practiced the bodhisattva path
in many previous lives, he had no desire to live a life of royalty, but so as not
to upset the people he agreed. The night before his crowning ceremony
though he had a dream. In the dream he saw Gentle Voice sitting on the
King's throne, and He said, "Son, this is my seat and I am your Teacher. It
would be improper for us to sit on the same seat." Upon waking he realized
that it was wrong for him to enjoy the pleasures of owning a kingdom, and he
ran away.

Master Shantideva first went to Nalandra Monastery where he met the
supreme leader of all the learned scholars there. His name was Angel of
Virtue, and from this teacher he took the commitment to leave the home life.
It also was from this master that he received the name Shantideva, which
means "Angel of Peace." At the monastery he served his preceptor well,
studied the three collections of scripture, and became a great scholar. He
continued to receive many teachings from Gentle Voice himself, and was able
to grasp the meaning of all the Buddha's teachings, both open and secret. He
eliminated all the different kinds of distraction, both inner and outer, and with
this incredible focus of mind he reached a very high spiritual level. He then
composed the works entitled the Compendium of Trainings, the Compendium of
the Sutras, and other books which describe the amazingly powerful and
effective way of the life of a bodhisattva. Master Shantideva perfected within
himself the three characteristics of a great Buddhist master--teaching, debating,
and writing--and continued to rise up all the spiritual levels and paths. He
achieved the ability to remember everything he had ever been taught, the
ability to perform miracles effortlessly, and incredible clairvoyance; thus he
became a god among bodhisattvas.
This was his inner life, but to the eyes of impure people Shantideva seemed to
be interested in only three things: eating, sleeping, and going to the toilet. He
thus became known by the name Bhusuku, which means "Mister Three
Thoughts." Because the only fitting activity for a man who has left the home
life is to involve himself in teaching, some of the monks who could not see
who he really was perceived Master Shantideva as someone who was just
living off the kindness of the laypeople, and decided that they should expel
him from the monastery. They asked him to recite a scripture from memory
before a gathering of the monastery, hoping that their request would cause him
to decide to leave on his own. He answered them by saying, "How could
someone like me ever be able to recite scripture?" and declined. However
they insisted that he do so, and eventually he agreed.
The entire monastery was then invited to this gathering, and a very high
throne was set up, one without any stairs--so there was no way for anyone to
climb atop it. But when the bodhisattva Shantideva reached the front of the
throne, he touched it gently, and without the slightest effort he appeared
sitting on top of it. He then asked and said, "Would you like me to recite
something you have heard before, or something which you have never heard?"
The assembly asked that he recite something that they had not heard before,
and so he began to recite that book which we call the Guide to the Bodhisattva's
Way of Life. He began at the very beginning of the text, and by the time he had
gotten about a third of the way through the ninth chapter he began to rise up
into the sky. He rose higher and higher, and it seemed as though the sky and
his knowledge were pitted in competition, until he could no longer be seen at
all, only heard. Then he totally disappeared.

Later on some of the monks who had clairvoyance of the ear, and others who
were masters of total recall, pieced the whole book together. The group who
were from Kashmir said that it had nine chapters, and the group from central
India said it had ten. People then began to get curious about two of his other
books which were mentioned in the fifth chapter of the Guide, and so they sent
two monks to the place where Master Shantideva was living. They travelled
to a stupa in the south of India called Pelyun Chen to invite him to come back
to Nalandra. The master refused to come, but he did tell them that the people
from central India were correct, and that the two books they sought could be
found written in tiny letters hidden in the rafters of his old room at the
monastery. He then gave these monks a complete explanation of the both the
Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life and the Compendium of Trainings.
Later Master Shantideva was wondering what he could do to help others, and
so he decided to check with his clairvoyance. He saw in the east a great many
people whose lives were disturbed by a terrible dispute and, seeing that he
could help, set off in their direction. While he was there he acted as the
opponent of the great argument maker who was causing all the trouble, and
with his great powers he was able to bring everyone back together.
He then thought to himself, "What further could I do to benefit people?" The
idea then came to him that he should travel to the kingdom of Magada in
order to help the people living there who had fallen into the chasm of wrong
views. When he arrived, he found a great many people who had extremely
weird wrong views, and he decided to stay with them for some time. One
day, due to his extraordinary power and to the purity of the prayers these
people had made in their past lives, there occurred an enormous blizzard. The
storm lasted for seven days, and the community ran out of food and drink.
They began to go crazy, and decided that whoever was able to come up with
something to eat and drink would become their leader. The bodhisattva
Shantideva was miraculously able to fill a single alms bowl with rice, and from
it fed everybody in the community. As their leader he was then able to
demolish their wrong views, and lead them into the Buddha's teachings.
Master Shantideva next checked with his clairvoyance to see who else needed
help. He saw many people suffering from a famine, in desperate need of help,
and thousands about to die. He provided these people with sustenance, taught
them the teachings of the Buddha, and thus brought them to happiness.
Then the great bodhisattva thought to himself, "What could I do to help the
teachings of the Buddha?" He saw that if he were to assist a certain king it
would aid many people. He journeyed to the crossroads near his palace, and
began to assess the situation. He found a great crowd of mighty, but merciless
people. There were a lot of them gathered already, and many others like them
on their way. These people were aware of the king's great wealth, and this fact
was causing the king much distress. He thought that if he were to use all of

his wealth to pay off these people, then having obtained the kingdom would
be of no point; but also that if he did not, then they would surely separate his
mind from his body. Master Shantideva took a liking to the king, and
arranged to be his bodyguard. Because he had limitless power and might, he
was able to overpower all of the evil people, and put the king and his people
at ease. During all this time Master Shantideva had no weapon other than a
single wooden sword, a sword resembling the sword of Gentle Voice.
The whole kingdom began to develop great faith and respect for Master
Shantideva, and made many offerings to him. But there was one man who
was very jealous of him, and could not bear all of his success. He went to the
king and told him that Master Shantideva was a devious man. He told the
king that Shantideva had nothing more then a wooden sword, and that he
would never be able to protect him if anything happened. He said to the king,
"This man is a deceiving you. Even his sword is nothing more than wood, and
so he could never be able to guard your body"; and advised the king to
investigate. The king became angered, went to Master Shantideva, and told
him to take his sword out of its scabbard. The bodhisattva replied saying,
"Your Highness will be hurt if I do so," but the king told him to do it anyway,
whether it hurt him or not. Master Shantideva then said to him, "I agree then
to take it out, but I advise Your Highness to cover one of your eyes. The king
covered one eye as instructed, and when the great bodhisattva pulled out the
sword, it blazed with such a light that the king's exposed eye was blinded.
The King apologized, took refuge in Master Shantideva, and entered into the
teachings of the Buddha.
After this Master Shantideva thought to himself, "What next can I do to be of
help to others?" He checked with his clairvoyance, and saw there were many
non-Buddhists who opposed the Teachings and needed to be subdued. He
went to where they lived in the south, and dressed himself as a beggar. One
day a servant of the King saw him and noticed that drops of water which
touched his body instantly began to boil.
There was a non-Buddhist teacher living in this land who decided that he
wanted to compete with a Buddhist in miraculous powers. He made a deal
with the king that whoever lost this competition would have to convert to the
other's religion, and that the winner could burn all of the monasteries and
books of the loser's religion. The King could find no one of the Buddhist
community who would agree to these conditions, and he grieved. Then the
servant who had seen the miracle with Master Shantideva told him about it.
The King sent out messengers to seek him, and to beg for his help in defeating
the non-Buddhist teacher.
The bodhisattva Shantideva told them that he would be able to help, and that
they should prepare a large bowl of water, two bolts of cloth, and a fire. On
the day of the competition the whole kingdom gathered, and a throne was

prepared for the King. The two opponents began their debates, and because
of the power of Master Shantideva's reasoning and scriptural knowledge, his
opponent was unable to even respond. Because of this he thought he'd try to
win with his miraculous powers instead, and so he began to draw the secret
world of a powerful Hindu god in the sky. But before he had finished
drawing even its eastern side, the bodhisattva Shantideva went into a deep
meditation on the element of wind and brought about a great storm which
began to tear apart the entire area.
The King, Queen, and the others assembled ran for cover, and the non-
Buddhist teacher and his secret world were thrown about in every direction,
like sparrows caught in a hurricane. A great darkness descended upon all the
land, and Master Shantideva sent rays of light out from a spot between his
eyes to light the way for the King and the Queen. Their clothes had been
ripped off and they were covered in dust, so the great bodhisattva bathed them
in the water from the bowl, dressed them in the cloth, and put them near the
fire, where they could warm themselves.
Master Shantideva's activities were exclusively dedicated to the benefit of
living beings, and to helping the Buddha's teachings. Everything he did was
meant to express the truth of the saying: "Men are like the mango fruit.
Sometimes they look ripe on the outside, but are not ripe on the inside. Others
are ripe on the inside, but don't look ripe on the outside. Some look and are
ripe both inside and out, and others don't look ripe truly are not." For people
like us who haven't seen emptiness directly, it is very difficult to judge
another's mind. Generally speaking then we should never allow ourselves to
think that anyone at all has any bad qualities, and we should realize more
specifically that criticizing anyone who has entered the Buddha's teachings is
like playing near a pit of embers concealed in ash. It is important that we not
criticize other people, and to try to see all things as pure. It is to express this
fact that Master Shantideva lived the way that he did.
He also taught us by example many other lessons. Never be satisfied with
wrong or partial paths. Train yourself in paths which are complete. Practice
what is taught in this bodhisattva's books. If you take Gentle Voice as your
personal Angel, you will be able to achieve all wonderful qualities. It isn't
fitting to put any faith in books which can't bring you to total enlightenment.
The only entry point for those who wish for freedom is the teachings of
Enlightened Beings. So if you wish to practice the teachings of the steps of the
path to enlightenment, make supplication to this great bodhisattva; and learn
about, contemplate, and meditate on his words.

This book presents, in their entirety, each one of the steps of the path to
enlightenment. It begins by telling you the way to practice the contemplations
for people of lesser and medium capacity as an adjunct to practicing the
contemplations for people of great capacity. Then it goes on to teach you how
to develop the wish to achieve supreme enlightenment, and how--after you
have developed that wish--you should train yourself in the perfection of
giving, along with the other five perfections.

The first chapter explains how, in the beginning, you must increase your joyful
energy to its very highest by thoroughly contemplating the benefits which
come from developing the wish to achieve supreme enlightenment. This
chapter also touches upon the way you should practice, as an adjunct, the
contemplations for people of lesser and medium capacity.

You must go about developing the wish to achieve supreme enlightenment,
that wish whose very root is love and compassion, in the same way that you
would go about preparing to welcome a King who ruled the entire world by
cleaning your house, and so on. You will be able to acquire this wish by
purifying all of the factors which obstruct your spiritual realizations, and
gathering together the power of good deeds which promote them. These two
subjects are covered respectively in the second and third chapters.

The fourth chapter teaches you why you must be careful once you have
developed the wish, so that the good energy you have amassed from training
yourself in the activities of a bodhisattva does not degenerate.
The chapters which follow teach you how to put the six perfections into
practice. With regard to this, the fifth chapter is devoted to an extensive
presentation of how to train yourself to live an ethical life through maintaining
your mindfulness and awareness, and the next four chapters are successively
devoted to how to train yourself in not getting angry, joyfully doing good
deeds, meditative concentration, and wisdom.

The tenth chapter explains in detail how you can learn that attitude which
wants to give away to others your own body, all of your possessions, along
with every good thing you've ever done. And it teaches you how to sweeten
your acts of giving through dedication. Although the tenth chapter treats with
great thoroughness how it is that you should train yourself in the perfection
of giving, this subject is also taught on other occasions, such as in the chapter
on how to develop the wish for enlightenment. The subject of what it is to be
a Buddha, which is the final result, is treated in the ninth chapter.

What the Buddhas Think is Important

,THUB DBANG RNAMS KYIS 'DI NYID PHAN PAR GZIGS,
The Lords among Victors contemplated the question
For many millions of years and saw
That this alone could be of benefit.

Again we can say that making efforts to practice the wish is something which
is very right to do. This is because the Lords among Victors have considered and
contemplated, for many "countless" periods of millions of years each, the question
of what could be of benefit to, or a way to achieve the ends of, all living beings.
And what they saw was that this wish for enlightenment alone would be so.

It is this wish for enlightenment which is like a special seed, one that has the
power which allows a limitless number of living beings, a great mass of sentient
kind, to attain the highest form of happiness. And it allows them to do so with

ease, with perfect ease--that is, without having to undertake any such difficult
spiritual practices as undertaking the life of a cave-dwelling yogi. It's just as
the lines say which go,
What person with any intelligence at all
Would lose heart in going easily to ease?

Practicing the wish for enlightenment is moreover a right thing to do for those
who hope to see their good deeds never die, but increase ever further. This is
because all other good deeds, meaning those that are not imbued by this wish,
are like the plantain tree: they give their fruits and, once they have done so, it is
always the case that their ability to produce further fruits dies away. The wish
for enlightenment though is an evergreen: it is like a wish-giving tree, in that it
never dies by giving its fruits, but rather ever increases, higher and higher.

As the Sutra Taught by Inexhaustible Understanding states,
A drop of water which falls into the great sea never disappears,
even in the period of an eon of millions of years. Virtues which
have been dedicated to enlightenment are just the same: they
never disappear before the state of perfect enlightenment is
achieved.

A person may have committed deeds
That are dreadful in the extreme, and yet
Anyone who relies on this can be freed

Not choose to rely upon this very wish?

This wish for enlightenment has a tremendous ability to destroy the effects of
bad deeds. It is as though this wish were the fire that comes at the end of time,
meaning at the end of the eon of destruction--the fire that destroys the entire
physical world from the first meditation level on down. This is because the
wish can burn, with certainty, and in a single instant, even the greatest of bad deeds:
those deeds which would force one into a birth in the hells.
If the wish, by the way, has the power to destroy even those kinds of karma
which are certain to produce an experience, then there is no need to say that

it has the ability to do so with those types of karma which are not certain to
produce an experience. Those of the Greater Vehicle can utilize an act of
purification, in which all four of the forces of purification are present, in order
to purify themselves of the expected ripening of those types of karma which
are certain to produce an experience. The expression "certain to produce an
experience" then refers to those kinds of karma which are proven, through
many cases of scriptural authority and also through reasoning, to be certain to
produce an experience unless one practices the appropriate antidote to their power.

The fourth section here concerns purifying yourself of bad deeds, through
using all four of the forces together. We begin with a general presentation.
You should from the very beginning make efforts to see that you are not
sullied by performing any harmful actions. Despite your efforts, however,
such an action may occur, due to some instance of carelessness, an attack of
mental afflictions, or the like. It would be a mistake in such a case to simply
ignore the bad deed; you should rather exert yourself in the various methods
of repairing the damage. These methods were taught by our compassionate
Teacher.

,DE YANG LTUNG BA PHYIR BCOS NI SDOM PA GONG 'OG SO SO NAS GSUNGS PA LTAR BYA LA SDIG PA PHYIR BCOS PA NI STOBS BZHI'I SGO NAS BYA STE, CHOS BZHI BSTAN PA'I MDO LAS, BYAMS PA BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA' SEMS DPA' CHEN PO CHOS BZHI DANG LDAN NA SDIG PA

Instances in which you have committed some transgression of your vows, at
whichever level of vows you may have, should be repaired according to the
methods prescribed for those particular vows. For repairing the damage
caused by other kinds of bad deeds you should utilize the four powers. As the
Sutra on the Four Practices states,
If, oh Loving One, some great bodhisattva has
succeeded in the four practices, then even those bad
deeds which have been both committed and
collected can be overcome. What are the four
practices? They are as follows: the activity of
destruction; the activity of applying the antidote;
the force of restraining from the particular bad
deed; and the force of the foundation.
The expression "committed and collected" refers to actions whose karmic
results are "certain to be experienced." If even these types of karmic results can
be overcome by the four practices, then there is no need to mention those
which are not certain to be experienced.

DE LA STOBS DANG PO NI MI DGE BA'I LAS BYAS PA LA 'GYOD PA MANG BA YIN TE 'DI SKYE BA LA MI DGE BA'I LAS KYIS 'BRAS BU GSUM BSKYED TSUL LEGS PAR BSGOM DGOS SO,
The first of these four forces involves feeling strong regret over having
committed some negative action. In order to achieve this level of regret, you
must contemplate carefully the way in which negative actions trigger three
different karmic results.

The second force, as described in the Compendium of Trainings, consists of
performing practices such as studying the profound scriptures of the canon,
meditating on emptiness, reciting secret words, preparing physical
representations of the holy bodies of enlightened beings, making offerings, and
reciting the names of high beings.

The third force is to restrain yourself perfectly from ever committing these
negative actions again in the future. The fourth consists of meditating upon
the wish for enlightenment, and similar practices. Here it is the first force
which is described in great detail. The points to be considered are the time at
which the bad deeds may have been committed, the cause, the mode of
expression, the undertaking of the deed, its object, and how the deed was
committed.

Don't Wait to Destroy the Bad Karma You've Done Before

,YID BRTAN MI RUNG 'CHI BDAG 'DI,
,BYAS DANG MA BYAS MI SDOD PAS,
,NA DANG MI NA KUN GYIS KYANG ,
,GLO BUR TSE LA YID MI BRTAN,
This Lord of Death cannot be trusted,
He waits for no one, finished or not.
He takes all sorts suddenly, those sick and well,
So feel not certain about your life.

"What kind of protection," one may ask, "is it that we need, so quickly, while
we have yet to die, and have still not purified ourselves of our bad deeds?"
This Lord of Death cannot be trusted, even for a single moment of time, and he
waits for no one: he has absolutely no interest in whether you have finished
purifying yourself of your negative actions or not. His coming in no way
depends upon whether what you have hoped to do is done or not. All sorts
of people die suddenly, before their life has reached its normal length, and
whether they have gone through some sickness or whether they are well.
Therefore you should feel no certainty about your life, no assurance even that you
will not die this very day. And since this fact that you can feel no certainty is
true, you should quickly purify yourself of your negative actions.

And it was wrong to commit bad deeds for these reasons, because shortly
afterwards the enemies cease to exist, and the friends to cease to exist, and I myself
cease to exist as well. Just so everything else, the relatives and the possessions
and so on, ceases too. Nothing is in the least bit dependable, and so I should
also feel regret at having committed negative actions due to any attachment or
dislike for any of them.

Think of some minor pleasure that you might experience during a dream. When
you wake up, the pleasure is no longer anything but a memory. All the objects
that you might deceive yourself into thinking are pleasant in this life, and
which you use, are the same. When you die they are soon nothing but some
memory. Therefore you should resolve, from this moment on, and time and
time again, that you will only practice the Dharma. All those things that have
passed are no longer here, and so they become nothing more than a memory.

who were our friends, and many who were our enemies, slip into the past. But
whatever dreadful consequences there may be from all the negative that we
committed for their sakes still lies before us. It's like the lines that say,
Since they can never take upon themselves
Any share of the suffering,
What use then are the best of friends,
Who only serve to hinder us?
Thus we must feel, over and over again, deep regret at having committed bad
deeds for their sakes.

I commit a great number of different bad deeds, due to my ignorance, my tendency
of liking some things, and disliking other things. These now will take me to a
birth in the lower realms. I must contemplate thus the facts of how my death
is certain, and how the time that I will die is not certain at all, and how when
I die there is nothing at all that can help me except the Dharma. I must think
carefully too of all the problems of these lower realms. I must feel, and feel
again and again, deep regret then at having committed these negative deeds.

Their whole appearance from before is transformed:
Their mouths go dry, eyes bulge, and the rest.
Suppose then that you are taken hold of
By the messengers of the Lord of Death,
By those monstrous and terrifying creatures,
And are stricken by that great fear, the unique pain.

At that moment nothing you can do for yourself.

Here is the second point. You are going to have to give up everything: this
body that you have here, while you are alive, and just so your friends and relatives
as well. And then you will have to go on alone, to "who knows where;" that is, to
a place which you cannot now know for sure. And so what is the use of any of
your friends or enemies? They can be of no help at all, and thus it is wrong for
you to feel any attachment for them.

Next is the pledge to restrain ourselves. For this reason I make the following
request to the Guides: "The bad deeds I have committed are mistakes, and I ask you
to consider them mistakes. The bad things I have done are nothing good, and from
this moment on, even at the cost of my life, I will never commit any single one of
them at all, ever again." By doing so we stop the flow of our bad deeds, and
restrain ourselves from them again.
The teachings of the Buddha, and the commentaries upon them, present a great
number of ways in which we can clean ourselves of our bad deeds. The one
antidote which is totally complete though is this purification, this practice of
using all four forces together to do the purifying. It is stated in a number of
scriptures--for example, in the Blaze of Reasoning and in the Great Commentary
to the Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Verses--that this practice can erase
even those bad deeds which are definite to lead to the experience of a karmic
result.

People like you and I have no great knowledge of the various laws of actions
and their consequences. Even that very little bit which we do understand we
are unable to put into practice as we should. Every single day then we commit
negative actions in a great variety of different ways. Because of this we must
follow the path of purifying ourselves of our bad deeds on a continual basis.
And we should make efforts in the practice especially with the intention of
purifying ourselves of those thoughts and actions which block us from being
able to develop the true wish for enlightenment.

The Asian Classics Institute
Course XVII: The Great Ideas of Buddhism, Part Two
Reading Ten: The Bodhisattva's Way of Life, Second of Six Parts
The following selections are taken from the Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life
(Byang-chub-sems-dpa'i spyod-pa la 'jug-pa) by Master Shantideva (c. 700 AD).
The commentary to a number of the selections comes from the Entry Point for
Children of the Victorious Buddhas (rGyal-sras 'jug-ngogs), an explanation of
Master Shantideva's work by the premier disciple of Je Tsongkapa, Gyaltsab
Je Darma Rinchen (1364-1432).

How is it that we uplift our hearts? With this moment--that is, at the point
where I develop the wish and take the vows--my life has become fruitful; now
I have truly achieved a human life, in the sense that I have given meaning to the
spiritual leisure and fortune with which I was born. Today I have been born into
the family of the Buddhas: I have become a bodhisattva. Practice the feeling of
gladness, thinking to yourself, "Now I have become a child of the Buddhas"--for
this is the prayer wherein one thinks to oneself, "When is it that I will become
a child of the Buddhas?"

Here is the second point. You may wonder whether this act alone is enough.
It is not, for you must then make the resolution: "Now, no matter what, I will
undertake only those actions of the three doors which are fitting for those who belong
to the family of my new fathers, the Buddhas. I will keep my family one which

is holy, one which is at all times--in the beginning, and during, and at the end
of any action--forever made beautiful: faultless, and filled only with wonderful
qualities. I will make every effort I can to assure that my mind is never defiled
by breaking my vows--the rules that have been set forth for those that are
following the wish both in the form of a prayer, and in the form of action.

Here is the first. There are those "poor deluded ones," meaning people who are
worthy of our pity, who are willing to suffer to kill those who are going to die by
their very nature; that is, who will die by themselves anyway, without anyone
having to kill them. These people "advance to war," meaning they go to fight
in a war, with fanatical hopes of destroying their enemy. They are so intent on
this goal that they completely ignore whatever suffering is inflicted upon
themselves, the pain of being hit by some weapon like an arrow or spear. They
have decided never to turn back, never to withdraw from the field, until they have
achieved their aim of destroying their opponent. We on the other hand are faced
with enemies that are the cause of all of our sufferings, all the time. They are the
true enemy, a pure enemy: an enemy who is an enemy by nature, and who has
always been so, from the moment we were born. There is no need to say that I
must be the same as those other fighters: I must never become discouraged, never
lessen in my resolve, never lose my warrior's heart, no matter what hardships I
may have to face in the task of destroying this enemy. I must bear with
whatever comes, even if it brings me hundreds of sufferings such as cold, hunger,
thirst, or anything of the like. And it is right that I must never let up my
efforts until I have been able to subdue the enemy of the mental afflictions.

we consider these pains then a problem? We should rather embrace them, for
they can only help us.

Here is the third point. Someone might make the following statement: "I admit
that I am a person who has agreed to undertake the destruction of the mental
afflictions within the minds of other persons. It would be wrong though for
me to work to destroy the mental afflictions in my own mind, because if I
succeeded in doing so I would have fallen into what is called the 'extreme of
personal peace.'" You have though pledged yourself, and developed the wish, to
free all living beings, beings as vast in extent as the ten different directions of space
itself, from their mental afflictions. If at the same time you have failed to free you
yourself from all your own mental afflictions, then you have failed even in the
endeavor of accomplishing all your own needs, much less those of others. Are
you not some kind of madman then, to say that you are going to free every other
living being from their mental afflictions, while at the very same moment you
have failed completely to judge your own level--the fact that you yourself are still
at the mercy of your own mental afflictions? No one chained in the cycle of
suffering of life themselves could ever accomplish all the goals of other living
beings, and so you should rather make efforts to destroy the mental afflictions
within your own mind.

Here is the first of the two. The mental afflictions are, therefore, things which
deserve to be eliminated. As such, I should never turn back, either in my
thoughts or my actions, from the task of destroying them, even for a single moment.
I should get attached to these antidotes for the mental afflictions; that is, I should
make use of the antidotes. And I should learn to hate the mental afflictions, and
make war on them, and smash them.

Someone may ask the following question: "You seem to be describing some
kind of bias in the attitude we should have towards the antidotes that
eliminate our mental afflictions, and you have spoken about hating the thing
that the antidote is supposed to eliminate. Aren't these types of thoughts
themselves just another kind of mental affliction--that is, the very thing which

we are trying to eliminate?" These kinds of attitudes--of being attached to the
antidotes for mental affliction, and of hating the mental afflictions we are
trying to eliminate--are themselves only apparent mental afflictions. Because
they are included into the antidote side--that is, because they are part of what
acts to destroy the mental afflictions--they are not counted among the objects which
we seek to eliminate from our minds. There are commentaries which do state
that these are themselves something to be destroyed later, but what they mean
by saying this is that, once one has finished off all the objects to be eliminated,
one need no longer make war.

They are like an illusion, and so
I should eliminate this fear from my heart,
And rely on the practice of making great efforts,
Working to develop wisdom.
Why should I subject myself pointlessly

Here is the third point. Someone else might come and assert the following:
"We could never be able to eliminate mental afflictions even once, because they
grow with the mind itself, and exist as part of the very nature of things." It's
not true that the mental afflictions exist by nature among the objects which we
perceive: visual objects and the rest. If this were the case, then mental
afflictions would start to grow even in enemy destroyers, as they looked upon
visual objects and such.

Neither do the mental afflictions exist in this way among the group of the physical
powers, such as the eye. This is because a person who is directing his or her
thoughts towards the meaning of the actual reality of things may still possess
the power of the eye, and yet not have any mental affliction.

Nor do the mental afflictions exist somewhere throughout these two possibilities,
nor somewhere other than the two: once you have eradicated them from their
very root, there is nowhere at all that they can stay: that they can by some kind
of nature go and remain, to return then to do harm to every living being.

One might have the following thought: "These mental afflictions are empty of
any natural kind of existence, but at the same time they do appear to have
natural existence, and so they are like an illusion. As long as this is the
case--because they do exist through some nature of their own--I could never
eliminate them from their root." It is good though if I can eliminate this fear
from my heart, and rely on the practice of making great efforts to remove my mental
afflictions, through working to develop the wisdom which perceives emptiness.
Given that I therefore have at the present moment the ability to remove these
afflictions, it is not good on the other hand that I subject myself pointlessly to the
sufferings of the lower realms, to hells and the rest. Why should I put myself
through these pains? Some commentators have also explained the previous
lines as referring to the fact that, once we remove the seeds for the mental
afflictions, they can no longer stay in these various places.

Here is the first. Suppose someone were to assert the following: "We can posit
something as the perfection of giving when the culmination of this perfection of
giving results in removing the poverty of each and every living being." If though
there were living beings who still suffered from hunger, and there are, how then
could the Protectors of the past, the Buddhas, ever have reached the culmination
of the perfection of giving? It would be illogical.

Here is the second point, which is a kind of summary: "Therefore it was spoken
that the culmination of the perfection of giving occurs when one has perfectly
accustomed oneself to the kind of thought where one wishes to give all that one
has--one's body, one's possessions, and the total sum of one's good deeds,
along with the power of the virtue that results from giving these things
away--to every living being. This then is the reason why, it is because of this, that
giving is only something that depends upon the state of mind."

Here is the first point. It must be incorrect to say that the culmination of the
perfection of an ethical life should depend on trying to reach the end of the last
living being who is being killed. Because how could you ever chase every wild
beast, and every fish, and every other such being to some place where no one could
kill any of them? You never could.

,SPONG BA'I SEMS NI THOB PA LAS,

Here is the second. Therefore, for this reason, it is explained in sutra that the
culmination of the perfection of an ethical way of life consists of attaining the
culmination of the constant practice of a way of thinking wherein one wishes to
abandon any idea of harming someone else, or of stealing anything. The sutra
at this point says, "What is the perfection of an ethical way of life? It is the
way of thinking in which one abandons anything that is harmful to others."

The third part, on the perfection of patience, has three sections: the point, a
metaphor, and the connection between the point and the metaphor. Here is
the first. You have reached the culmination of patience with the destruction of
a single object--the thought of anger, which is comparable to destroying each and
every one of your external enemies. You would have to admit that the
culmination of this perfection is not something that depends on finishing off
every possible object which could make you angry though, because it would be
a complete, or entire, impossibility ever to accomplish the destruction of every
single irritating person, for these are as limitless in extent as space itself.
Therefore patience is also something that depends upon the mind.

Earth with leather, in order to prevent the thorns and so on there from hurting
your feet. How could you ever find enough leather to do so? Even in this case
you would simply wrap your own feet in enough leather to cover the area of
the soles of your feet, in order to keep the thorns and such from hurting you.
This would be comparable then to covering the entire surface of the Earth with

be an impossibility for me to stop every single outer object that might bring me any
kind of pain. Rather I should stop this tendency of my own mind to focus on these
same objects and then feel anger. It is through the constant practice of this
action that I could eventually bring patience to its culmination. Why though
should I try to stop all the other objects, everything that could ever make me
angry? I never could, and there is no need even to try.

Here is the fourth point. Joyful effort as well is something that depends upon
the mind, something that depends on your constant practice of it to bring it to
its final conclusion. Consider the fact that a single small instance of clear and
focused concentration, in which with a joyful state of mind you are practicing
meditation upon something like the first concentration level, can as a result lead
you even so far as a birth in the place of the Pure One (Brahma), or the like.
Along these same lines, an instance of the mind, and the related actions of body and
speech, which are not related to a powerful state of mind are unable to lead to
a desired result, such as the development of the the state of mind of the first
concentration level, if one's efforts are feeble--meaning where one has little joy
in the task. Therefore it all depends on a powerful state of mind.

What it Means to Perfect Meditation

Suppose you attempt every kind of practice
Where you repeat, or do other asceticisms,
Over a long period of time.
If you allow your mind to be distracted
To other objects, then understanding
The true nature is meaningless.

Here is the fifth point. The culmination of the perfection of meditation as well
is something that depends on the mind--a mind which is free of dullness and
agitation, and which is lucid; a mind which is under the constant influence of
thoughts of sadness over this life. Suppose now that you attempt every kind of
practice where you repeat a great number of secret mantras, or asceticisms, such
as fasting or the like, over a long period of time. If you allow your mind to be
distracted to other objects as you do these practices, then you will be unable to
understand the true nature of things.

As the Buddha himself has stated in scripture, "Oh monks! The practices of
asceticism or of recitation, or any of the like, are fruitless when the mind is
distracted to the objects of desire." What Lord Buddha is saying is that
practices done this way are meaningless, in the sense that they can never lead
to the desired result.

What it Means to Perfect Wisdom

MCHOG,SEMS KYI GSANG 'DI MA SHES NA,
,BDE THOB SDUG BSNGAL GZHOM 'DOD KYANG ,
,DE DAG DON MED GYI NAR 'KHYAM,
Suppose any particular person fails
To understand this secret of the mind;
The highest import, the principal teaching.
They may hope to reach bliss and smash all suffering,
But will wander nonetheless, just as they
Always have, without reaching their goal.

Here is the sixth point. Wisdom is also something that depends upon the
mind. Suppose any particular person fails to understand this secret of the mind,
ultimate reality, because they are no proper vessel for being taught the highest
import of all, the principal instruction of this teaching. It may be the case that
they hope to reach matchless bliss, and to smash all the sufferings of the cycle of
life. They will nonetheless be left without reaching the goal they wish for; they
will be left wandering here and there, wherever, just as they always have been.
Therefore the perfection of wisdom depends on the mind.

17
On Recollection

,DES NA SANGS RGYAS RJES DRAN PA'ANG ,

Because of this, recalling to mind

Here is the first. If any particular person performs the contemplation described
above then, because of this, recalling to mind the high qualities of the Buddhas,
along with those of the Dharma and the Sangha, will also come to him or her
again and again. They will thus be able to develop with ease the practice of
recalling the Three Jewels.
18
On Awareness

,GANG TSE DRAN PA YID SGO NAS,
,BSRUNG BA'I DON DU GNAS GYUR PA,
,DE TSE SHES BZHIN 'ONG 'GYUR ZHING ,
,SONG BA DAG KYANG 'ONG BAR 'GYUR,
Suppose a person reaches a point
Where they're able to keep their recollection
Very solid; where they are able
To use their mind to protect.
At this point it will lead to awareness,
And even should these two
Disappear, they nonetheless return.

Here is the second point. Suppose a person reaches a point where he or she is able
to keep their recollection very solid--is able to use their mind to protect themselves
against mental afflictions. At this point then the recollection will lead this person
to gain a kind of awareness, where they are able to watch themselves and grasp
properly the distinction between occasions when their actions are proper, and
when they are improper. It is also the case that, even should these two attitudes
slip and disappear at some point, they nonetheless return. Therefore the question
of whether one becomes a master of Buddhist practice or not hinges upon how
well one can maintain their recollection and awareness; and thus one should
seek to become a master of these two attitudes.

You should decide:

Here is the first. Whenever one is about to go somewhere, or do anything of
the kind, one should at the particular moment--that is, before anything
else--examine one's motivation: one should decide, "This state of mind has
something wrong with it," or "This state of mind has nothing wrong with it." If
at this point you find that your motivation does have something wrong with it,
then you should apply the appropriate antidote, which is to freeze exactly as you
are, like a bump on a log, and refuse to be moved by something which is not
good.

Here is the first. I should never, at any time, look around from side to side
meaninglessly, with my mind distracted. This is because of the fact that, should
I do so, my mind will get worse. Rather I should be sure to fix my mind on a
virtuous object: whenever I look around, I should always keep my eyes lowered,
looking ahead no farther than the length of a plowshare, [which is explained
in scripture as one armspan].

is, if I find that I have become tired looking this way--then to refresh myself I
should for the time being raise my eyes, and look around.

Here is the third point. When I have started to look around this way, it may
happen that someone comes into my line of vision, and approaches me. At this
point I should look at them and give them a smile, and say, "It is good to see you."
Moreover, as I move down the road it may be necessary to check whether or
not there are any dangers or the like on the way, and in such a case I should
look around me on all sides, again and again.

Here is the fourth point. When I have finished refreshing myself and it is time to

in front of me and in back of me--to see if there is anything there like a cliff--and
then either go, or come, as may be fitting.

My mind is a wild elephant:
I must tie it properly to the strong stake
Of a spiritual object of focus.

To watch that it stays this way,

Next comes the second point, on how to watch one's mind. Here again there
are two divisions: tying the mind to some virtuous object, and checking
whether or not you are keeping your mind one-pointedly fixed upon a virtue
or not.
Here is the first. My mind is an elephant that has yet to be trained, and is still
wild. I must tie it properly to a strong stake; that is, to the spiritual object where
I have promised to keep the focus of my mind, one-pointedly. I must try now
with my every effort to watch that it stays this way, without ever getting loose.

No matter what I will make efforts

With any action first consider,
And then undertake it,
Without thinking of any other.
If you focus your mind on this,
Then for the time being undertake
To practice it alone.
If you keep this way then everything
Will come out perfectly;
Otherwise you will fail in both.
If you follow this too then
The secondary afflictions of failing
In watchfulness will never grow.

One may raise the following objection: "The practice of an ethical way of life
is superior to the practice of giving; how is it then that we are supposed to
leave off the former practice for the latter?" With any series of actions that you
must practice in a definite order, you must be careful to consider carefully
which should come first. Then you should undertake this first action and not
think of some other one.
If you are starting with the practice of giving, if you are focussing your mind on
this, then you should for the time being undertake to practice it only. If you train
yourself this way where there is a path that must be followed in a certain fixed
order, then everything will come out perfectly; whereas if you do otherwise, and
reverse the order somehow, you will fail in bringing both the earlier and the
later steps to their proper conclusion.
There are secondary types of mental affliction which are a kind of failure to
understand the stages of the path, a failure of watchfulness, and if you follow this
understanding of the stages then they will never grow strong within you. As
such you must become a master in understanding the proper order of the
stages of the path.

The power of the virtue
Is so much more powerful
If done all the time,
Motivated by strong enthusiasm,
Only by the antidote, or performed
Towards objects of high spiritual qualities,
Those who've been of great benefit,
Or those who are suffering.

Here is the first. Since the power of the virtue is so much more powerful, I should
exert myself in the following kinds of virtuous activity:
* Giving which is done "all the time," meaning on a regular basis;
* That which is motivated by strong enthusiasm--performed with fierce
good feelings;
* That which is motivated only by attitudes such as a lack of
attachment--by thoughts which provide the antidote for
negativities;
* That which is performed towards the highest objects: objects of high
spiritual qualities such as the Three Jewels or the like, and objects
who have been of great benefit, such as your parents;
* That which is performed towards objects which are suffering--the poor
and the like.

Here is the third. I will perform the perfections of giving and "the rest," meaning
all of those up to wisdom, in such a way that they are heightened ever further;
that is, so they increase in strength. Whenever I engage in the perfections of
giving, an ethical way of life, or any of the others, I should never give up
activities which are of greater virtuous power for those which are of less--I
should rather concentrate my efforts on the greater.
These lines are indicating, by implication, the following: where one is unable
to perform both the action of lesser power and the one of greater
power--where a time has come where one must choose between the two--then
we should give up the deed of lesser virtue to prevent the greater one from
being lost. How do we establish which deeds are greater, and which are
lesser? If for example there is a choice between accomplishing one's own aims
or someone else's aims in this present life--if by bringing about one you would
lose the other--then you should concentrate on others' aims.

Isn't it true though that, because filling the needs of others may require us to
undertake a wide variety of different actions, we might ourselves become
sullied by some bad deeds?"
Those who possess compassion, the Buddhas, see directly even those objects which
are "distant," in the sense of being abstruse. There are certain actions, like the
seven bad deeds of body and speech, which they have prohibited for
listeners--for those who are working primarily for their own aims. On certain
extraordinary occasions though, they have allowed even these same actions to
bodhisattvas; when such persons perform these acts they are not only not a
bad deed, but rather become the accumulation of great goodness.

The Sutra on Skilful Means, the Great Secret, for example mentions the ship
captain named Great Compassion, who killed evil persons and thereby erased
many eons of his future suffering in the cycle of life. There is also the incident
that is stated to have occurred with the Brahmin youth named Karma.
The phrase "those who possess compassion, who see to a distance" can also be
explained as referring to these bodhisattvas--the ones for whom the seven
deeds of body and speech are allowed--themselves. [It should be noted at this
point that the practice of performing one of the seven bad deeds for great
goodness is severely restricted, to those who have been practicing the
bodhisattva path literally for millions of years, and should not be construed as
allowed for others.]

Taking Care of Your Vehicle

,PHRAN TSEGS CHED DU GNOD MI BYA,
,DE LTAR BYAS NA SEMS CAN GYI,
,BSAM PA MYUR DU RDZOGS PAR 'GYUR,
I carry out the holy Dharma
With my body; I should never harm it
For some minor benefit.
If I am able to act this way,
Then I can quickly fulfil
The hopes of every living being.

Here is the second section. My body is a base from which I carry out the holy
Dharma; it is something with which, if I care for it properly, I can accomplish
vast purposes for myself and others. I should never do any kind of harm to it
merely for some minor benefit that it might do for someone else--I should shield
it in the same way I would an open wound. Why is this so? Because if I am
able to act this way, then I can--by using the spiritual leisure and fortune which
I've found--reach the culmination of the practice of the three trainings, and in
this way quickly fulfill the hopes of every living being. As the Four Hundred Verses
says,
We should admittedly view this body
as though it were the enemy;
But all the same it is a thing
we must protect as well.
It is an action which creates
tremendous stores of merit
To live a life of many years
maintaining one's morality.

On the Proper Limits of Giving

,SNYING RJE'I BSAM PA MA DAG PAR,
,LUS 'DI GTANG BAR MI BYA STE,
,CI NAS 'DI DANG GZHAN DU YANG ,
,DON CHEN SGRUB PA'I RGYUR GTANG NGO,
I should never give away my body
With impure thoughts of compassion.
I should no matter what give away
My body, to achieve great goals
In both this and the future.

,GSUM PA NI, BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA' DANG PO NAS LUS LA SOGS PA SEMS CAN LA

Here is the third part. It is admittedly true that bodhisattvas do, from the very
beginning, offer their own bodies and the like to living beings from the very
bottom of their hearts. I should never though perform the asceticism of giving
away the flesh of my body or something of the like to someone who requests it
in a way which involves an impure version of the thoughts of compassion where
I am supposed to cherish others more than myself; that is, in such a way that
I would feel distaste, or regret my offering later, or anything of the like. This
point is expanded upon in the Compendium of Training, where a sutra is quoted
which states that giving away things at the wrong time is the work of demons.
 , RANG NGOS NAS SER RNA SOGS SBYIN PA'I GEGS DANG BRAL ZHING NYES MED DU TSOGS CHEN PO RDZOGS PAR 'GYUR BA'I TSE, CI NAS KYANG TSE RABS 'DI DANG GZHAN DU YANG DON CHEN PO SGRUB PA'I RGYUR 'GYUR BA'I TSE BTANG NGO,
When there comes a time however when I have, on my side, freed myself from
stinginess and other obstacles to the perfection of giving, and when I could
without any problems thereby accumulate a great deal of virtuous energy, then
I should no matter what give away my body, for this would act as a cause for me
to achieve great goals in both this and all my future lives.

Rules for Giving the Dharma

,MA GUS PA LA CHOS MI BSHAD,
,MI NA BZHIN DU MGO DKRIS DANG ,
,GDUGS DANG 'KHAR BA MTSON THOGS DANG ,
,MGO BO G-YOGS PA DAG LA MIN,
I should not teach the Dharma
To those who have no respect;
To those not ill wearing veils;
Who hold an umbrella, staff, or weapon;
Or who cover their heads with cloth.

,DMAN LA ZAB DANG RGYA CHE DANG ,
,SKYES PA MED PAR BUD MED MIN,
,DMAN DANG MCHOG GI CHOS RNAMS LA,
,MTSUNGS PAR GUS PAS KUN DU SPYAD,
I should not teach the profound
And far-reaching aspects to the lesser,
Nor a woman without a male.
I should follow the behavior
Of respecting all Dharma equally,
No superior or inferior kinds.

,GNYIS PA NI, SNOD MA YIN PA'I BSAM PA DMAN PA LA ZAB PA DANG RGYA CHE BA'I CHOS MI BSHAD PA DANG , SKYES PA MED PAR BUD MED GCIG PU LA YANG MIN NO, , THEG PA CHE CHUNG GI CHOS LTA BU DMAN PA DANG MCHOG GI CHOS RNAMS BZANG NGAN DANG , RIGS MI RIGS DANG , SANGS RGYAS THABS SU 'GYUR MI 'GYUR SOGS SO SOR PHYE NA CHOS SPONG DU GSUNGS PAS, KUN LA MTSUNGS PAR GUS PAS KUN TU SPYAD CING NYAMS SU BLANG BAR BYA'O,
Here is the second. I should not teach the profound and far-reaching aspects of the
Dharma to those of lesser minds, to those who are not fit to receive these
teachings. Nor should I teach the Dharma to a woman alone, without another
male present.

It is further stated that one has committed the bad deed of rejecting the
Dharma if one discriminates between different parts of the teaching, by saying
for example that the teachings of the greater and lesser ways are, respectively,
superior and inferior kinds of Dharma--one better than the other; one more proper
than the other; one a way to enlightenment, and the other not; or anything of
the like. I should therefore follow a code of behavior where I respect all of them
equally, and put each of them into practice.
31
We Must Teach to a Person's Level

,RGYA CHEN CHOS KYI SNOD GYUR PA,
,DMAN PA'I CHOS LA SBYAR MI BYA,
,SPYOD PA YONGS SU DOR MI BYA,
,MDO DANG SNGAGS KYIS 'DRID MI BYA,
I should never take one who is fit
To receive the teachings of the far-reaching
And introduce them to a teaching which is lesser.
Neither should I ever abandon the code
Of behavior, nor abuse the open and secret
Teachings through deceiving someone.
32
On the Fact that Buddhists Should Have Good Manners

,SO SHING DANG NI MCHIL MA 
DAG,DOR BA NA NI DGAB PAR BYA,
,GCI LA SOGS PA'ANG LONGS SPYOD PA'I,
,CHU DANG THANG LA DOR BA SMAD,
I should, whenever I throw out
The cleaning stick, or spit,
Cover them up.
Disposing of urine or anything similar
In water or on a piece of ground
Which others use is rebuked.

,DANG PO NI, THUN MONGS PA'I 'DUL BA'I SDE SNOD LAS GSUNGS PA'I KUN SPYOD RNAMS BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA' RAB TU BYUNG BAS KYANG GNANG BA'I SKABS MA GTOGS BSRUNG DGOS LA GZHAN MA DAD PA BSKYED PA KHYIM PA'I SEMS DPA' KYANG BSRUNG DGOS PAS, KHA 'KHRU BA'I SO SHING DANG NI MCHIL MA DAG DOR BA NA NI SA LA SOGS PAS DGAB PAR BYA ZHING , BSHANG GCI DANG SNABS LA SOGS PA THUN MONG DU LONGS SPYOD PA'I CHU DANG THANG LA DOR BA LHA LA SOGS PAS SMAD PAR 'GYUR BAS DOR BAR MI BYA'O,
Here is the first. Bodhisattvas who have also left the home life must, except
in those cases which are specifically allowed, strictly maintain each detail of the
code of behavior spoken in the collection of scripture devoted to discipline,
which is something shared by both the greater and lesser ways. And even
those bodhisattvas who are still leading the home life must as well maintain
these points, in order to preserve the faith of others.
Therefore I should--whenever I throw out the so-shing stick which I use to clean
my mouth, or whenever I spit--cover them up with dirt or the like. And since
I would be rebuked by the powerful pleasure creatures and other such beings
if I did so, I should avoid ever disposing of excrement or urine, or else mucus
from my nose, or anything similar in water or on a piece of ground which others use
along with me.

,KHA BKANG BA DANG SGRA BCAS DANG ,
,KHA GDANGS NAS NI BZA' MI BYA,
,RKANG PA BRKYANG STE MI 'DUG CING ,
,LAG PA MNYAM PAR MI MNYE'O,
I should never eat with my mouth stuffed,
Nor with noise, or with my mouth open.
Neither should I stick my legs out while I sit
Nor rub my shoulders together.

I should never eat in such a way that my mouth is totally stuffed with the food,
or so that I make a loud smacking noise or anything of the like, or else with my
mouth wide open. When I sit on a Dharma throne or similar seat, I should never
stick my legs out touching the ground, or such. Neither should I rub myself on
my shoulders together, meaning at the same time. It is however no fault if you
rub yourself on your shoulders one at a time.

,BZHON PA MAL STAN GNAS DAG TU,
,BUD MED GZHAN DANG GCIG MI BYA,
,'JIG RTEN MA DAD GYUR PA KUN,
,MTHONG DANG DRIS TE SPANG BAR BYA,
I should never stay in or on
A single conveyance, a single bed,
Or in the same place with another
Who is a woman. I should avoid
Any kind of behavior which might cause
People of the world to lose their faith,
Whether the obvious or the acquainted.

,RTA LA SOGS PA'I BZHON PA DANG , MAL STAN DANG , GNAS DAG TU GZHAN GYI BUD MED DANG , KHYIM PA'I SEMS DAP KYANG NYE DU MA YIN PA'I BUD MED GZHAN DANG LHAN CIG

[As a monk,] I should never stay in or on a single conveyance, something like a
horse or the like, or on a single bed, or in the same place with another person who
is a woman. Even those bodhisattvas who are laypeople should avoid staying
together with women who are not their own relatives.
In brief, I should avoid any kind of behavior which might cause people of the world
to lose their faith, whether it is behavior that is obviously a problem to everyone
everywhere, or whether it is something peculiar to that particular place or time,
and therefore something that I might not already be aware of, but would have
to acquaint myself with.

,SOR MOS BRDA NI MI BYA STE,
,GUS DANG BCAS PAS G-YAS PA YI,
,LAG PA DAG NI KUN GYIS KYANG ,

I should never point something out
With my individual fingers,
But rather use all my right hand,
Right and with respect.
Thus too should I guide
Any person along a way.

,LAG PA SHAS CHER BSKYOD MIN TE,
,CUNG ZAD BSKYOD LA SGRA BSGRAGS PA,

I should never gesture with my hands
In a very animated way, but rather
Move them only a slight bit
And make some type of noise
Or snapping with them.
Were I to act differently though
It would show a lack of control.

,MGON PO MYA NGAN 'DAS GZIMS LTAR,
,'DOD PA'I PHYOGS SU NYAL BAR BYA,
,SHES BZHIN MYUR DU LDANG SEMS LA,
,THOG MA NYID DU NGES PAR SBYAR,
I should sleep in the desired direction,
In the way the Savior laid down in "nirvana,"
With awareness from the very beginning
I should be sure to rise up quickly.

Here is the third. Whenever I go to sleep, I should emulate the way that the
Savior acted when he laid down and pretended to pass into "nirvana." That is,
I should first lie with my head in the desired direction. Then I should lay with
my right side down, and place my left leg atop my right. I should put my
head down on my right hand, and wrap myself nicely in my dharma robes,
and sleep.
As I go off to sleep I should place my mind on a virtuous object, and utilize
the attitudes of recollection and awareness. From the very beginning, as sleep
comes, I should be sure to keep a very luminous state of mind, where light fills
my mind, and I should reflect upon how I will rise up from my sleep quickly.
As I drift off I should think of how I am about to sustain my body with the
sleep, and then afterwards make great efforts in performing virtuous deeds.

On Doing What We Can

,BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA'I SPYOD PA

,SEMS SBYANG BA YI SPYOD PA NI,

The different types of activities

I must acquaint my mind with them,
And practice til the time arrives,
As it surely will, when I can
Put them in my own life.
