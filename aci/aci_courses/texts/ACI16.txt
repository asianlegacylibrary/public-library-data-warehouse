Course XVI: The Great Ideas of Buddhism, Part One
Reading One: The Principal Teachings of Buddhism, Part One
The following selections are taken from The Three Principal Paths (Lam-gtzo rnam-
gsum), written by the incomparable Tibetan master Je Tsongkapa (1357-1419). The
commentary is by Pabongka Rinpoche (1878-1941), who was a teacher of our root
Lama, Khen Rinpoche Geshe Lobsang Tharchin, and also a teacher of the teacher of His
Holiness the Dalai Lama.
1
On the Life of Our Teacher's Teacher
It was at this time that the glorious Pabongka Rinpoche, the author of the
commentary you are about to read, came into my life. Like me he had as a
young man taken his course of studies at the Sera Mey College of Sera
Monastery; in fact, he was from the same house, Gyalrong.
Pabongka Rinpoche was born in 1878, at a town called Tsawa Li in the Yeru
Shang district of the state of Tsang, north of Lhasa. His family were of the
nobility and owned a modest estate called Chappel Gershi. As a child he
exhibited unusual qualities and in his seventh year was taken before Sharpa
Chuje Lobsang Dargye, one of the leading religious figures of the day.
The lama felt sure that the boy must be a reincarnated saint, and even went so
far as to examine him to see if he were the rebirth of his own late teacher. He
was not, but the sage foretold that if the child were placed in the Gyalrong
House of Sera Mey College, something wonderful would happen with him in
the future.
Later on, the youngster was found to be a reincarnation of the Changkya line,
which included the illustrious scholar Changkya Rolpay Dorje (1717-1786).1
The lamas of this line had done much teaching in the regions of Mongolia and
China--even in the court of the Chinese emperor himself--and the name
"Changkya" had very strong Chinese connotations. Already in those days the
Tibetan government and people were sensitive to the pressures put on us by

our powerful neighbor to the east, so the name "Changkya" was ruled out, and
the boy declared to be "Pabongka" instead.
Pabongka, also known as Parongka, is a large and famous rock-formation
about three miles' walk from our Sera Monastery. The very word "pabong"
means in our language a large boulder, or mass of rock. The place is
historically very important for Tibetans, for perched on top of the rock is the
palace of Songtsen Gampo, the 7th-Century king who made Tibet one of the
leading nations of Asia at the time, and who helped bring the first Buddhist
teachings from India.
Until Songtsen Gampo's time, the Tibetans had no written language. The king,
who desired that the great texts of Buddhism be translated into our language,
sent a number of delegations to India with the charge of bringing back a
written alphabet. Many of the young men who went died in the terrible rainy
heat of the Indian plains and jungles, so different from our high Tibetan
plateau, but the minister Tonmi Sambhota finally returned. He proceeded to
create an alphabet and grammatical system that last to this day. And it is said
that he performed this great labor in the palace of Songtsen Gampo, atop the
cliffs of Pabongka.
Pabongka Rinpoche was actually the second Pabongka, for it was finally
agreed to announce that he had been recognized as the reincarnation of the
Kenpo (or abbot) of the small monastery atop the rock. For this reason he was
sometimes referred to as "Pabongka Kentrul," or the "reincarnation of the abbot
of Pabongka." Pabongka Rinpoche's full name, by the way, was Kyabje
Pabongkapa Jetsun Jampa Tenzin Trinley Gyatso Pel Sangpo, which translates
as the "lord protector, the one from Pabongka, the venerable and glorious
master whose name is the Loving One, Keeper of the Buddha's Teachings,
Ocean of the Mighty Deeds of the Buddha." He is also popularly known as
"Dechen Nyingpo," which means "Essence of Great Bliss" and refers to his
mastery of the secret teachings of Buddhism. We Tibetans feel that it is
disrespectful to refer to a great religious leader with what we call his "bare"
name--such as "Tsongkapa" or "Pabongka"--but we have tried here to simplify
the Tibetan names to help our Western readers.
Pabongka Rinpoche's career at Sera Mey College was not outstanding; he did
finish his geshe degree, but reached only the "lingse" rank, which means that
he was examined just at his own monastery and did not go on for one of the
higher ranks such as "hlarampa." The hlarampa level requires an exhausting
series of public examinations and debates at different monasteries, culminating
in a session before the Dalai Lama and his teachers at the Norbulingka summer
palace. It was only after his graduation from Sera Mey, and the success of his
teaching tours through the countryside outside the capital, that Pabongka
Rinpoche's fame started to spread. Gradually he began to build up a huge
following and displayed tremendous abilities as a public teacher. He was not

tall (as I remember about my height, and I am only 5'6"), but he was broad-
chested and seemed to fill the entire teaching throne when he climbed up on
it to begin his discourse.
His voice was incredibly powerful. On many occasions he would address
gatherings of many thousands of people, yet everyone could hear him clearly
(in those days in Tibet we had never heard of microphones or loudspeakers).
Part of the trick of course was to pack the audience in Tibetan-style, cross-
legged on the floor, with the lama on an elevated platform. Still the audience
would flow out onto the porch of the hall, and sit perched above on the roof,
watching through the steeple windows.
Pabongka Rinpoche had an uncanny ability to relate to his audience, and for
this reason he became a teacher for the common man as well as for us monks.
Generally speaking, the majority of the Buddha's teachings as we learn them
in the monastery are extremely detailed, deep and sometimes technical.
Moreover, we use rigorous tests of formal logic to analyze them as we move
up through our classes. These methods are important for gaining the highest
goals of Buddhist practice in a systematic way, and for passing these teachings
on to others. But they were beyond the abilities and time of many of our
Tibetan laymen. The Rinpoche's great accomplishment was that he found a
way to attract and lead listeners of every level.
His most famous weapon was his humor. Public discourses in Tibet could
sometimes go on for ten hours or more without a break, and only a great saint
could keep his attention up so long. Inevitably part of the audience would
start to nod, or fall into some reverie. Then Pabongka Rinpoche would
suddenly relate an amusing story or joke with a useful moral, and send his
listeners into peals of laughter. This would startle the day-dreamers, who were
always looking around and asking their neighbors to repeat the joke to them.
The effects on his audience were striking and immediate. I remember
particularly the case of Dapon Tsago, a member of the nobility who held a
powerful position equivalent to Minister of Defense. Public teachings in Tibet
were as much social as religious affairs, and aristocrats would show up in their
best finery, often it seemed not to hear the dharma but rather to put in an
appearance. So one day this great general marches in to the hall, decked out
in silk, his long hair flowing in carefully tailored locks (this was considered
manly and high fashion in old Tibet). A great ceremonial sword hung from
his belt, clanging importantly as he swaggered in.
By the end of the first section of the teaching he was seen leaving the hall
quietly, deep in thought--he had wrapped his weapon of war in a cloth to
hide it, and was taking it home. Later on we could see he had actually
trimmed off his warrior's locks, and finally one day he threw himself before
the Rinpoche and asked to be granted the special lifetime religious vows for

laymen. Thereafter he always followed Pabongka Rinpoche around, to every
public teaching he gave.
The Rinpoche had never spent much time at the small monastery atop the
Pabongka rock, and his fame soon reached such proportions that the Ngakpa
College of Sera Monastery offered him a large retreat complex on the hillside
above Pabongka. The name of this hermitage was Tashi Chuling, or
"Auspicious Spiritual Isle." There were some sixty Buddhist monks in
residence there, and as I remember about sixteen personal attendants who
helped the Lama with his pressing schedule: two monk-secretaries, a manager
for finances, and so on. The Rinpoche would divide his time between his
quarters here and a small meditation cell built around the mouth of a cave,
further up the side of the mountain.
The cave was known as Takden, and it was here that Pabongka Rinpoche
would escape for long periods to do his private practice and meditations. The
central chamber had a high vaulted ceiling, so high that the light of a regular
fire-torch could not even reach it, and the darkness seemed to go up forever.
In the center of the ceiling there was an odd natural triangle in the rock, which
looked exactly like the outer shape of one of the mystic worlds described in
our secret teachings.
In the corner of this wonderful cave, an underground spring flowed from a
rock--and above it was another natural drawing, this one just like the third eye
that we see painted on the forehead of one of our female Buddhas. By the
way, this "third eye" you hear about is largely metaphorical, and stands for the
spiritual understanding in one's heart. We believed the cave was home for a
dakini--sort of a Buddhist angel--because people often said they saw a
wondrous lady come from the cave, but no one had ever seen her enter.

On the Importance of the Three Principal Paths:
Renunciation, the Wish for Enlightenment,
and the View of Emptiness

Now there is a great highway along which each and every Buddha of the three
times travels. It is the single guiding lamp for living beings in all three lands.2
It is none other than the teaching known as the "Steps to Buddhahood." And
the heart, the very life of this teaching, is the instruction on the three principal
paths.

DE YANG GZHAN DON DU 'TSANG RGYA BA LA SANGS RGYAS KYI GO 'PHANG DE BSGRUB DGOS, DE BSGRUB PA LA SGRUB TSUL SHES DGOS, DE LA CHOS THOS DGOS, THOS PA DE YANG LAM MA NOR BA ZHIG LA BYED DGOS PA YIN PAS   
We would all like to become Buddhas so we could help others; but to do so,
we have to work to achieve this state. To do this though we have to know
how. And to know how, we must study the dharma. The study that we do,
moreover, must center on a path that never errs.
3
Why We Need the Three Principal Paths

We find it in the question that Geshe Puchungwa asked of Chen-ngawa:3
"Let's
say on the one hand that you could be one of those people who has mastered
all five sciences,4
who has gained the firmest of single-pointed concentration,
someone with each of the five types of clairvoyance,5
who's experienced all
eight of the great attainments.6
And let's say on the other hand that you could
be a person who had yet to gain any full realization of Lord Atisha's
teachings,7
but who nonetheless had developed such a firm recognition of their
truth that no one else could ever change your mind. Which of the two would
you choose to be?"

And Chen-ngawa spoke in reply, "My master, leave alone any hope of realizing
all the steps to Buddhahood--I would rather even to be a person who had just
begun to get some glint of understanding, who could say to himself that he
had started off on the first of these steps to Buddhahood.

"Why would this be my choice? In all my lives to now I've been a master of
the five sciences, countless times. And countless times I've gained single-
pointed concentration, even to where I could sit in meditation for an eon. The
same with the five types of clairvoyance--and the eight great attainments. But
never have I been able to go beyond the circle of life--never have I risen above
it. If I were able to gain a realization of the steps to Buddhahood that Atisha
taught, I would surely be able to turn from this round of births."

Real Spiritual Practice

The Seers of the Word in olden days were making the same point when they
used to say, "Everybody's got some mystic being they're meditating about and
everybody's got some mystic words that they're talking about and all because
nobody's got any real practice they're thinking about."8

Therefore those of us who are thinking about doing some really pure practice
of the spirit should try to find one that will take us on to freedom and all-
knowingness. And for a practice to be this way, it should make us masters in
the three principal paths. These three are like the heart, the very life within the
teachings on the steps to Buddhahood. As the all-knowing Lord, Tsongkapa,
once said: "I used the Lamp on the Path as my basic text, and made these three
the very life of the path."9

Now a lama is extremely important at the outset of any attempts at a spiritual
life. As Geshe Potowa said,
To reach liberation, there is nothing more important than a lama.
Even in simple things of this present life, with things that you
can learn just by sitting down and watching someone, you can't
get anywhere without a person to show you. So how on earth
are you going to get anywhere without a lama, when you want
to go somewhere you've never gone before, and you've only just
arrived from a journey through the lower births?10

Therefore you're absolutely going to have to go and learn from a lama; just
reading dharma books is not going to work. There has never been a single
person in history who gained his spiritual goals without a lama, just by
reading books on dharma. And it will never happen in the future either.

Now what kind of lama should he or she be? It takes a guide who knows
every turn of the path just to get you somewhere you can reach in a single
day. For a lama who's supposed to lead you on to freedom and the state of
knowing all things, you're going to need one who has all the requisite qualities.
It's important to find a really qualified lama; it's not something you shouldn't
care much about, because you're going to end up like him--for better or for
worse. The student comes out according to the mold, like those little clay
tablets with holy images pressed into them.

What are the characteristics that make a lama qualified? According to the
teachings on vowed morality he or she should be, as they say, a "source of all

good qualities" and so on.11
This means that the lama should possess the two
good qualities of being steady and wise.12
According to the secret teachings,
he should fit the description that starts with the words "all three gateways well
restrained." According to general tradition--that of both the open and the
secret teachings--the lama should have ten fine qualities, as mentioned in the
verse that begins with "You who have all ten..."

At the very least, your lama must absolutely be a person who has controlled
his mind by practicing the three trainings,13
who possesses a knowledge of the
scriptures, and who possesses actual realizations. As the Jewel of the Sutras
states,
Take yourself to a spiritual guide controlled,
at peace,
High peace, with exceeding qualities and effort,
who's rich
In scripture, with a deep realization of suchness,
a master instructor
Who's the very image of love, and beyond becoming
discouraged.14

The prospective disciple on his part should familiarize himself with these
descriptions of a proper lama's qualifications, and then seek out a lama who
possesses them. Whether the disciple himself turns out to be more or less
blessed with virtues depends on the degree to which his lama possesses high
personal qualities. If the disciple enjoys a relationship with a lama who is
capable of guiding him through the entire range of the open and secret paths,
then the disciple will come to be one blessed, in the sense of having heard
about and gained some understanding of the paths in their entirety. Even just
gaining this general idea of the overall paths represents greater merit that any
other good qualities that the student might possess.

Once the disciple does manage to locate a lama with the qualities described
above, he must rely on him in the proper way. Here there are eight great
benefits a person can gain through proper behavior towards his teacher,
beginning with being "close to Buddhahood."15
There are also eight different
dangers of improper behavior towards one's lama--these are the opposites of
the benefits just mentioned.

BSTEN TSUL LOG PA'I NYES DMIGS KYANG , DGRA NAG GI DKA' 'GREL DU DRANGS PA LAS, , TSIGS BCAD GCIG TZAM MNYAN PA LA,

,SME SHA CAN DU SKYE BAR 'GYUR,
,ZHES DANG ,
We should speak here too of the dangers in improper behavior towards one's
lama. A reference in Difficult Points to the Black Enemy puts it this way:
A person who doesn't treat as a lama
Someone who's taught him so much as a line
Will take a hundred births as a dog
And then be born in the lowest of castes.16

DUS 'KHOR RTZA RGYUD LAS,

,BSKAL PAR BSAGS PA'I DGE BCOM NAS,
,DE SNYED BSKAL PAR DMYAL SOGS KYI,
,SDUG BSNGAL TSOR BA DRAG PO MYONG ,
The root text of the secret teaching on the Wheel of Time states as well:
Seconds of anger toward your lama
Destroy equal eons of virtue collected,
Then bring equal eons in which you endure
The terrible pain of hells and the rest.17

THEG PA 'OG MA'I LUGS LTAR YIN, THEG CHEN GYI LUGS LA DE LAS KYANG YUN RING BA YOD,
Now the length of time in the snap of a finger is itself made up of no less than
sixty-five of what we call "instants of minimum action." If an emotion of anger
towards your lama comes up in your mind for this period, for sixty-five of
these split-seconds, then you will have to stay in hell for a period equal to
sixty-five eons. This by the way is how the tradition of the lesser way describes
it; according to the teachings of the greater way, the period is even longer.18

And there are even more dangers; a person who behaves improperly towards
his lama will, as the Fifty Verses on Lamas describes, suffer even more in this
present life: spirits, various sicknesses, and other such problems will harass
him constantly. In the hour of death, he is tormented by excruciating pain at
the vital points and overwhelmed by terror. Moreover, he dies through one
of the thirteen causes of a premature death--and so on.19

How the Three Paths are Every Teaching

Thus we can say that, within just a single teaching session devoted to this
work on the Steps to the path to Buddhahood, the teacher has taught and the
disciples have heard the essence drawn from every single volume of Buddhist
teaching that exists on this entire planet.

A Master of the Teachings

A person who develops a good understanding of these Steps to the path
reaches a point where he can go to any one of those tsatsa sheds around town
where we dispose of old scriptures and images, pick up any scrap of writing
that he finds there, and know just where it fits into his lifetime practice. When
you go from here to there, meaning from this single teaching on the Steps out
to the mass of the Buddhas' other teachings, the Steps are like a magic key that
opens a hundred different doors. Going from there to here, the total contents
of that mass of teachings has been packed into these Steps.

Having the ability we've just described is, by the way, what we mean when we
say someone has "gained an understanding of the teachings in their entirety."
Therefore too the expression "master of all the Buddhas' teachings" is not at all
meant to refer to somebody who has put together some neither-here-and-
neither-there concoction of all the earlier and later systems, and who is trying
to practice that. This point we get as well from something that Tuken Dharma
Vajra spoke: "Try to mix up all the systems, the earlier and the later, and you
end up outside of both."20

LAM GYI RIM PA 'DIR GSUNG RAB THAMS CAD 'DUS LUGS KYANG SDE SNOD GSUM GYI BRJOD BYA BSDUS NAS BSTAN PAS GSUNG RAB THAMS CAD KYI GNAD 'DUS PA YIN,
When we say here that the entire teachings of the Buddha are packed into the
Steps of the path, what we mean is that every vital point of the teachings has
been expressed through an abbreviated presentation of the topics contained in
the three collections of scripture.

Be Careful What You Learn

CHOS SHIG BYED BSAM PA TSOS LAM MA NOR BA 'DI LTA BU LA SLOB DGOS PA LAS KHYI'I KHA ZAS BZHIN DU GANG BYUNG BYUNG BYA BA MI RIGS TE, 'JAM MGON SA PAndI TAS,
People who have hopes of doing some kind of spiritual practice should study
an unerring path such as this one. It's not right just to practice anything you
can get ahold of, like some stray dog that gobbles down anything he can find.
As the gentle protector, the Sakya Pandita, has said:

,RTA DANG NOR BU LA SOGS PA'I,

,ZHES GSUNGS,
Even in some insignificant business
Over a horse, a gem, or the like,
You check: ask everyone, consider it well.
We see people taking pains like this over
Even the smallest matters of this life.
Gaining the ultimate goal of all our
Countless lives depends on dharma,
Yet we prize any dharma we might come across,
Not checking if it's good or bad,
And act like dogs with a scrap of food.21

That's just how it is--even in every little matter of this present life, like when
you're buying or selling something, you take a lot of care: you do everything
you can think of, you run around and ask other people, you spend a lot of
time thinking over what to do yourself. But no matter how big a mistake you
make with something like this, it's not going to help or hurt you in your future
life at all. If you meet up with a spiritual teaching that's wrong though, you
make a mistake that affects the ultimate goal of all your lives.

The Mark of a True Spiritual Teaching

Now the master translators of old undertook a great many hardships,
journeying afar to the land of India to bear authentic dharma teachings back
here to Tibet. But those in Tibet who followed a mistaken path couldn't live
up to them at all. Really good water should at the end of ends trace back to
some pure snow. Just so, whatever dharma we choose to practice should have
its ultimate origin in something infallible: in the very Lord of the Word, in the
Teacher, in the Buddha.

CHOS KHUNGS MED LA LO STONG DU SGRUB PA BYAS KYANG RTOGS PA TSAD LDAN SNE GCIG MI SKYE STE, MAR 'DOD NAS CHU BSRUB PA DANG 'DRA BA YIN,
You can spend a thousand years struggling to practice some dharma teaching
that has no authentic origin, and you still won't get a single sliver of true
realization. It's like thrashing water to make butter.

Therefore we can say that the teaching we decide to practice should have three
distinguishing features:
1) It should have been taught by the Buddha.
2) It should have been cleaned of any errors: sages must have
brought the teaching to its authentic final form, having
examined it to determine whether any wrong ideas crept
into it after the Buddha taught it.
3) It should have brought true realizations to the hearts of master
practitioners, once they have heard, considered, and

meditated upon it. And then it must have passed
to us through the various generations of an
unbroken lineage.

DE BYUNG NA CHOS TSAD LDAN YIN PAS RANG GI SNYING RUS DANG NYAMS LEN GYIS PHAR MA BSLUS NA CHOS KYIS TSUR BSLU DOGS MI DGOS,
If the dharma we seek to practice has these three characteristics, it is authentic.
We from our side still might fail it, through lapses in our effort and daily
practice, but we need never fear that the teaching from its side will fail us.

We have now reached the third and final of the preliminaries that lead into the
composition of the text. This one consists of a strong encouragement for the
reader to study the work well, and is contained in the next verse of the root
text:
Listen with a pure mind, fortunate ones
Who have no craving for the pleasures of life,
And who to make leisure and fortune meaningful strive
To turn their minds to the path which pleases the Victors.

Here the great Tsongkapa is urging his readers to study the work: "You, you
people who are seeking freedom and have no single moment's craving for the
pleasures of life; you, who want to get the absolute most from the body you've
found, to make your leisure and fortune meaningful; you now are going to have
to train yourself in a path that never errs, a path that never strays, a path that
is whole and complete, the path which pleases even the Buddhas--the one in the
end they advise, a path that is no erring path, a path that is no path that strays,
a path that is more than just some piece or part of a path. And if you want to
train yourself in a path like that, you're going to have to be a student who has
all the requirements of a student; you're going to have to fit the description
from the 400 Verses:

,GZUR GNAS BLO LDAN DON GNYER BA,
,NYAN PO SNOD CES BYA BAR BSHAD,
We call someone a proper vessel for study
Who's unbiased, intelligent, and willing to strive.22

And fortunate ones like you, disciples who have turned their minds to the
dharma, are going to have to listen with a pure mind; avoid in your study those
things which are opposed to its success--the three problems of the pot; rely in
your study on those things which are conducive to its success--the six images
for the instruction."23

Why You Need Renunciation

There's no way to end, without pure renunciation,
This striving for pleasant results in the ocean of life.
It's because of their hankering life as well that beings
Are fettered, so seek renunciation first.

RANG CAG 'KHOR BA LAS THAR BAR BYED PA LA THAR 'DOD KYI BLO SKYE DGOS, DE MA SKYES PAR 'KHOR BA'I PHUN TSOGS LA CHAGS NA 'KHOR BA LAS THAR THABS MI 'BYUNG BA,
Now for all of us to escape from the cycle of life, we have to want to escape.
If we never develop the wish to get out, and we get attached to the good
things of this circle of life, then there will never be any way to escape it.

A prisoner can sit in a jail, but if he never really wants to escape, and never
really attempts an escape, he never will escape. It's the same for us--if we
never try to find some way to escape this cycle of life, the day of our escape
will never arrive. If we work to develop the wish to escape, then surely there
will come a time when we do.

The point here is that, to develop the wish to achieve enlightenment for all
living beings, you must first develop a kind of compassion where you can no
longer bear to see these beings tormented by the sufferings of life. To develop
this, you must develop renunciation over your own situation; there is no way
otherwise you could gain compassion, for it contemplates the situation that
others must face. This too, concluded our Lama, is what Lord Atisha meant
in his gentle rebuke to us Tibetans: "Only in Tibet have they found people with
the wish for enlightenment who haven't yet found love and compassion."24

On Stopping Desire

Leisure and fortune are hard to find, life's not long;
Think it constantly, stop desire for this life.

What we mean by "desire for this life" is this desire for happiness and fame in
this life--where you say to yourself, "If only I could get more of the good
things of life than anyone in the world--the best food, finest clothes, biggest
name, and all the rest." Anyone who hopes to do some spiritual practice must
stop his desire for this life.

How to stop it? You must contemplate the two Steps known as (1) the "great
importance of this life of leisure and fortune, and the difficulty of finding it,"
as well as (2) our "impermanence, the fact that we must die." These thoughts
then will turn back your desire for this life--in your mind, you will give up
on it. The fact that you and I right now never do any spiritual practice--no,
worse, the fact that we try and what we do is anything but spiritual
practice--is all because of our desire for this life. Free of Four Loves, the mental-
training text, puts it this way:

,TSE 'DI LA ZHEN NA CHOS PA MIN,
,'KHOR BA LA ZHEN NA NGES 'BYUNG MIN,
,ZHES GSUNGS PA RED,
No practitioner, a person who loves this life.
No renunciation, a mind that loves the cycle.25

The border that separates spiritual practice from what is not, and the border
that separates real spiritual practice from what is not, is this attitude of having
given up on this life. Practice, in the form of reciting some lines, and the
world may somewhere meet; but there is no way that practice in the form of
giving up on this life will ever meet the world, in the form of happily
participating in this life. There is no way you can keep the world, and still
keep your practice.

This is what the precious preceptor, Drom Tonpa, had in mind when he said
to a certain monk, "It makes my heart glad, uncle, to see you walking round
this holy place to pay your respects; how much gladder would I be, if you did
something spiritual!" And he went on to say the same thing about making
prostrations, and reciting prayers, and meditating, and everything else. So
finally the monk couldn't decide at all what was supposed to be spiritual
practice and he asked Drom Tonpa, "Well then, how am I supposed to
practice?" And the only answer he got was "Give up on this life!"--repeated
three times, and loud.26

In a broad sense we can start with what are known as the "eight worldly
thoughts." These then can be shortened into three concerns of this life: food,
clothes, and a big name. These three are what you have to give up on.

The worst of the three by the way is Big Name. Sages, holy men, great
meditators of the past--even we can say a majority of them--have been able
to live without great food, keeping themselves alive on one of those mystical
practices where all you eat is some tiny pills or the essence of a flower. And
they've been able to live without great clothes too: they sit in deep retreat,
wearing tattered robes covered with dirt--they glue their backs to the wall of
a cave and seal the only entrance. But in the bottom of their hearts they still
crave fame--the Big Name--and they dream that all the local people outside
are talking about what a holy master meditator they are.

There have been many, many sages and scholars and monks who were pure
in their moral lives but misled in this same way. As the great Droway Gonpo
has said,
They go into seclusion, post a sign on the door,
See not a soul, these master contemplators who still
Hope in this life they call me the "Great Meditator."27

As well as,
And so they fill their minds with hopes and plans,
Thoughts that come in everything they do,
And so their spiritual practice goes to waste,
Spirited away by bandit locals.

Take a spear then, strike it into every
Thought that comes for this life, and remember
Should a single spear not hit the mark
Being a sage, saint, scholar, meditator
Cannot close the door to the three lower realms.

Therefore if we want to do any spiritual practice we must quell the eight
worldly thoughts--we must stand neutral, free of both members of each of its
four pairs. "Eight worldly thoughts" is a name we give to the following eight
emotions:
1) Being happy when we acquire some thing,
2) And unhappy when we don't.
3) Being happy when we feel good,
4) And unhappy when we don't.
5) Being happy when we become well known,
6) And unhappy when we don't.
7) Being happy when someone speaks well of us,
8) And unhappy when someone speaks ill of us.
As the Letter to a Friend states,
Oh worldly wise! To gain or not, feel good
Or not, be well-known or not, be spoken of
Well or ill, these are the eight worldly thoughts.
Quell them; let them not come to your mind.28
The great saint Lingrepa has said as well,
In the city of daily concerns in our circle of life
Scurry the waked cadavers of eight worldly thoughts.
This is where you can find the most frightening
cemetery of all;
This is where you lamas should keep your midnight
vigil among the dead.29

The Ten Ultimate Riches

Therefore if a person fails to stand free of the eight worldly thoughts for this
life he will find it hard even to shut the doors to a birth in the realms of
misery, much less do something that's a spiritual practice. To do such a
practice, you must take up the instruction called the "Ten Ultimate Riches"--a
teaching of the masters called the Seers of the Word for quelling the eight
worldly thoughts, and giving up on life. These ten "ultimate riches" are the
following:30
The Four Aims.
The Three Diamonds.
The Three of Being Thrown Out,
and Reaching, and Attaining.

GTAD PA BZHI NI, BLO PHUGS CHOS LA GTAD, CHOS PHUGS SPRANG LA GTAD, SPRANG PHUGS SHI LA GTAD, SHI PHUGS GROG PO SKAM PO LA GTAD PA DANG BZHI,
The "four aims" are,
Aiming your mind ultimately to practice.
Aiming your practice ultimately to the beggar.

"Aiming your mind ultimately to practice" means to practice religion with the
following thoughts: This time I've been able to obtain a good human body and
circumstances; they are extremely hard to find, they are incredibly valuable,
and they include all the necessary leisure and fortune. This is the one and only
time I will have such a life. And it will not be here long; it is absolutely sure
that I will die, I have no way of knowing when my death will come. And
when I die, only this holy spiritual practice will be of any use to me. All the
things and honors I have gathered in this life, every bit of fame I've gained,
everything else of the money and possessions I may have with me, will not be
the slightest help to me.

"Aiming your practice ultimately to the beggar" is like this: Suppose you think to
yourself "But well now, if I stop trying to do what it takes to live well in this
life so I can do my spiritual practice, I'm afraid that I won't even find the bare
necessities for doing the practice: I'll become a beggar." Think then to yourself
this way: "I will undertake any hardship for my practice; and if it means I have
to become a mere beggar, then let me become a beggar. I will find a way to
do my practice, even if I have to live on lousy scraps of food that I beg off
others, and wear any old clothes they give me."

"Aiming the beggar ultimately to death" means never giving up on your practice.
Suppose you think to yourself, "So I try to do some practice, and I turn into a
beggar, because I haven't taken the time to collect even the single smallest
material thing. But then I won't even have what it takes to sustain this human
life. I'm afraid some day I'll die, without enough food, without enough
clothes." But instead you should think this way: "In all my many previous
lives, I've never given up my life for the sake of my practice. If I can die this
one time trying to practice, I might make up for it. And anyway we are all the
same: rich or poor, we all are going to die. Rich people, to get rich, have
collected a lot of bad deeds and will die with them. I, on the other hand, will
accomplish something of very great meaning if I die from the hardships of
trying to practice. So if for my practice I freeze to death, let me freeze. If for
this I starve, let me starve."

"Aiming your death ultimately to some dusty ravine" comes like this: Suppose you
think to yourself, "But there are certain things that I need from now up to the
time I die. If I don't have any money at all, how am I going to get someone
to help me when I'm sick? Who will attend me in my old age? Who will be
there at my deathbed? And who will take care of things after I die--who will
take the body away, and all the rest?" All these kinds of thoughts come under
the category of attachment to the good things of this life. There's no way at
all you can be sure that you'll even live long enough to reach any old age.
Better to go to some lonely mountain retreat, and give up attachment to
anything at all, and think to yourself "Now I'm going to practice, and I don't
care if I die like some stray dog in a dusty ravine, with no one to look after
me, and maggots crawling all over the corpse."

By the way, you need never fear that if you give up on things to practice the
way we've described it above you'll become some poor beggar and starve to
death. It is possible for a worldly person to die of hunger, but absolutely
impossible for a religious practitioner to do so. This is because our
compassionate Teacher, when he reached the state of total enlightenment, still
had merit enough from his past deeds to go and take some 60,000 births as a

"Wheel Emperor"--one of those incredibly powerful beings who rule the entire
world. Instead he took the fantastic power of these deeds and dedicated it to
the food and other necessities that all his future followers might require. In the
White Lotus, the Sutra on Compassion, we hear the following oath from the
Buddha as he first commits himself to reaching enlightenment for the sake of
living kind:

SANGS RGYAS KYIS THUGS BSKYED PA'I SKABS SU, NGA'I BSTAN PA LA CHOS GOS NGUR SMRIG SOR BZHI 'CHANG BA LA YANG BZA' BTUNG BSAM PA BZHIN MA BYUNG NA, BDAG GIS SANGS RGYAS BSLUS PAS SANGS RGYAS MI THOB PAR GYUR CIG, CES GSUNGS PA DANG ,
And in the days when my teachings spread in the world, any
man who wears so much as four inches of the saffron robe shall
find food and drink to his heart's desire. If he does not, then I
shall have cheated the state of Buddhahood. And then may I
lose my Buddhahood.31

Now when we say to "give up on this life," the main thing that you have to
give up is those eight worldly thoughts or attachments, towards the pleasures
of this life. Giving up these thoughts doesn't necessarily mean that you have
to throw away all your material possessions and become a beggar. Holy
teachers of the past have pointed out for us examples of people who succeeded
in giving up on life, and these have included personages of fantastic material
wealth such as Gyalchok Kelsang Gyatso and the Panchen Lobsang Yeshe.32

The great master of all master meditators, Milarepa, has said as well:
If in your heart you wish to keep the holy
practice, son,
Within the very depths of it then find
this thing first--faith,
Never turn and look back once again
upon--this life.
If in truth you'll follow after me,
Your loved ones turn to demons, hold you back;
Do not think them true--cut all the ties.
Food and money are the demons' advance guard;
The closer the worse, give up all want for them.
The objects of the senses are the demons' snare;
"They will entrap me!" stop your craving them.
Your young love is the daughter of the demons;
"She will mislead me!" so be on your guard.
The place you grew up is the demons' prison;
Hard to free yourself from, flee it quick.
You will have to leave it all behind and
go on--later,
Why not make it meaningful and leave it
all--right now?
It will fall down one day anyway, this
mannequin apparition;
Better to use this body now, get off to a
good quick start.
This skittish bird of mind will anyway fly
from the corpse one day;

Better now to soar across some wide
expanse of sky.
If you listen and act upon this one man's
words--of mine,
Then the grace to keep the holy practice,
my boy--is yours.33

No one to weep when I am gone;
If I can die here in this cave

No one to wonder where I went
No one who knows where I am found;
If I can die here in this cave

Then my wishes have come true.34

Now there is one instruction which we can call the very essence of all the
teachings on how to get rid of the eight worldly thoughts of this life. This is
the meditation on one's own impermanence and death. People like us though
must prepare our minds for this meditation by first contemplating how
valuable, and how hard to find, our present life of leisure and fortune is. Then
gradually we will be ripe for the realization of death.

The all-knowing Lord Tsongkapa has said himself,
This body of leisure's more valuable than
a jewel that gives any wish,
And now is the only time you will ever
find a one like this.
It's hard to find, and easily dies,
like lightning in the sky.
Think this over carefully, and come
to realize
That every action of the world is like
the chaff of grain,
And so you must strive night and day
to make the most of life.
I, the master meditator, put this
into practice;
You, who seek for freedom, must
conduct yourselves this way.35

The point here is that, to rid yourself of the eight worldly thoughts and
undertake a spiritual practice which is truly pure, you must gain two different
realizations: first, of how valuable and hard to find one's life of leisure and
fortune is; secondly, of one's own impermanence and the fact that he must die.

Once you gain these realizations, it doesn't matter--the hills can turn to gold,
the rivers into milk, and every man your slave--but to you it's all repulsive,
useless, like a feast set before a sick man vomiting. And it's not enough for
these realizations to come to you just from the outside--from sitting and
listening to someone describe them. They must come from the inside, from
thinking about them yourself. Then they will be firm in your mind, and never
change again.

Finally a life like ours is hard to find from the viewpoint of the "classical
example." Suppose there were a single yoke-like ring of pure gold that could
float upon the surface of the great ocean. The swells of the sea push it back
and forth, in every direction you can imagine. Far down in the very depths of
the ocean lives a great sea-turtle. He is sightless. Once, and only once, in the
span of an entire century he swims to the surface, to poke his head up
momentarily. And suppose the golden ring happens to catch him around the
neck. The odds against it are nearly infinite.

Our case is the same. The teachings of the Buddha pass now and again among
the various planets of the universe. Here are we, blinded by our ignorance.
We are permanent inhabitants of the deepest reaches within the ocean of cyclic
life. A human body, complete with leisure and fortune, will be fantastically
hard to find; the odds against it are almost infinite. But this time we have
found one.

So our life of leisure and fortune is incredibly valuable, and difficult to find;
this is the first and last time we will ever have such a chance. We must now
make the greatest use we can of it. The single highest thing we can do with
this life is to practice the Greater Way.

And we must begin this practice now, right now. Little time remains before
the inevitable death comes to us. We must constantly bring our death to mind;
just some vague awareness that someday death will come, or thinking some
about death, is not enough to really keep your coming death in mind. You
must train yourself, meticulously, in what it is to die.

In our root text, the instruction on how to keep your mind on death is
presented in the words "life's not long." This instruction includes a number of
categories: the benefits that come from keeping your mind on death, the
problems that come from not keeping your mind on death, and how then
actually to keep your mind on death. This last category itself includes the
three basic principles, the nine reasons for them, and the three resolves to be
made because of them--all ending with the meditation on what it's like to
die.36
A person who trains himself in these categories over a long period of
time is able to develop the true attitude of keeping his mind on death, and
then gains the ability to turn back his desire for the pleasures of the present
life. When a person through the process of careful contemplation has
developed this attitude of keeping his mind on his own death and
impermanence, then we can say the virtuous way has taken its root within
him.

Now what we mean by "desire for the future" is the kind of attitude where you
think to yourself, "I hope in my future births I can live like some god-like
being, such as the creatures they call Pure-One and Hundred-Gift, or like one
of those Wheel Emperors who rule the entire world. May I live in some
wonderful state of happiness, in the best of places, with the best of things, with
a beautiful body and everything I wish for at my fingertips." Incidentally, we
also see people who pray to be born in one of the truly pure realms of a
Buddha, where they will never have to suffer and can enjoy everlasting
happiness--but they pray so without any intention of reaching this high state
in order to help other beings. If we really follow this line of thinking to its
end, it would appear that people like this have for the most part simply
slipped into the base desire for future lives.

The Four Principals of Karma

BSAM TSUL YANG SANGS RGYAS KYIS LAS NGES PA'I TSUL, LAS 'PHEL CHE BA, LAS MA BYAS PA DANG MI 'PHRAD PA, BYAS PA CHUD MI ZA BA STE LAS KYI TSUL BZHI'I SGO NAS GSUNGS PA RNAMS ZHIB TU BSAM NA LAS 'BRAS LA YID CHES KYI DAD PA SKYES TE BLANG DOR LAG LEN BYED PA RANG SHUGS KYIS 'ONG BA YIN,
This contemplation is done by considering, very carefully, the four principles
of action which the Buddha enunciated:
1) Actions are certain to produce similar consequences.
2) The consequences are greater than the actions.
3) One cannot meet a consequence if he has not
committed an action.
4) Once an action is committed, the consequence cannot be
lost.
Once a person has gained a well-founded belief in these principles, he will
automatically in his daily life avoid doing wrong things and begin doing right
things.

Where Death Takes You

After you die, your consciousness doesn't just go out like a lamp--you must
take another birth. And there are only two kinds of birth you can take: one of
the births of misery, or one of the happier births. As for which of the two you
do take, you are totally helpless: you must follow the direction of your past
actions. Virtuous actions throw you into one of the happier types of birth, and
non-virtuous actions throw you into one of the three of misery.

DE YANG LAS MI DGE BA CHEN POS DMYAL BA, 'BRING GIS YI DVAGS, CHUNG NGUS DUD 'GROR SKYE, LAS DGE BA CHEN POS KHAMS GONG MA GNYIS KYI LHA, 'BRING GIS 'DOD PA'I LHA, CHUNG NGUS 'DOD KHAMS KYI MIR SKYE BA YIN, DE LTAR YANG DPAL MGON KLU SGRUB KYIS,
Great non-virtuous acts lead you to the hells; medium ones lead you to a birth
as an insatiable spirit; and lesser non-virtues make you take birth as an animal.
Great virtuous acts, on the other hand, bring you a birth as a pleasure-being
in one of the two higher realms; medium virtues make you a pleasure being
of the desire realm; and lesser virtues bring birth as a human in the same
realm.37
As our glorious protector, Nagarjuna, has stated,

,MI DGE BA LAS SDUG BSNGAL KUN,
,DE BZHIN NGAN 'GRO THAMS DO,
,DGE LAS BDE 'GRO THAMS CAD DANG ,
,SKYE BA KUN TU BDE BA

Non-virtue brings all sufferings
And all the births of misery.
Virtue brings all happier births,
And happiness in all one's births.38

DE LTAR NA RANG RE LA DGE BA NI STOBS CHUNG ZHING MI DGE BA NI SHIN TU STOBS CHE BAS 'DI GA'I NGANG NAS 'CHI NA NI PHYI MAR NGAN 'GROR SKYE BA THAG CHOD,
Since this is the case, and since all the virtues you and I have are feeble--while
all our non-virtues are ever so mighty--then if we were to die in our present
condition it's a foregone conclusion that we would take birth in one of the
realms of misery.

Taking our birth in one of these realms, we would meet unbearable sufferings.
As a hellbeing there would be unspeakable heat or cold, our bodies boiled or
scorched, and more. As insatiable spirits we would always be hungry, or
thirsty, in a constant state of exhaustion and fear. As animals we would be
mindless brutes incapable of saying a thing, exploited by humans for their
work or food.

How to Take Real Refuge

DE LTA BU'I NGAN SONG DU MI 'GRO BA'I THABS SU DKON MCHOG GSUM LA SNYING NAS SKYABS BCOL, LAS 'BRAS KYI BLANG DOR LA TSUL BZHIN DU 'BAD DGOS,
There is a way to avoid these births of misery, and this is to turn ourselves
over to the three rare jewels39
for their protection, and do so from the bottom
of our hearts, and strive our best in choosing correctly which actions we should
undertake, and which we should abandon.

SKYABS 'GRO'I BSLAB BYA'I GTZO BO YANG LAS 'BRAS LA BLANG DOR BYED PA 'DI YIN, LAS 'BRAS 'DI MA BSRUNGS NA NGAN 'GROR SKYE BA THAG CHOD CHOD PA RED, DE YANG RANG CAG PHAL CHE BA 'DI CHOS RANG GIS MA SHES PA GCIG PUS NGAN SONG DU SONG BA MIN YANG , CHOS SHES KYANG LAG TU MA BLANGS PA DANG , LAS 'BRAS KHYAD DU BSAD PAS NGAN SONG DU 'GRO BA CHES MANG BA YIN,
This correct decision in choosing our actions is actually the single most
important instruction in the entire teaching on how to go for refuge. Once we
disregard the principles of action and consequence, it's already decided that we
will take our birth in the realms of misery. People like you and I here in this
assembly, mostly monks, are not likely to take one of these lower births simply
because we know nothing of the spiritual teachings. But remember: there have
been absolute multitudes of people like us, who had a knowledge of the
teachings, but who passed to the realms of misery because they could not put
these teachings into actual practice, or because they chose to disregard the laws
of action and consequence.

LAS 'BRAS KHYAD DU BSAD NA MKHAS PA DANG BTZUN PA JI 'DRA ZHIG YIN KYANG NGAN SONG DU 'GRO, LAS 'BRAS 'DI LA NAN TAN MA BYAS NA, MKHAS PA SDE SNOD 'DZIN PA DANG , GRUB PA THOB PA'I RNAL 'BYOR PA DANG , MNGON SHES DANG RDZU 'PHRUL LA MNGA' BRNYES PA YIN KYANG SDUG BSNGAL MYONG DGOS PA,
And we must heed these laws. A man who does not must take a lower birth,
and it doesn't matter how knowledgeable he was, or how saintly. You can be
a sage who has mastered the entire contents of the canon, you can be an
advanced meditator with fantastic spiritual accomplishments, you can have
great extrasensory powers, and ability to perform miracles; but if you cannot
behave with care around action and consequence, you will suffer.

31
Only Good Can Come From Good

DES NA 'DIR LAS 'BRAS SPYIR BSAM PA LA BZHI LAS, RGYU DGE BA BYAS PA'I 'BRAS BU BDE BA KHO NA LAS SDUG BSNGAL MI 'BYUNG , RGYU MI DGE BA BYAS PA'I 'BRAS BU SDUG BSNGAL KHO NA LAS BDE BA MI 'BYUNG BAS LAS NGES PA'I TSUL,
So this brings us to the four most general principles in our contemplation of
actions and their consequences:
1) If the cause involved is a virtuous act, then the consequence it
produces can only be pleasure, and never pain. If the cause
involved is a non-virtuous act, then the consequence it produces
can only be pain, and never pleasure. Thus the first principle is
that actions are certain to produce similar consequences.
32
The Consequences are Always Greater

RGYU DGE SDIG GNYIS CHUNG NGU RE LAS MA BYAS KYANG , 'BRAS BU BDE SDUG GNYIS KA SHIN TU STOBS CHEN PO 'BYUNG BAS LAS 'PHEL CHE BA,
2) The causes involved may be virtuous or non-virtuous acts
which are relatively minor, but the consequences they each
produce--the pleasure or the pain--will be of tremendous power.
The second principle then is that the consequences are greater than
the actions.
33
No Action, No Result

RGYU DGE SDIG GNYIS MA BYAS NA, 'BRAS BU BDE SDUG GANG YANG MI MYONG BAS LAS MA BYAS PA DANG MI 'PHRAD PA,
3) If one never performs the virtuous or non-virtuous action to
act as a cause, he will never experience a consequence of either
pleasure or pain. Thus the third principle: One cannot meet a
consequence if he has not committed an action.
34
Karma Never Just Goes Away

RGYU DGE SDIG GNYIS BSAGS PA DE DGE BA KHONG KHRO SOGS KYIS MA BCOM ZHING , SDIG PA GNYEN POS MA BCOM NA LAS BYAS PA CHUD MI ZA BA YIN,
4) The fourth principle states that once a person has collected a
virtuous or non-virtuous action to act as a cause, once an action is
committed, the consequence cannot be lost--so long as the power of
a good deed, for example, is not destroyed by an emotion like
anger, or a bad deed by applying an appropriate antidote.
35
What it Means to be "Worldly"

'JIG RTEN PA'I YANG DAG PA'I LTA BA ZHES PA'ANG 'DI YIN, 'DI SER SKYA TSANG MAS NYAMS SU LEN DGOS TE, 'JIG RTEN PA ZHES PA DE KHYIM PA SKYA BO GCIG PU LA GSUNGS PA MIN CING , 'PHAGS LAM MA THOB BAR DU TSANG MA SO SO SKYE BO YIN PAS SO SKYE YIN NA 'JIG RTEN PA YIN PAS KHYAB,
You've heard of the correct view that we call the "worldly" one--well this
understanding of actions and consequences is what it refers to. This view by
the way is something that everyone should adhere to, regardless of whether
they're a monk or nun or layman. You should realize that the word "worldly"
in this case is not just meant to refer to people who are still living the secular
life. There is an expression we use, "ordinary people," to refer to any person
who has yet to reach the path of a realized being [or someone who has seen
emptiness directly.] Whatever else we may be, we are "worldly" people so
long as we are ordinary people in this sense.

Let's say you are born as a human; still you must suffer as you come from the
womb. Still you must suffer as your body gets older, day by day. Still you
must suffer when you are ill. Still you must suffer as you die. You must
suffer the pain of missing your beloved family. You must suffer the pain of
encountering your hated enemies. You must suffer the pain of working for the
things you want, and not being able to get them--and on and on.
37
The Six Sufferings

SDUG BSNGAL SPYIR BSAM PA LA LAM RIM CHEN MOR SDUG BSNGAL BRGYAD BSAM PA DANG , DRUG BSAM PA, GSUM BSAM PA RNAMS GSUNGS KYANG DANG PO BRGYAD NI MI LA SBYAR, PHYI MA GSUM MJUG BSDU LA GSUNGS PAS, DES NA SDUG BSNGAL DRUG BSAM PA LA   
Lord Tsongkapa, in his great exposition on the Steps of the path to
Buddhahood, divides the contemplation of life's general sufferings into three
sections. These are contemplating the eight sufferings, the six sufferings, and
the three sufferings. The group of eight though applies more to life as a
human, and the group of three is given as sort of a summary. Here then we'll
speak some of how to do the contemplation on the six sufferings.

   SDUG BSNGAL DRUG NI, NGES PA MED PA'I NYES PA, NGOMS PA MED PA'I NYES PA, LUS YANG NAS YANG DU 'DOR BA'I NYES PA, YANG YANG NYING MTSAMS SBYOR BA'I NYES PA, YANG YANG MTHO DMAN DU 'GYUR BA'I DE, GROGS MED PA'I DE BCAS   
These six are as follows:
1) The problem that life has no certainty.
2) The problem that we always want more than we have.
3) The problem that we have to keep shucking off bodies,
over and over again.
4) The problem that we have to keep going into a new
life, over and over again.
5) The problem that we go up and down in our fortunes
in life, over and over again.
6) The problem that no one can come along with us;
ultimately we are alone.
38
On Wanting Things

LAM RIM LTAR YIN, 'JIG RTEN 'DI NA 'DOD PAS MI NGOMS PA 'DI LAS SKYON CHE BA MI 'DUG CES RGYAL PO NGA LAS NUS KYANG ZHAL CHEMS SU MDZAD, RANG RE RAB BYUNG RNAMS LA KLOG PA THOS BSAM DANG , SPONG BA BSAM GTAN TE BYA BA 'DI GNYIS LAS MED,
These six problems are described at length in the standard works on the Steps
to Buddhahood. We should remember though King Mefeed, whose last words
were "There is no greater evil in the world than the fact that we always want
more than we have."40
You and I are monks, and there are only two things we
should be doing:
Read the holy books, get teaching on them,
contemplate their meaning.
Live a life of rejection, and stay in
meditation.

SPONG BA ZHES TSUL KHRIMS BSRUNG BA LA BYA, 'DI GNYIS LAS MI 'DA' BA ZHIG BYUNG NA MKHAS PA DANG GRUB THOB GNYIS KA 'DZOMS PA ZHIG 'ONG , 'DI GNYIS MED NA DON MANG 
BA, BYA BA MANG BA LA SHOR NAS CHOS GANG YANG MI 'BYUNG , DE YANG 'DOD CHUNG CHOG SHES MA BSTEN PA'I SKYON RED,
Here a "life of rejection" means a life where we keep our morality, and reject
bad deeds. If we can keep from going beyond these two activities, then one
day we can become both wise and realized. If though we neglect these two,
we will lose ourselves to what they call "lots of things to think about and lots
of things to do." And then we won't do any spiritual practice at all. People
make this mistake, by the way, because they are unable to stick to the precept
of "Keep your wants few; be easy to satisfy."41
39
The Three Kinds of Pain

'DIR SDUG BSNGAL GSUM GSUNGS PAS, ZAG BCAS KYI TSOR BA SDUG BSNGAL THAMS CAD SDUG BSNGAL GYI SDUG BSNGAL DANG ,
Since the three types of suffering are mentioned later on in our root text, we'll
describe them briefly. All impure feelings of pain constitute the first type of
suffering: the "suffering of suffering."

ZAG BCAS KYI TSOR BA BDE BA THAMS CAD 'GYUR BA'I SDUG BSNGAL YIN, DE NI DPER NA TSA BAS GDUNGS TSE BSIL BA DANG , GRANGS BAS GDUNGS TSE DRO BA DANG 'GRO SDOD SOGS LA BDE BAR SNANG YANG ,
All impure feelings of pleasure constitute the second type of suffering: the
"suffering of change." We can explain this suffering as follows. When you're
in a place that's very hot, then something cool seems like pleasure. When
you're in a place that's very cold, then something warm seems like pleasure.
The same is true when you've had to walk a long way (sitting would seem a
pleasure), or had to sit for a long time (walking would seem a pleasure).

DE BDE BA RANG MTSAN PA STE NGO BO NYID KYI BDE BA MA YIN TE DE YIN NA DA DUNG JI TZAM 
BSTEN KYANG BDE BA CHE RU 'GRO DGOS PA LA DE MI 'GRO BAR SLAR DE LAS SDUG BSNGAL 'BYUNG BA DE BDE BA RANG MTSAN PA MIN PA'I RTAGS RED, 'GYUR BA'I SDUG BSNGAL YANG DE LA ZER,
None of these things that seem to be pleasure though is pleasure by nature, or
pleasure in its very essence. If they were, then you would feel more pleasant
the more you had of them. But this is not the case, for as you get more and
more of them they too start to give you pain. When this happens we can
understand that they are not pleasure by nature. They are, in fact,
suffering--they are what we call the "suffering of change."

RIGS DRUG GANG DU SKYES KYANG SO SO'I NYER LEN GYI LUS GRUB TZAM NAS DE DANG DE'I SDUG BSNGAL RANG CHAS SU YOD PA NI KHYAB PA 'DU BYED KYI SDUG BSNGAL YIN, NYER LEN GYI PHUNG PO 'DI GRUB PHYIN CHAD TSE 'DI'I SKYE RGA NA 'CHI LA SOGS PA'I SDUG BSNGAL TSANG MA YONG SA'I RTEN BYED, TSE 'DI PHYI GNYIS KAR SDUG BSNGAL GYI SDUG BSNGAL DANG , 'GYUR BA'I SDUG BSNGAL GNYIS 'DREN BYED KYI SNOD LTA BUR BYED PAS NA, ZAG BCAS NYER LEN GYI PHUNG PO'I SKYE BA LEN MI DGOS PA ZHIG MA BYUNG NA TSER MA'I MAL DU NYAL BA LTAR SDUG BSNGAL KHO NA LAS MED,
The third type of suffering is known as the "pervasive suffering, which brings
in more." The point here is that, regardless which one of the six kinds of birth
we take, we take on a body which, by its very existence, comes complete with
its own particular sufferings built in. From the first moment we take the
various impure parts of our being on, from the first moment of their existence,
they provide a basis for all the sufferings we have to look forward to in life:
birth, aging, sickness, death, and all the rest. The impure parts of ourselves are
like a big pot, sucking in the suffering of suffering, sucking in the suffering of
change, in both this and our future lives. We must find a way to stop taking
births, to stop taking on all the impure parts we're made of. Until we do, our
existence will be like lying on a bed of upright needles--never a thing but
pain.

40
What it Means to "Escape"

'KHOR BA LAS THAR ZHES PA YANG LUNG PA GCIG NAS GZHAN ZHIG TU THAR BA LTA BU LA MI ZER GYI, 'KHOR BA NI ZAG BCAS NYER LEN GYI PHUNG PO'I RGYUN NAM CHA DE LA BYA BAS, DE BDAG MED RTOGS PA'I SHES RAB KYIS RTZA BA NAS RGYUN BCAD PA NA 'KHOR BA LAS THAR BA ZHES ZER BA YIN,
When we talk about "escaping cyclic life," it's not like running away from one
country and managing to reach another. "Cyclic life" is precisely the continued
existence of, the very fact of, the impure parts that make us up, the impure
parts of our being that we've taken on. And when the continued existence of
these parts is stopped at its root by the wisdom that realizes that nothing has
a self-nature, this then is our "escape from cyclic life."
41
How to Know When You've Found Renunciation

GSUM PA NGES 'BYUNG DE SKYES PA'I TSAD NI,
The third and final section of our explanation of renunciation describes the
point at which we can say a person has succeeded in developing it; as the next
verse of the root text reads,

,DE LTAR GOMS PAS 'KHOR BA'I PHUN TSOGS LA,
,YID SMON SKAD CIG TZAM YANG MI SKYE ZHING ,
,NYIN MTSAN KUN TU THAR PA DON GNYER BLO,
,BYUNG NA DE TSE NGES 'BYUNG SKYES PA LAGS,
,ZHES PAS BSTAN,
When you've meditated thus and feel not even
A moment's wish for the goods things of cyclic life,
And when you begin to think both night and day
Of achieving freedom, you've found renunciation.
42
Your Pain, and Others'
As the famous verses of The Bodhisattva's Life say,

,SEMS CAN DE DAG RNAMS LA SNGON,
,RANG GI DON DU 'DI 'DRA'I SEMS,
,RMI LAM DU YANG MA RMIS NA,
,GZHAN GYI DON DU GA LA SKYE,
,ZHES GSUNGS,
If people like these have never before
Even in the dreams they dream
Felt such a wish just for themselves,
Then how can it come to them for others?42

DE YANG RANG STENG DU BSGOM PA NGES 'BYUNG DANG , GZHAN STENG DU BSGOM PA SNYING RJE YIN,
Thus we can say that renunciation and compassion are the same state of mind,
just that one is developed by meditating on your own situation, and the other
by meditating on others' situation.

NOTES TO READING ONE
1. illustrious scholar Changkya Rolpay Dorje: An excellent introduction to the
history of the Changkya line has been written by E. Gene Smith and is
included in his foreword to the collected works of the Tibetan sage Tuken
Dharma Vajra.
2. three lands: That is, below the earth (where the serpent- beings and similar
creatures live), upon the earth (where men are found), and in the sky above the
earth (where deities make their home).
3. Geshe Puchungwa (1031-1106) and Chen-ngawa (1038-1103): Source of quotation
not found. Geshe Puchungwa, full name Shunnu Gyeltsen, was one of the
"three great brothers," direct disciples of Lord Drom Tonpa who helped him
found and spread the Seer tradition of the early Tibetan Buddhist masters.
Chen-ngawa, also known as Tsultrim Bar, was another of the three, as was the
great Potowa.
4. five sciences: Classical grammar, logic, Buddhist theory, the fine arts, and
medicine.
5. five types of clairvoyance: Supernormal powers of emanation, sight, hearing,
perception of the past, and knowledge of others' thoughts.
6. eight great attainments: These are to gain "the sword," which allows one to
travel anywhere; "the pill," which enables you to become invisible or assume
any outer form; "the eye ointment," which helps you see minute or very distant
objects; "swift feet," the ability to travel at high speeds; "taking essence," an
ability to live off nothing but tiny bits of sustenance; "sky walk," the ability to
fly; and "underground," the power to pass through solid ground like a fish
through water.
7. Lord Atisha (982-1054): Full name Dipamkara Shri Jnyana, illustrious Indian
sage who brought the teachings of the Steps of the path to Tibet. Author of
Lamp on the Path, a prototype text of this genre.
8. Everybody's got some mystic being... Original source of quotation not found;
it appears also in Pabongka Rinpoche's Liberation in Our Hands. The Seers of
the Word were an eminent group of early Buddhist masters in Tibet whose
lineage descended from Lord Atisha and his principal disciple, Lord Drom
Tonpa. The school's name in Tibetan, "Kadampa," is explained as meaning that
they were able to see the Word of the Buddha (ka) as personal instruction (dam)
that applied immediately to their own practice.

9. I used the "Lamp on the Path": The full context of this quotation appears in
Pabongka Rinpoche's Liberation in Our Hands; it reveals much of the sources of
our text and restates its comprehensive nature. Lord Tsongkapa has just
related the contents of a major section of his massive Greater Steps on the Path
to Buddhahood to his divine mentor, Gentle Voice. And then,
Gentle Voice asked the Lord in a playful way,"Well now, is there
anything in your work that isn't covered in those three principal
paths I taught you?"
Lord Tsongkapa replied, "This is how I composed my work. I
took the three principal paths which you, oh Holy One, taught
me, and made them the very life of the path. I used the Lamp on
the Path as my basic text, and supplemented it with many other
advices of the Seers of the Word."
10. To reach liberation... Geshe Potowa (1031-1105), full name Rinchen Sel, was
a master of the Seer tradition and one of the three great disciples of Lord Drom
Tonpa. His Metaphors are an important predecessor to later works on the
Steps. The quotation here is found on p. 14 of Hladri Gangpa's commentary
to the Blue Book, a compilation of the great Potowa's teachings written out by
his student Geshe Dolpa.
11. source of good qualities: Opening words of a supplication from a famed
devotional text, the Offering to Lamas, by the venered Lobsang Chukyi Gyeltsen,
first of the illustrious Panchen Lamas of Tibet. The three verses mentioned
here read as follows:
Source of all good qualities, great sea
of morality;
Brimming with a mass of jewels, teachings
you have learned;
My lord, second Lord of the Able, wearing
a saffron robe;
I seek you blessing, master who keeps
the knowledge of the vows.
You who have all ten qualities that one
must possess to be
Worthy to teach the path of all those
who have gone to bliss;

Lord of the dharma, regent standing in
for every Victor;
I seek your blessing, spiritual guide
for the greater way.
All three gateways well restrained, wise,
and patient, and straight;
Free of guile, deception; learned in
the secrets and their texts;
Master at writing and edifying two tens
of secret lore;
I seek your blessing, first among all of
those who hold the diamond.
"Lord of the Able" refers to the present Buddha; the "ten qualities" are listed
in the verse directly following.
12. steady and wise: A Buddhist monk is "steady" when he has kept his vows
pure for at least ten years following his ordination. "Wise" refers to knowledge
of a whole list of subjects in the study of ethics, such as understanding what
is a moral downfall and what is not, or which misdeeds are more serious than
others.
13. the three trainings: These are exceptional morality, exceptional concentration,
and exceptional wisdom.
14. Jewel of the Sutras: A "sutra" is an open teaching of the Buddha. The verse
is from a famed commentary taught to Master Asanga (c. 350 A.D.) by Loving
One, the Future Buddha.
15. eight great benefits: The eight are described as coming close to Buddhahood,
pleasing the Buddhas, overcoming evil influences, avoiding improper activities
and thoughts, reaching high realizations, always meeting teachers, never falling
to the lower realms, and attaining temporary and ultimate goals with ease.
16. A person who doesn't treat as a lama... The quotation is found on f. 161b of
a commentary on the secret teaching of the Lord of Death composed by
Ratnakara Shanti, also known as Shantipa. He was a famed master of the great
Vikramashila Monastery in northeast India during the 10th Century, and
taught Lord Atisha before his journey to Tibet.
17. Wheel of Time: Original source for the quotation not found; it appears in

Pabongka Rinpoche's great work on the Steps of the path, attributed only to
the "Wheel of Time" with no mention of "root text." The root text for the secret
teaching on the Wheel of Time was huge, twelve thousand verses long, and
only abridgements have been included in the Tibetan canon.
18. the greater way: The Buddha gave various levels of teachings for disciples
of different capacities; these are known as the "greater" and "lesser" ways.
19. Fifty Verses on Lamas: Traditional manual on how to behave towards one's
spiritual guide, by the great Buddhist poet Ashvaghosha (c. 100 A.D.). The
thirteen causes of a premature death are listed on f. 10a and explained by Lord
Tsongkapa in his commentary as follows: an unbearable pain in the skull,
injury by various powerful animals, different illnesses, demonic forces, plague,
poison, authorities of the land, fire, snakes, water, spirits, thieves, and fierce
demigods. After dying in one of these ways, the person descends directly to
the hells.
20. Try to mix up all the systems... Source of quotation not found. Tuken
Dharma Vajra, also known as Lobsang Chukyi Nyima (1737-1802), was the
third of the Tuken line of spiritual masters and is famed for his work on
comparative Buddhist school systems, as well as for biographies of saints such
as Changkya Rolpay Dorje, said to be the former life of Pabongka Rinpoche
himself (see the Foreword, and also his collected works.)
21. Even in some insignificant business... Quotation from f. 95a of his famed work
on the three types of vows.
22. We call someone... From a classic text on the teachings of emptiness by
Master Aryadeva (c. 200 A.D.).
23. six images for the instruction: For these and the three "problems of the pot."
24. Only in Tibet... Original source not found. The quotation also appears in the
greater work on the Steps by Lord Tsongkapa.
25. No practitioner, a person who loves this life... Quotation from p. 436 of this
classic "mental training" text of the venerable Drakpa Gyeltsen. The "four
loves" are listed this way:
Love for this life, which makes one
no practitioner.
Love for this world, which is no
renunciation.
Love for one's selfish interests, which
makes one no bodhisattva.

Grasping to a real "me," which is no
correct view.
26. repeated three times, and loud: A full account of the incident is found in the
Collected Sayings of the Seers, compiled by Tsunpa Chegom.
27. They go into seclusion... Source of this and the following quotation not found.
Both appear in Pabongka Rinpoche's Liberation in Our Hands. "Droway Gonpo"
is a name applied to a number of Tibetan sages; Pabongka Rinpoche adds the
word "Gyer" before the name in one instance, but it is still not clear to whom
the quotations are to be attributed.
28. Oh worldly wise! From the famed epistle of spiritual instruction sent by the
great Buddhist philosopher Master Nagarjuna (c. 200 A.D.) to the Indian king
Udayibhadra.
29. In the city of daily concerns... Original source of quotation not found; the lines
appear as well in Pabongka Rinpoche's work on the Steps. It is a practice for
Buddhist meditators to go to some frightening place, like a cemetery or a high
cliff, to observe their heightened sense of a "self" and better understand it.
Graveyards in Tibet and India were especially fear-inspiring because bodies
were simply laid out rather than buried, and this would attract dangerous wild
animals. The great Lingrepa, full name Padma Dorje (1128-1188), was a
student of Droway Gonpo Pakmo Drupa and founded one of the orders of the
Kagyu tradition of Tibetan Buddhism.
30. ten "ultimate riches": We see the roots of these ten riches in the instructions
of Geshe Shawopa among the Collected Sayings of the Seers.
31. And in the days when my teaching... The Buddha's eloquent oath appears on
f. 414. The "saffron robe" is that of a Buddhist monk.
32. Gyalchok Kelsang Gyatso (1708-1757) and Panchen Lobsang Yeshe (1663-1737):
The former was the seventh of the Dalai Lamas, spiritual and temporal rulers
of Tibet. He built the Norbulingka, magnificent summer palace of the Dalai
Lamas, and sponsored a carving of the wooden printing-blocks for the entire
collection of over 4,000 titles in the Tibetan Buddhist canon. The latter figure
was the second of the Panchen Lamas, another exalted lineage of spiritual and
temporal leaders centered at the great Tashi Lhunpo Monastery in
south-central Tibet. He was an eminent practitioner and scholar of Buddhism
while still one of the most powerful political figures of his time.
33. If in your heart... The quoted lines appear on p. 163 of the famous biography
of Lord Milarepa by his disciple Rechung Dorje Drakpa (1083-1161).

34. No way my loved ones know... The lines are found in the section about Lord
Milarepa (ff. 72-100) from the Ocean of Songs of the Kagyu by Karmapa Mikyu
Dorje (1507-1554).
35. This body of leisure... Another quotation from the very brief version of Lord
Tsongkapa's Steps on the Path to Buddhahood.
36. benefits that come from keeping your mind on death, etc.: In his masterwork
Liberation in Our Hands, Pabongka Rinpoche lists six benefits of keeping your
mind on death: your practice becomes really pure; it gains power; the thoughts
help you start practice; they help you strive hard during your practice; they
help bring your practice to a successful conclusion; and in the hour of death
you go with satisfaction, for you know you have spent your life meaningfully.
The Rinpoche also lists six problems that come from not keeping your mind
on death: you neglect your religious life, and spend all your days in thoughts
of what to eat or wear-- this life's distractions; you consider death occasionally
but always think it will come later, and delay your practice; or you do practice,
but for the wrong reason--with hopes of reputation; you practice but with no
enthusiasm, and drop it after a while; you get deeper into this life, your
attitude gets worse, and life begins to hurt you; and at death you naturally feel
intense regret, for you have wasted all your efforts on this present life.
The three principles, for how actually to keep your mind on death, have three
reasons each, making a total of nine. First of all, death is certain: no power in
the universe can stop death when it arrives; there is no way to add time to
your life, you come closer to death every minute; even while you are alive, the
free time available for your practice is extremely limited before you have to
die.
The second principle is that there is absolutely no certainty when you will die.
We are in a time and realm where the length of life is uncertain; we can be
sure we will never have enough time to defeat all our enemies, raise up all our
friends, and still complete our religious practice before we die. The things that
can kill us are many; the things that keep us alive are few. And in general the
body we have is fragile, weak: a small splinter in the hand can give us an
infection that kills us--we are like bubbles, like candles in a windstorm.
The third principle is that, at the moment of death, nothing at all can help us
but our spiritual practice. None of your money or things can help you. None
of your friends or family can help you--they can be holding you tightly by the
arms and legs, but still you will slip away alone. And not even your own
body can help you--you have to give up your most cherished possession, your
beloved body, along with everything else.

The three principles call for three resolves on our part. Knowing that we shall
have to die, we must resolve to begin our practice. Knowing that we could die
any time, we must quit our worldly work immediately and start our practice
today. And finally, since nothing else can help us, we must devote ourselves
to our practice only. A man who is hiking many miles doesn't fill up his pack
with a lot of crap that he won't be needing.
The above points are paraphrased from the works on the Steps of the path by
Lord Tsongkapa and Pabongka Rinpoche. For the last point mentioned in the
text, the meditation on what it's like to die, we quote the Rinpoche directly (ff.
182b-183a):
They try all different kinds of treatments and holy rituals but
your condition gets worse and worse. The doctors start lying to
you. Your friends and relatives say all sorts of cheery things to
your face, but behind your back they start wrapping up your
affairs, because everyone can see you're going to die.
Your body starts to lose its familiar warmth. It's hard to breathe.
The nostrils collapse. The lips curl back. The color starts to
drain from your face. All sorts of repulsive signs begin to show,
inside and outside of you.
You think of all the wrong things you did in your life, and wish
so badly you had never done them. You can't quite be sure if
you ever really got rid of them all when you confessed; or that
you really did any true good deed.
Then comes the final pain, the unspeakable searing pain that
comes with death. The basic building blocks of your body begin
their domino collapse, you are blinded by catastrophic images,
hallucinations of pure terror crowd into your mind, and carry
you away, and the whole world you have been living blinks out.
People take your corpse and wrap it up in a sheet and lay it in
some corner. They hang up a curtain to hide it. Somebody
lights up a smudgy little candle and leaves it there. If you're one
of those reincarnated lamas, they dress you up in you fancy
ritual robes and try to make you look good.
Right now we are all running around trying to arrange ourselves
a nice house, soft clothes, cozy chairs. But you know the custom
here in Tibet--when you die they'll tie your arms and legs up
against your chest with a leather strap, carry the body far from
town, and throw it naked out on the rocks.

Right now we all go home and try to cook ourselves up some
delectable dish--but there will come a day when you stand there
praying for a little taste of those cakes they offer the spirits of the
dead. Right now we have the big name--they call us Doctor
Professor, or Respected Sir, or Your Reverence. But there will
come a day when they look at your body and call you nothing
but "that stinking corpse." There will come a day when the title
they put in front of your name is "the late," or "that guy they
used to call..."
So now when you respected lamas out there in the audience look
at your ritual robes, let it come into your thoughts that these are
the robes they will dress your remains in after you have expired.
And all the rest of us, when we look at our bedsheets before we
go to sleep, should try to remember that these are what they will
wrap our stinking corpse in when we die. As Milarepa said,
That frightful corpse they talk about
Is the very body you wear, meditator.
He means look at your own body now, and always see the future
corpse.
37. the realms: Buddhism teaches that there are three realms of existence. We
live in the "desire" realm, so called because our principal interests are food and
sex. Higher up is the "form" realm, where beings live in a state of meditation
and have beautiful forms. Even higher is the "formless" realm, where beings
are free of gross suffering and have only mental bodies.
38. Non-virtue brings all sufferings... Quotation from f. 116b of the Master's Jewel
Rosary.
39. the three rare jewels: So named because they are supremely valuable and
infrequently found--the Buddha, defined as the ultimate shelter, a being who
has completed the highest possible good for himself and others; the Dharma,
realizations or the end of undesirable qualities within a person's mind; and the
Sangha, or any being who has perceived the true nature of reality directly.
40. King Mefeed: A legendary king of yore who was said to have been born
spontaneously; he was named from the fact that the concubines of his father
competed to breast-feed the miraculous child and thereby become the Queen
Mother. His story is mentioned in many works; see Pabongka Rinpoche's
Liberation (f. 252a), as well as the list in Prof. Edgerton's Dictionary under the
king's Sanskrit name, Mandhata.

41. Keep your wants few... The dictum is expounded upon by the great Buddhist
philosopher Vasubandhu (c. 300 A.D.) in the sixth chapter of his classic
Treasure of Wisdom.
42. If people like these... From the eloquent manual for bodhisattvas by the
Buddhist poet-philosopher Shantideva (695- 743 A.D.).

Why You Need the Wish for Enlightenment

GNYIS PA LA GSUM, SEMS BSKYED DGOS PA'I RGYU MTSAN, SEMS DE BSKYED PA'I TSUL, SEMS DE SKYES PA'I TSAD DO, , DANG PO NI,
We have now reached the second of the four parts in the actual body of the
text. This is an explanation of the wish to achieve enlightenment for the sake
of every living being. This explanation itself will include three sections: why
you need the wish for enlightenment, how to go about developing this wish,
and how to know when you've finally developed it. The next verse of the root
text tells us why we need this great wish:

,NGES 'BYUNG DE YANG RNAM DAG SEMS BSKYED KYIS,

Renunciation though can never bring
The total bliss of matchless Buddhahood
Unless it's bound by the purest wish; and so,
The wise seek the high wish for enlightenment.

You may be able to gain some fierce feelings of renunciation as we described
it above; any good deeds you do under their influence though can only bring
you an ordinary nirvana--they alone can never serve to bring you to
omniscient enlightenment. We can see this from the fact that even
practicioners of lower paths--people we call "listeners" and "self-made
victors"--can possess true renunciation.43

For full enlightenment then a person needs to develop within his mind all
three of the principal paths--and more specifically, he must have gained the
second path: the wish to achieve enlightenment for every living being. You
may possess extra-sensory powers, you may be able to perform miracles, you
may have any number of fantastic qualities--but unless you have this precious
jewel in your heart, you will never enter that select group of people who
practice the greater way. Without this highest wish, none of your qualities will
ever bring you total bliss--none of them, none of them at all, will bring you
Buddhahood: the ability to free each and every living being from all the
troubles of cyclic life, and from those of a lower escape from cyclic life.44

If you do gain this great wish, you become a person who truly deserves to
have the entire world--with all its different kinds of beings up to humans and
gods--bow down at your feet, just as holy books like The Bodhisattva's Life, and
Entering the Middle Way, and The Rare Stack describe it.45
You find yourself in
a different class of being, and then you completely outshine listeners and self-
made victors--practitioners of the lower paths. Every virtuous act you do,
even down to throwing a scrap of food to some wild bird, becomes a practice
of the greater way; becomes a cause for your future Buddhahood; becomes the
way of life of a bodhisattva.

If a person possesses this holy wish to achieve enlightenment for the sake of
every living being, then all the countless Buddhas in all the ten directions of
space look upon him as their son. And all the great bodhisattvas look upon
him as their brother.

But that's not all; the whole question of whether you have reached the greater
way, and the whole question of whether you will be able to achieve
Buddhahood in this one short life, depend on whether you have truly gained
this wish. So if you want enlightenment, our Lama concluded, you must train
your thoughts in the wish.

They're swept along on four fierce river currents,
Chained up tight in past deeds, hard to undo,
Stuffed in a steel cage of grasping "self,"
Smothered in the pitch-black ignorance.
In a limitless round they're born, and in
their births
Are tortured by three sufferings without a break;
Think how your mothers feel, think of what's
happening
To them: try to develop this highest wish.

The Actual Steps
Here in the teachings of the Buddha there are two methods given for training
one's mind in this precious jewel, the wish for enlightenment. The first is
known as the "seven-part, cause-and-effect instruction." The second we call
"exchanging self and others." No matter which of the two you use to train
your mind, you can definitely gain the wish for enlightenment. The way to
train oneself in the wish, the way which is complete and which never errs, the
way unmatched by any other here upon this earth, is the instruction of the
Steps of the path to Buddhahood, the very essence of all the teachings of our
gentle protector, the great Tsongkapa. Thus you should train your mind in the
wish for enlightenment by using this very instruction.

'BRAS BU DANG , SNYING RJE CHEN PO'I RGYU YIN,
Here we'll give just a brief summary of how one trains himself in the wish to
achieve enlightenment for every living being. The start-off is to practice
feelings of neutrality towards all beings; after that, one begins meditation on
each of the steps from "mother recognition" on up. The first three steps are to
recognize all beings as one's mothers, to feel gratitude for their kindness, and
to wish to repay that kindness. These three act as a cause for what we call
"beautiful" loving-kindness. This type of loving-kindness is itself the fourth
step; it is both an effect brought about by the first three, and a cause for the
fifth: great compassion.

BYANG CHUB KYI SEMS SHUGS DRAG YOD MED KYANG SNYING RJE CHEN PO SHUGS CHE CHUNG GIS 'BYUNG BA YIN, SNYING RJE MA SKYES NA SKYE BA'I THABS BLA MA SPYAN RAS GZIGS KYI RNAL 'BYOR BSGOM, GSOL BA 'DEBS, SPYAN RAS GZIGS KYI THUGS DANG RANG SEMS DBYER MED DU BSRE BA'I RNAL 'BYOR LA 'BAD NA BYIN RLABS ZHUGS TE SNYING RJE CHEN PO SKYE BA LA KHYAD CHE BA MAN NGAG YIN, ZAB GNAD GZHAN 'GA' RE YOD KYANG TSOGS SU MI 'CHAD GSUNGS,
The relative intensity of one's wish for enlightenment depends on the intensity
of one's feeling of great compassion. If you find it difficult to develop
compassion, you can practice the meditation known as "Lama Loving-Gaze" to
help you gain it. If you make good efforts to perform this meditation and the
proper supplications, as well as the practice where you visualize that your
mind and that of Loving-Gaze are mixed inseparably, then you can gain a
blessing for it.47
This is a very special personal instruction for developing great
compassion. There were, our Lama explained, a number of other profound
points in this regard--but he would not detail them in a public gathering.

SNYING RJE CHEN PO SKYES PA NA GZHAN DON KHUR DU 'KHYER BA'I LHAG BSAM SKYE, DE LAS BYANG CHUB KYI SEMS SKYE BA YIN,
Once you develop great compassion, then you can develop the extraordinary
form of personal responsibility, where you take upon yourself the load of
working for others' benefit. And the wish to achieve enlightenment for every
living being comes from this.

The meditation on neutrality goes like this. First you put your thoughts in an
even state, free of feelings of like and dislike, by thinking about someone who
is for you a neutral figure: neither your enemy nor your friend. Then you
imagine that two people are sitting before you: one of your best-loved friends,
and one of your ugliest enemies. Next you think very carefully about how the
friend has, in many of your previous lives, taken birth as your enemy and hurt
you. You think too about how the enemy has, in so many of your past lives,
taken birth as your friend and helped you. This puts your mind in the even
state, free of feelings of like and dislike.

You go on then to think about how all living beings are equal in that, from his
own point of view, each one of them wants to be happy. They are equal too
in not wanting pain. And they are equal in that every one has acted as both
my enemy and my friend, many many times. So who am I supposed to like?
And who am I supposed to dislike? You have to keep on practicing this way
until, one day, you gain neutral feelings towards all sentient beings, as vast in
extent as space itself.

The next step is the meditation where you recognize that every living being is
your mother. Gaining this recognition is much easier if you apply the line of
reasoning mentioned in the Commentary on Valid Perception for demonstrating
the infinite regression of one's awareness. We'll present this reasoning here,
in brief.48

Your awareness of today is a mental continuation of the awareness you had
yesterday. This year's awareness is a mental continuation of the awareness
you had the year before. Just so, your awareness over this entire life is a
mental continuation of the awareness you had in your former life. The
awareness you had in your former life was, in turn, a mental continuation of
the awareness you had in the life before that. You can continue back in a
regression like this and absolutely never reach some point where you can say,
"Prior to this, I had no awareness." This then proves the infinite regression of
one's awareness.

My own circle of life then must also be beginningless, and the births I have
taken as well can have no starting point. There exists no place where I have
never taken birth. I have taken birth in every single place, countless times.
There exists no creature whose body I have not worn. I have worn every kind
of body, countless times. Just the lives I have taken as a dog are themselves
beyond any number to count. And the same is true for every living being.

Therefore there exists no being who has never been my mother. Absolutely
every single one of them has been my mother a countless number of times.
Even the number of times that each has been my mother in just my births as
a human is past all counting too.

Developing a sense of gratitude is the next step, and you can start by taking
your mother in this present life. She began her hardships for me while I was
still in her womb, gladly taking it upon herself to avoid anything she felt might
hurt me--even down to the food she ate--treating herself with care, as though
she were sick. For nine months and ten days she carried me in her womb,
looking at her own body as though it belonged to someone else, someone very
ill, and hesitating even to take big steps.

Nothing more than some baby chick with a red-rubber beak still yet to harden.
But she swayed me on her fingertips, and pressed me to her body's warmth,
and greeted me with a smile of love.

With joyful eyes she gazed on me, and wiped the snot from my face with her
lips, and cleaned my filthy shit with her hands. Sometimes she chewed my
food for me, and fed me things like milky porridge straight from her mouth
to mine. She did her best to protect me from any hurt. She did her best to get
me any good.

In those days I had to look to her for everything; good or bad, happy or sad,
all the hope I could have lay in one person: mother. But for her kindness, I
wouldn't have lasted an hour; they could have set me out in the open right
then and some birds or a dog would have come and made a meal of me--I'd
have no hope of coming out alive. Every single day she protected me from
harms that could have taken my life, no less than a hundred times. Such was
her kindness.

And while I was growing up she gathered together whatever I needed,
avoiding no bad deed, and no suffering, and caring nothing for what other
people might say of her. All the money and things she had she handed over
to me, hesitating to use anything for herself.

For those of us who are fortunate enough to be practicing the monastic life, it
was mother who put forth all the necessary expenses, giving without

kindness she has shown us is truly without measure.

And this is not the only life in which my present mother has given this
kindness to me. She has showered me with this kindness, great kindness, over
and over, countless times, in my many lives before. And she is not the only
one; every single living being has been my mother in my past lives, and during
those lives cared for me no less than my present mother does--it is only my
transitions from death to birth that prevent me from recognizing all these
mothers now.

The next step in gaining the wish for enlightenment is to develop a wish to
repay this great kindness. So every living being is my mother, and has given
me her loving care over and over endlessly, for time with no beginning. And
we know from what was described above that they are being swept along by
four great currents, out to sea--to the vast expanse of the ocean of cyclic life.
They are tormented, without a break, by the three types of suffering, and all
the other pains. Their situation is desperate.

And here am I, their child. Right now I have a chance to rescue them from
this ocean of cyclic life. Suppose I simply sit and bide my time, and give no

shameless.

Right now I could give them things that they would be happy to get--food, or
clothes, or beds to sleep on, whatever. But these are only some temporary
happiness within the circle of life. The very highest way of repaying their
kindness would be to put them into the state of ultimate happiness. So let me
decide within myself that every living being must come to have every
happiness. And every one should be freed as well from every form of pain.

Right now it's absurd to say that these beings have any kind of pure
happiness--they don't even have any of the impure kinds. Every single thing
they think is happiness is, in its essence, nothing more than pain. They want
wantables but don't want to know about doing the good deeds that bring
happiness. They want no unwantables but don't want to know about giving
up the bad deeds that bring pain. They act ass backwards: they do what they
shouldn't and don't what they should. And so my dear aged mothers, these
living beings, are made to suffer.

"How good it would be if they could all be free of every pain,

Let these two trains of thought run through your mind; meditate on them over
and over again. Then you will come to feel the very strongest loving-kindness
and compassion.

Some people might come up with the idea that "Why should I take upon
myself this great load, of every living being? There are plenty of Buddhas and
bodhisattvas around to guide them on their way." This kind of thought though
is absolutely improper. It's base. It's shameless. It's as if your mother in this
life was hungry, and parched, and you expected someone else's child to go and
give her food and drink. But it's you for whom she has cared, and the
responsibility of paying her back has fallen only to you.

It's the same with all these living beings, who for beginningless time have
served as my mother so many times, and who in each of these times cared for
me in every way with the kindness of this present mother. Returning their
kindness is no business of anyone else at all, not for some Buddha or
bodhisattva--it is my responsibility, and only mine.

So someone is going to do it--to make sure every sentient being has every
happiness, and never a single pain. It is going to be myself; I'll rely on no one
else. I by myself will see to it that every single being comes to have every
single happiness. And I by myself will see to it that every single being gets
free of every single pain. I will by myself put them into the state of the Lama,
the state of Buddhahood. Meditate strongly on these thoughts; they are the
step we call the "extraordinary form of personal responsibility."

I may be able to develop this noble intention, but the fact is that I'm
completely incapable of leading a single being to Buddhahood--much less
every one of them. Who then has the capacity? This power is had by a fully
enlightened Buddha--only by him, and by no one else at all. If I can reach the
same state, I will by definition have brought both mine and others' benefit to
its perfection. And then every single ray of light that emanates from me,
whether it be an action of my body, or my speech, or my thoughts, will have
the power to accomplish the ends of countless sentient beings.

enlightenment for every living being.

Nowadays when you go up to someone and ask him what his very most
important practice is, he'll tell you he's meditating on one of those powerful
tutelary deities. You don't meet people who say their chief practice is
meditating on the wish to achieve enlightenment for every living being. Much
less, for in fact it's quite difficult to find anyone who even realizes that he
should make this wish his centermost practice.

Elimination Ritual for getting rid of bad spirits, the Golden Tea offering, the

Sheep Spell, the Horse Spell, the Money Spell, the ritual for No More Problems,
the ritual for Stopping Bad Luck at the End of the Twelve-Year Cycle, the ritual
for Preventing the Praise that Others Give You from Turning to a Curse, and
on and on. These are all so bad that they make it look pretty good when a
person can say he's making a central practice out of anything at all associated
with some authentic tutelary deity.49

We also see a number of works gaining some popularity in different localities
that seem to be just anything somebody could think up: the String of Jewels
for those Bound by Blood, the Blade of Gold for Confessing Sins, the so-called
"Dog Sutra," the so-called "Wolf Sutra," the so-called "Fox Sutra," the so-called

"Bear Sutra," the so-called "Snake Sutra," and all the rest. We find though
absolutely no legitimate origin for any of these works.

If you really do need a text to use for confessing your bad deeds, you should
stop wasting your time with fake scriptures and meaningless efforts like these.
The Victors have, in all their open and secret teachings, given us more than
enough appropriate works: the Three Heaps Sutra, the Sublime Medicine Sutra,
the Sutra of the Great Freedom, the Sutra of the Eon of Fortune, and others of the
like.50
It is texts like these, our Lama told us, authoritative texts with a
legitimate origin, that we must use for our study and recitations.

Now there are also some people around who think to themselves, "But I do
have the wish for enlightenment. After all, at the beginning of all my
devotions I recite the 'Buddha-Dharma-Sangha' prayer51
and think about
achieving Buddhahood so I could help every living being." This though is just
expressing a hope that you gain the wish for enlightenment--it's just making
a prayer about the wish. It's not the actual wish itself. If it were, then
developing the wish to achieve Buddhahood would have to be the very easiest
of all the many practices of virtue we are supposedly trying to do. And so,
concluded our Lama, we must rather gain this true wish by putting our minds
through the training described above--one by one through each of the steps,
in order.

This brings us to the third and final section in our explanation of the wish for
enlightenment: how to know when you've finally developed it. This point is
covered with great detail in various works, including both the more extensive
and the briefer presentations on the Steps of the path to enlightenment, which
at this point employ material from the first of the Stages of Meditation.52
To put
it briefly, suppose a mother has watched her beloved child slip down into a pit
of red-hot coals. The fire is searing his body. She cannot stand to see it go on
for a single second. She throws herself forward to pull the child out.

All the living creatures of the universe, all our dear mothers, are burning in the
same way, in the unbearable pain of the three lower realms, and the circle of
life in general. When we cannot stand to see it go on for a single second more,
when we finally feel the true wish to reach total enlightenment, immediately,
for the sake of every living being, well then--our Lama concluded--you can
say you have gained the wish for enlightenment.
51
Why You Need Correct View

GSUM PA YANG DAG PA'I LTA BA BSHAD PA LA LNGA LAS, DANG PO LTA BA BSGOM DGOS PA'I RGYU MTSAN NI,
We have now reached the third of the four parts of the body of the text: the
explanation of correct view. Here there are five sections; the first, which
explains why you need to meditate on correct view, is expressed in the next
verse of the root text:

,GNAS LUGS RTOGS PA'I SHES RAB MI LDAN NA,

You may master renunciation and the wish,
But unless you have the wisdom perceiving reality
You cannot cut the root of cyclic life.
Make efforts in ways then to perceive interdependence.

GCOD PAR MI NUS,
What the verse is saying is this: "Unless you have that very profound correct
view about suchness--unless you have the wisdom that perceives reality, or
ultimate truth--you can strive to perfect renunciation and the wish for
enlightenment (along with all the other 'method' practices) as much as you
please; but you cannot cut the root of cyclic life, grasping to a 'self,' since these
practices alone do not act as a direct antidote for your grasping."
52

Certain non-Buddhist sages can put themselves into a deep, single-pointed
state of meditation--and they attain all eight levels of concentration and
formlessness.53
But they lack the view with which you realize no self exists,
and fail therefore even to reduce their harmful emotions slightly--much less
to eliminate them. As the sutra called King of Concentration says,

,'JIG RTEN DAG NI TING 'DZIN SGOM BYED KYANG ,
,DES NI BDAG TU 'DU SHES 'JIG MI BYED,
,DES NI NYON MONGS PHYIR ZHING RAB 'KHRUG STE,

The worldly meditate on concentration
But it doesn't destroy their concept of a self.
This feeds their unhealthy thoughts, stirs them up,
And ends like the meditation of Udraka.54

DE'I PHYIR 'KHOR BA'I RTZA BA BDAG 'DZIN GCOD PA LA NGES PAR BDAG MED PA'I LTA BA DGOS TE, DE NYID LAS,
Our tendency to grasp to some "self" is the very root of our circling life. To cut
this root we absolutely must gain the view that perceives that no such self
exists. As the same work says,

,GAL TE CHOS LA BDAG MED SO SOR 
RTOG,SO SOR DE BRTAGS GAL TE SGOM PA NI,
,DE NI MYA NGAN 'DAS THOB 'BRAS BU'I RGYU,
,RGYU GZHAN GANG YIN DES NI ZHIR MI 'GYUR,
Suppose you analyze, see the no-self of things,
And suppose you meditate on what you've seen;
It leads you to the result of gaining nirvana--
Nothing else can lead you to this peace.
53
We Must Use the Teaching of Nagarjuna

There's no way to peace for people who've
stepped from the path
Of the system taught by the Master Nagarjuna.
They've lost the truths, the conventional
and the real;
Those who've lost the truths cannot be free.55

The matchless Lord Atisha has said as well:
Nagarjuna's student was Chandrakirti;
The instructions handed down from them
Bring you to see reality, truth.56
You can see then that this profound viewpoint on things is indispensable for
both the open and the secret teachings.

Broadly speaking, there were four great schools of Buddhist thought that came
out of India--the "land of the realized." Members of the Vatsiputriya section
of the "Detailist" school57
assert that what we seek to see does not exist is any
self which is unchanging, and singular, and independent. Other members of
the Detailist school, as well as those of the "Scripturalist" school,58
teach that
what we seek to deny is something that can stand on its own, something which
exists in a substantial way.

The "Mind-Only" school59
says that what we come to realize does not exist is
any case where the subject that holds an object and the object which it holds
are made from any different "substance."60
What we call the "Independent,"
one part of the Middle Way school,61
believes that what we come to refute is
any object that exists in some unique way of its own, rather than being
established as an existent thing simply by virtue of its having appeared to an
unaffected awareness.62

THAL 'GYUR BAS NI, RTOG PAS PHAR BTAGS TZAM MIN PAR YUL KHO RANG GI STENG NAS TSUR GRUB PA DE DGAG BYAR 'DOD PA YIN,
The "Implication" section of the Middle Way school,63
finally, teaches that what
we come to see has no existence is an object which exists from its own side,
rather than simply existing through a concept supplied from our side.
55
What "Interdependence" Really Means

RTEN 'BREL 'JOG TSUL LA DNGOS SMRA BAS NI, RGYU RKYEN LA BRTEN NAS 'BYUNG BA'I RGYU MTSAN GYIS RTEN 'BREL 'JOG PA LAS, RTAG PA LA RTEN 'BREL MI 'JOG,
Different schools have different ways of explaining "interdependence." The
"Functionalist" group64
says that when something is "interdependent," it's
because it has come about through various causes and conditions. This doesn't
allow them to establish interdependence for those objects which are
unchanging, and have no causes.

RANG RGYUD PAS DE LAS 'JOG TSUL CUNG DRAG PA RANG GI CHA SHAS LA BRTEN NAS GRUB PA RTEN 'BREL GYI DON DU 'JOG PAS RTAG MI RTAG GNYI GA'I STENG DU RTEN 'BREL 'JOG,
The "Independent" group has a way of describing interdependence that's a little
bit better. They say that something is interdependent whenever it exists in
dependence upon its parts. They then can establish interdependence with both
changing and unchanging objects: for those with causes and without.

DBU MA THAL 'GYUR BAS NI, 'JOG BYED DE DAG LAS PHRA BA GDAGS GZHI DANG 'DOGS BYED RTOG PA TSAD MA GNYIS LA BRTEN NAS BTAGS CHOS DE 'BYUNG BA LA RTEN 'BREL GYI DON DU 'JOG PAS,
The way the last group, the one we call "Implication," decides that something
is interdependent is subtler than all the rest. They say that something is
interdependent when we have taken two things--a reasonable basis to be given
a name and a reasonable idea to give it a name--and come out with an object
we gave a name.

Now every existent object is a product of something to be given a name and
something else to give it a name. There is not a single atom of anything in the
universe which does not rely on this process--there is nothing which exists
from its own side. I too then am a product: someone has taken two things
together, my body and my mind, and called it "me." I am nothing more than
that. There is no "me" which exists from its own side; there is no "me" which
does not rely on someone taking my body and mind together and granting it
the name. Neither in fact do my body or my mind themselves exist from their
own sides.

We can express all this in the classical form of a logical statement:
Consider all objects, those of the cycle
and those beyond it.
They have none of the true and solid existence
that I hold them to have; they cannot
exist on their own,
Because they are interdependent.

DE YANG RTEN 'BREL ZHES GZHAN LA BRTEN NAS 'BREL BA'AM GZHAN LA BRTEN NAS 'BYUNG NA RANG NGOS NAS GRUB THABS MED PA   
What we mean here by "interdependence" is that all objects are interrelated
with others on which they depend; that is, they occur through dependence on
other objects. This is why there is absolutely no way they can exist on their
own.

We can take for example the way we appoint the chanting master of a
monastery, or the governor of some district, or any similar figure. First there
must be a reasonable basis to be called "chanting master": there must be a
person who is worthy of being the chanting master. Then there must be
someone like the abbot of the monastery who says, "He is now the chanting
master." Until the abbot does so, until the abbot applies the name and the

concept to this person, he cannot be the chanting master--even though he may
have all the qualities you need to be named "chanting master."

If this were not the case, and if the person were somehow the chanting master
from the beginning, all on his own without anyone putting the name or idea
on him, then he would have to have been the chanting master all along--from
the time he lay in his mother's womb. And when he was born, the moment
he came out of her womb, people then should have said, "Here comes the
chanting master!"

But people didn't say it, because getting to be the chanting master depends on
many other factors. We don't call someone "chanting master" until there is a
basis to give the name--a monk who is fit to be chanting master, and until a
person qualified to give him the name hangs it on him, and says "This is the
chanting master." Neither until this time does the person himself think "I am
the chanting master." But once the concept has been applied to him, "You are
the chanting master," then people start to talk about him as "chanting master,"
and he too begins to think "I am the chanting master."

"Well then," you might think to yourself, "if every object is nothing more that
what we label it, then I can go out and call gold 'brass,' or call a pillar a
'pitcher,' and that's just what they will be." But it's not; we do say that things
are just labelled what they are, but for the label to be applied, the basis that
gets it must be a reasonable one for the particular label.

When we apply a label, three conditions must be present. The three are as
follows: (1) the object must be known to a conventional perception; (2) no other
conventional perception can contradict its existence; and (3) no ultimate
analysis can contradict its existence either. All three must be there.

Now here is what we mean when we say that one conventional perception has
been contradicted by another. We can be standing looking at a scarecrow way
off in the distance, and someone next to us says "That's a man over there," and
we believe him. Then someone comes up who's seen for himself that the thing
is a scarecrow and tells us "It's just a scarecrow." Our initial perception of the

thing as a man then vanishes. This is an indication that the basis was not a
reasonable one for the given name.

That's not all--we can go around giving out all sorts of names, we can say
"Rabbits have horns," but that's not going to make the horns exist; there's no
reasonable basis to get the label. Therefore we must have a reasonable,
conventional state of mind that is applying a name to a reasonable collection
of parts which acts as the basis we want to give the name--and which actually
exists.

Here what we call "self" refers to any nature or state objects

existence of this is what we call "no-self."65

Now the conventional "me"--the one that does exist--is only something we've
created with a label, using some basis to take the label and some idea to give
the label. This is what those lines in the ritual for the secret Frightener
teaching are referring to as they start off, "Since every object is labelled, in
dependence..." The same sentiment is expressed, among other places, in the
ritual for the secret teaching of Highest Bliss: "Like an illusion, just labelled
with a concept."

It's just the same when we investigate this idea of "me." Suppose someone
comes up and calls you out by name. At first the "me" that appears to you is
simply the conventional one: you think to yourself, "He's calling me." But then
he says to you, "So you're the thief!" or something like that. Then your "me"
starts getting stronger and stronger; you start thinking to yourself "Why is he
pointing the finger at me? It wasn't me who stole it. They can't blame ME!"
You start saying "me" "me" and the "me" starts looking like a "me" that can
stand on its own, a very vivid "me."

Now we are not denying the existence of the ordinary, conventional "me" that
first appeared to you. Nor are we denying that "me" appeared to stand on its
own, that it appeared to truly exist. We are not even denying the "me" that
appears to stand on its own, the "me" that appears to truly exist. Rather we
are denying that "me" could actually stand on its own, that "me" could actually
exist naturally: we are denying any "me" that could actually naturally exist.

And when you deny this "me," when you see that this "me" does not
exist--when for your this so-vivid "me" that stands out there on his own
without relying on the two of mind and body ceases to be, and all that's left
is simple emptiness of him, then as the sages say you have first found the
"view of the middle way." And then you have found the "path that pleases the
Victors."

Any person who really understands interdependence in the sense that we've

and their consequences--they become more and more important for him.

And this is why. First of all, good deeds lead to pleasure and bad deeds lead
to pain; each cause is connected to its own result--it can never go wrong
somehow and produce the other result. This invariable relationship comes
from interdependence.

Once you understand the sense in which "interdependence" refers to lack of
any natural existence, then you understand by implication that
interdependence in the form of cause and effect is, in a merely conventional
way, entirely proper or infallible. This then allows you to gain a total
conviction towards the laws that govern all actions and consequences--whether
they be those within the circle of life or those that are beyond it.

How to Know When Your Analysis is Still Incomplete

GSUM PA LTA BA'I DPYAD PA MA RDZOGS PA'I TSAD NI,
The third of the five sections in our treatment of correct view explains how to
know when the analysis you are conducting with the view you have is still
incomplete. This point is brought out in the next verse of the root text:

,SNANG BA RTEN 'BREL BSLU BA MED PA DANG ,
,STONG PA KHAS LEN BRAL BA'I GO BA GNYIS,

You've yet to realize the thought of the Able
As long as two ideas seem to you disparate:
The appearance of things--infallible interdependence;
And emptiness--beyond taking any position.

DE LTAR BSGOMS PAS LTA BA'I DPYAD PA RDZOGS NA RTEN 'BREL DANG STONG PA GNYIS GCIG GROGS GCIG TU 'CHAR BA ZHIG DGOS KYANG ,
Let's say you've meditated on the instructions we've given above. You are
directing your view to analyze all phenomena. If your analysis is really
complete, then interdependence and emptiness must appear to you to go hand
in hand, supporting each other.

63

At some point they no longer alternate,

Now here's what we mean when we say that "at some point they no longer
alternate." We take two things: first, the fact that everything about the way
things work, and about good deeds and bad deeds, is perfectly proper, despite
the fact that no single object is anything more than labels, just names.
Secondly there is the fact that, when we try to seek out the thing that got the
name, we find only emptiness: that there is not a single atom of natural
existence in whatever object we have chosen.

The real sages of the Middle Way school make a fourfold distinction: they say
that nothing exists naturally, but not that nothing exists at all; everything exists
merely by convention, but everything exists without existing naturally.

When you've grasped as well as I the essential points
Of each of the three principal paths explained,
Then go into isolation, my son, make mighty
Efforts, and quickly win your ultimate wish.
This verse is a very personal instruction that Lord Tsongkapa, out of deepest
feelings of love, has granted to all of us who hope to follow him. He is saying
to us, "Go first and try to grasp the essential points of the three principal paths
as I have explained them above; do so by listening to teachings on them over
and over again.
"Then use contemplation to gain a recognition of the truth of these points; do
this in retreat, staying in a state of isolation where you cut all ties to this life,
and live according to the principle of having few material wants and being
satisfied with whatever you have--keep your concerns and activities few.
Make mighty efforts at this practice; act quickly, never lose yourself to putting
off your practice; and then win, my son, the ultimate wish of all your many
lifetimes."

We must spend much time in learning, and reasoning out, and then meditating
on the various Steps on the path to Buddhahood. To do this we have to set a
goal for ourselves, for practicing and then fully realizing the three principal
paths: we have to say, "At best, I am going to gain them in a day. If it takes
me a month, I'll consider it average. But at the very least I will see that I have
them within this year."

We should follow the words of Geshe Dolpa, one of the Seers of the Word,
who said:
Steps of the path! Steps of the path!
They all come down to three short words:
"Look far ahead,"
"Think very big,"
"Keep a pace."66

What he meant by the expression "Look for ahead" was that we should set our
sights on becoming a Buddha. "Thinking big" means we should think to
ourselves, "To reach my enlightenment, I'm going to practice absolutely all the
paths, one by one: those of the three increasing scopes, and those of the secret
teaching--the levels of creation and completion."

Now in the worldly side of things, people who know they must die within the
year still make grand plans and act as if they're going to live a hundred. In
the spiritual side of things, you and I are the opposite: we set our sights as low
as we can when it comes to the threefold practice of learning, contemplating
and meditating--even down to the few prayers we're supposedly reciting
daily. We always pick out the easiest practice possible--we always think
small, we think "This is about all I could manage."

But you're wrong: if you really put forth the effort, there's no question that you

Now the words "Keep a pace" mean that you should avoid the kind of practice
where you go back and forth between making fierce efforts at it and then
letting it go completely--laying around and doing nothing. You should rather
keep a steady pace in the effort you give your spiritual practice: let it flow on
constant, like some great river. Do anything in your power, our Lama
concluded, to draw the very essence from this life of opportunity.

NOTES TO READING TWO
43. listeners and self-made victors: Practicioners who have not yet developed the
highest motivation of attaining Buddhahood for the sake of all beings.
"Listeners" are so named because they can listen to the higher teachings and
relate them to others, but not practice thse instructions themselves. "Self-made
victors" can reach their goal without relying on a spiritual guide in this life,
although only because of extensive instruction by countless teachers in their
past lives.
44. a lower escape: This refers to lower nirvana, or the permanent end of all
one's mental afflictions, and is equivalent to Buddhahood if one attains it with
the wish to liberate all beings. Nirvana without this wish is a "lower nirvana."
45. "The Bodhisattva's Life," "Entering the Middle Way," and "The Rare Stack":
This manual for bodhisattvas was written by the Buddhist poet-philosopher
Shantideva (695-743 A.D.). The classic text on correct view by Master
Chandrakirti, the illustrious 7th Century Indian philosopher of Buddhism, will
be covered below with the third of the principal paths. In each case, the
benefits of the wish for enlightenment appear in the opening verses. The Rare
Stack is a separate section of the Buddhist canon containing some 49 different
sutras. One often quoted in explanations of the wish for Buddhahood is The
Chapter of Light Protector; it contains eloquent descriptions of the benefits of the
wish throughout, and the section around f. 237 is particularly relevant here.
46. Were the merit of the wish... Quotation from f. 352b of this teaching of the
Buddha himself.
47. Loving-Gaze: The divine form of the Buddha that represents all his
compassion. The practice mentioned can be learned from a qualified lama.
48. Commentary on Valid Perception: Famed treatise which forms the basis for the
study of formal logic in Buddhist monasteries. It was composed by Master
Dharmakirti (c. 630 A.D.) in explanation of the Compendium on Valid Perception
written by Master Dignaga (c. 450 A.D.), great forefather of the Buddhist logic
traditions. The reasoning mentioned is found in the second chapter, the "Proof
of Infallibility," beginning from line 142 (ff. 108b-109a).
49. the Elimination Ritual, etc.: We have not located the spurious texts listed.
50. Three Heaps Sutra, etc.: These four teachings of the Buddha himself are listed
at entries 39, 21, 33, and 10 respectively.

51. Buddha-Dharma-Sangha prayer: A traditional prayer for refuge and
developing the wish for enlightenment. It reads,
I go for refuge, until I reach enlightenment,
To the Buddha, Dharma, and the highest Sangha.
By the merit of giving and other goods deeds I do
May I become a Buddha to help all living beings.
The Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha are also called the three rare jewels. They
are so named because they are supremely valuable and infrequently found--the
Buddha, defined as the ultimate shelter, a being who has completed the highest
possible good for himself and others; the Dharma, realizations or the end of
undesirable qualities within a person's mind; and the Sangha, or any being
who has perceived the true nature of reality directly.
52. Stages of Meditation: The point is discussed by Lord Tsongkapa at ff. 89-92
of his shorter Steps on the Path, and ff. 191-202 in his longer version. Here a
number of times he quotes the Stages of Meditation, a treatise in three parts by
the eighth-century Buddhist master Kamalashila. Kamalashila is best known
for his successful defense of the Indian Buddhist teaching of analytical
meditation before the Tibetan king Trisong Detsen. His opponents were
Chinese monks who wrongly asserted that meditating on nothing at all would
be of any benefit.
53. all eight levels: Refers to intensely deep forms of meditation that lead to later
births in the eight sections of the form and formless realms, which are still
counted as suffering.
54. The worldly meditate on concentration... The verse is found on ff. 44a-44b of
this famous teaching of the Buddha. The following citation is the next verse
in the sutra, from f. 44b. The wording of the edition available to us is slightly
different, but the intent equal. Udraka was a non- Buddhist sage who woke
from an extended period of meditation and went into a rage because mice had
in the meantime chewed away at his impressive yogi's locks of hair; because
of his anger, he was then born in the hells.
55. There's no way to peace... From the sixth chapter of Master Chandrakirti's
work (f. 205a). Briefly, the "two truths" mentioned are what are usually called
"deceptive truth" and "ultimate truth." Both are valid, and all objects have
both. The dependence of objects (especially in the sense described below, upon
concepts and names) is their conventional or deceptive truth. Their appearance
is "deceptive" because to the minds of normal people they appear to be
something other than what they actually are. The "ultimate" (here called "real")
truth of objects is their lack of non-dependence, and is first seen directly in the
all-important meditative state known as the "path of seeing." Seeing this truth
directly acts immediately to stop the process through which we suffer.

56. Nagarjuna's student was Chandrakirti... The lines are from his work on the
two truths.
57. "Detailist" school: So called because "they devote their study exclusively to
the classical commentary known as Detailed Exposition, or else because they
understand the Exposition's meaning" (the First Dalai Lama).
58. "Scripturalist" school: The name is said to come from the fact that "this
school of philosophers holds that scripture [eg. sutra] is valid, but denies the
validity of classical commentaries such as the Seven Works on Knowledge"
(ibid).
59. "Mind-Only" school: The name comes from the school's assertion that "every
existing object is nothing but part of the mind," although this general
description is further refined by the school.
60. made from any different "substance": That is, come from any different
principal cause or latency.
61. "Independent" part of the Middle Way school: The school is so named because
its followers advocate a middle way which avoids the extreme of thinking
things exist (naturally) and the extreme of thinking things can't exist (if they
don't exist naturally). The "Independents" are one of the two parts of the
school; they believe one must lead a person to the correct view that things are
empty of natural existence by means of taking an independent object and
discussing it in common terms--rather than starting from the person's own
incorrect view and demonstrating the absurdity that it necessarily implies.
These points are illuminated by the great Changkya Rolpay Dorje, said to be
a former life of Pabongka Rinpoche himself, in his Comparative Systems.
62. unaffected awareness: Any normal, "reasonable" perception--the vast majority
of our everyday perceptions; the opposite would be those infrequent cases
where we take something wrong, such as mistaking a moving leaf for a small
animal as we drive a car, or believing in something unreal that we think we
see under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
63. "Implication" section of the Middle Way school: So named because of their
belief that a line of reasoning which implies a necessary absurdity in an
opponent's incorrect view on the subject is sufficient to inspire in his mind the
correct view of the nature of existence.
64. "Functionalist" group: Refers collectively to the Detailist, Scripturalist, and
Mind-Only schools, since all assert that functional things exist truly.
65. Here what we call a self... Quotation from his commentary on the 400 Verses
of Master Aryadeva.

66. Steps of the path! Original source of quotation not found. Pabongka
Rinpoche's Liberation twice credits the three instructions to Gompa Rinchen
Lama (entry 47, ff. 168a, 334a), who is said to have been a student of Lord
Atisha (see Lord Tsongkapa's Greater Steps), and of Lord Drom Tonpa (Blue
Annals, entry 94, p. 264). Geshe Dolpa, full name Marshurpa Rok Sherab
Gyatso (1059-1131) was a student of the great Potowa and compiled his
mentor's teachings into a famed text of the Seer tradition entitled the Blue Book.
68. Don't be a quitter... From the chapter on effort in Master Shantideva's classic.
"Those who've Gone That Way" refers to the Buddhas.

Course XVI: The Great Ideas of Buddhism, Part One
Reading Three: Buddhist Refuge, Part One
The following selections on the Buddhist idea of "taking refuge" are found in the
Analysis of the Perfection of Wisdom, composed by Kedrup Tenpa Dargye (1493-
1568), a famed writer of monastic textbooks from Sera Mey Tibetan Monastery.

The Three Goals of Refuge

Here is the second section, in which we present our own position.

There is a specific reason why the Three Jewels are established as being the
refuges for practitioners of the three classes. From the point of view of cause
refuge, practitioners of all three classes take refuge in all three of the Jewels.
But from the point of view of result refuge, those of the Listener class aspire
chiefly to attain the state of a foe destroyer.

Those of the class of Self-Made Buddhas aspire chiefly to attain that meditative
wisdom where they abide in a meditation of cessation, a state where all the
obstacles of the mental afflictions have been eliminated.

Those of the Greater Way aspire chiefly to attain the Buddha Jewel, one who
possesses that cause within Him which will allow Him to turn the wheel of the
dharma, in its entirety, for disciples of all three classes. This then is the reason
why the Three Jewels are established as being refuges for practitioners of the
three classes.

The Buddha Jewel

The definition of the Buddha Jewel is "That ultimate place of refuge, the one
which has completely satisfied both the needs." There are two kinds of
Buddha Jewel: the apparent Buddha Jewel, and the ultimate Buddha Jewel.

GSUNGS PA'I PHYIR,
This Buddha Jewel possesses eight different fine qualities, beginning with the
quality of being uncaused. As the Higher Line states,
This is the One, the Buddha:
He is uncaused, He is spontaneous,
He is realized by no other way;
He has knowledge, and love, and power;
He has satisfied both the needs.

The definition of the Dharma Jewel is "The enlightened side of truth, either in
the form of a cessation, or in the form of a path, or both." In name only this
Jewel can be divided into two kinds: the ultimate Dharma Jewel, and the
apparent Dharma Jewel.

The definition of the Sangha Jewel is "A realized being who possesses any
number of the eight fine qualities of knowledge and liberation." In name only,
this Jewel can be divided into two kinds: the ultimate Sangha Jewel, and the
apparent Sangha Jewel.

5
Ultimate Refuge

LAM GYI 'GROD PA MTHAR PHYIN PA'I SKYABS, DON DAM  PA'I SKYABS KYI MTSAN NYID,
The definition of an ultimate refuge is "Any refuge where the journey along the
path has reached its final goal."
6
Apparent Refuge

LAM GYI BGROD PA MTHAR MA PHYIN SKYABS, KUN RDZOB PA'I SKYABS KYI MTSAN NYID,
The definition of an apparent refuge is "Any refuge where the journey along
the path has not reached its final goal."

The Meaning of Taking Refuge

YUL GZHAN LA RANG STOBS KYIS DPUNG GNYEN DU RE BA 'CHA' BA'I SEMS PA, SKYABS 'GRO'I MTSAN NYID,
The definition of taking refuge is "Any movement of the mind that acts of its
own accord, and consists of hoping that some object outside of one's self will
be able to render one assistance."

DE LA SGRAS BRJOD RIGS KYI SGO NAS DBYE NA, RJOD BYED TSIG GI SKYABS 'GRO DANG , LTOS PA BLO'I SKYABS 'GRO GNYIS YOD, DANG PO NI SKYABS 'GRO'I TSIG LTA BU YIN,
In name only, taking refuge may be divided into two: taking refuge in words,
the expression of refuge; and taking refuge in thoughts, the reliance on refuge.
An example of the first would be something like the words you use as you
take refuge.

The latter is of two types: ordinary taking of refuge, and exceptional taking of
refuge. The definition of the first is "Any movement of the mind which acts
of its own accord, and consists of hoping that some ordinary type of refuge
will render one assistance."
The definition of the latter is "Any movement of the mind which acts of its
own accord, and consists of hoping that any one or number of the Three Jewels
will render one assistance."

There are five different kinds of this extraordinary taking of refuge: the taking
of refuge which is shared with practitioners of a lesser scope, the taking of
refuge which is shared with practitioners of a medium scope, the taking of
refuge which is shared with practitioners of a greater scope, cause refuge, and
result refuge.

Here are their respective definitions. The first is defined as: "First, you feel a
personal fear for the sufferings of the births of misery. Second, you believe
that the Three Jewels possess the power to protect you from these sufferings.
Finally you have a thought which acts of its own accord: it is a hope, or
something of the type, that some one or number of the Three Jewels will
render you assistance, to protect you from these sufferings.

The second is defined as: "First, you feel a personal fear for each and every
suffering of the cycle of life. Second, you believe that the Three Jewels possess
the power to protect you from these sufferings. Finally you have a movement
of the mind which acts of its own accord: it is a hope, or something of the

to protect you from these sufferings.

they are to be achieved within ones self, will render assistance."

'GRO'I SKYE SGO BCOD PA SOGS KYI DGOS PA YOD PA'I PHYIR, ,
There is a specific purpose for taking refuge in the Three Jewels. A temporal
purpose is that They can provide you the highest form of protection. The
ultimate purpose is to attain the state of enlightenment.
Taking refuge also serves as the foundation for all the different kinds of vows.
When you take refuge, you thereby join the ranks of the "ones inside": you
become a Buddhist. This taking refuge acts as well to slam shut the door to
the births of misery. These and others are the purpose for taking refuge in the
Three.

The Short Definition of the Wish for Enlightenment

DE LTAR BYAS PA LA, GZHAN DON DU RDZOGS PA'I BYANG CHUB 'DOD PA'I 'DOD PA SEMS BSKYED KYI MTSAN NYID DU GO BA,
As such, we can understand the definition of the wish for enlightenment as
"The wish to achieve total enlightenment for the benefit of others."

Here is the section in which we present our own position. The definition of
the greater way's wish for enlightenment is as follows.

First, it is that main mental awareness belonging to the greater way, which is
focussed on achieving total enlightenment for the benefit of others, and which
is matched with a state of mind that is associated with it: the aspiration to
achieve total enlightenment.
Secondly, it is a knowledge belonging to the greater way, which acts as a door
for entering the greater way (or is something of the type), and which is
included into the activity side of the standard division into the two of "view"
and "activity."

Here next are the divisions of this wish. Nominally, the wish can be divided
into the apparent wish for enlightenment and the ultimate wish for
enlightenment. In essence, it can be divided into the wish of prayer and the
wish of engagement. In terms of level, it can be divided into the four types
that begin with "the wish that acts out of belief." In terms of how the wish is
developed, there are three types, starting with the "king's wish."

The following selections on the Buddhist idea of "taking refuge" are found in the
Analysis of the Perfection of Wisdom, composed by Kedrup Tenpa Dargye (1493-

The Definition of Nirvana

`, , GNYIS PA RANG GI LUGS LA, NYON SGRIB MA LUS PAR SPANGS PA'I SO SOR BRTAG 'GOG, MYANG 'DAS KYI MTSAN NYID,
Here secondly is the section in which we present our own position. The
definition of nirvana is "A cessation which comes from the individual analysis,
and which consists of having eliminated the mental-affliction obstacles in their
entirety."
19
The Types of Nirvana

MYANG 'DAS LA SGRAS BRJOD RIGS KYI SGO NAS DBYE NA, RANG BZHIN GYI MYANG 'DAS, LHAG BCAS MYANG 'DAS, LHAG MED MYANG 'DAS, MI GNAS PA'I MYANG 'DAS DANG BZHI,
In name only, nirvana can be divided into the following four types: natural
nirvana, nirvana with something left over, nirvana with nothing left over, and
nirvana which does not stay.

20
Natural Nirvana

RANG BZHIN GYI MYANG 'DAS, RANG BZHIN GYI YUM, RANG BZHIN GYI SHER PHYIN, RANG BZHIN GYI CHOS SKU, DON DAM BDEN PA RNAMS DON 
The following all refer to the same thing: natural nirvana, the natural Mother,
the natural perfection of wisdom, the natural Dharma Body, and ultimate truth.
21
Nirvana With Something Left Over

The definition of nirvana with something left over is: "A cessation which comes
from the individual analysis, and which consists of having eliminated the
mental-affliction obstacles in their entirety, but where one still has the suffering
heaps that are a result of his past actions and bad thoughts." A classical
example of this would be the nirvana found in the mental stream of a listener
who is a foe destroyer, and who has not yet shucked off the heaps he took on.
22
Nirvana with Nothing Left Over

NYON SGRIB MA LUS PAR SPANGS SHING , SNGA MA'I LAS NYON GYI 'BRAS BUR GYUR PA'I SDUG BSNGAL GYI PHUNG PO DANG BRAL BA'I SO SOR BRTAGS 'GOG, LHAG MED MYANG 'DAS KYI 
MTSAN NYID, MTSAN GZHI, NYER LEN GYI PHUNG PO DOR BA'I NYAN THOS DGRA BCOM PA'I RGYUD KYI MYANG 'DAS LTA BU YIN,
The definition of nirvana with nothing left over is: "A cessation which comes
from the individual analysis, and which consists of having eliminated the
mental-affliction obstacles in their entirety, and where one is free of the
suffering heaps that are a result of his past actions and bad thoughts." A
classical example of this would be the nirvana found in the mental stream of
a listener who is a foe destroyer, and who has shucked off the heaps he took
on.
23
Nirvana Which Does Not Stay

SGRIB GNYIS MA LUS PAR SPANGS PA'I SO SOR BRTAG 'GOG, MI GNAS PA'I MYANG 'DAS KYI MTSAN NYID, MTSAN GZHI, SANGS RGYAS 'PHAGS PA'I RGYUD KYI 'GOG BDEN LTA BU,
The definition of nirvana which does not stay is: "A cessation which comes
from the individual analysis, and which consists of having eliminated both
kinds of obstacles in their entirety." A classical example of this would be the
truth of cessation in the mental stream of a realized being who is a Buddha.
24
How to Achieve Nirvana

The nirvana we are describing here is not something that one can achieve by
using any method at all. Rather, you must achieve it with the training of
wisdom, which realizes that nothing has any self nature; this wisdom must be
under the influence of the first two trainings, and with it you must habituate
yourself to what you were already able to realize.

DE SKAD DU YANG , TING NGE 'DZIN RGYAL PO LAS, GAL TE BDAG MED CHOS LA SO SOR RTOG, SO SOR DE BRTAGS GANG YIN SGOM BYED PA, THAR PA MYA NGAN 'DAS THOB RGYU DE YIN, , RGYU GZHAN DAG GIS ZHI BAR 'GYUR MI SRID, , CES GSUNGS PA'I PHYIR, ,
This fact is supported by the King of Concentration, which states:
Suppose you are able to analyze
One by one those things that have no self;
And after that you habituate
Yourself to what you analyzed individually.
This is what then leads you to
Achieve your freedom; nirvana beyond grief.
It is impossible for any other
Cause to bring this peace to you.
25
What Emptiness is Empty Of

The first of these has two sections of its own: a demonstration of why we must
identify what it is we deny, and then the actual identification of this object.
Before a person can develop within his mind that correct view which realizes

emptiness, he must first identify the final object which is denied with reasoning
that treats the ultimate. As the Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life states,
Until you can find what you thought was there,
You can never grasp how it cannot exist.
Suppose that what you sought to deny was the existence of a water pitcher in
a certain place. If before you started you had no mental picture of what a
water pitcher looked like, you would never be able to verify with an accurate
perception that it wasn't there. Here it's just the same. What we seek to deny
is that things could really exist. If before we start we have no mental picture
of what a thing that really exists would be like, then we can never have a clear
idea of emptiness: the simple absence where the object that we deny isn't there.

Here now is the actual identification of the object we deny. Suppose
something were to occur in some way that was opposite to the way that all the
phenomena of physical form and so on exist deceptively. Anything that could
occur this way would be precisely the final object we deny with reasoning that
treats the ultimate. Therefore we must first explain how it is that all the
phenomena of physical form and the rest exist deceptively.
26
Deceptive Reality

'PHRAL GYI 'KHRUL RGYUS MA BSLAD PA'I BLO KUN RDZOB PA'I DBANG GIS BZHAG PA'I RGYU MTSAN GYIS DE LTAR BSHAD PA'I PHYIR,
The second part to the discussion of how things exist deceptively consists of
an explanation of the various scriptural references. First we will give a brief
treatment of these references, and after that talk about how this system
establishes the two truths; this latter step will include an instructive metaphor.
Here now is the briefer treatment.
There is a specific reason why we say that all these phenomena, physical form
and the rest, exist deceptively. They are described this way because their
existence is established by means of a deceptive state of mind, one which is not
affected by a temporary factor that would cause it to be mistaken.
27

GZUGS SOGS KYI CHOS RNAMS BLO GNOD MED LA SNANG BA'I DBANG GIS PHAR BZHAG PA DANG , YUL GYI BSDOD LUGS KYI NGOS NAS GRUB PA'I DPE YANG YOD DE,
There is an instructive metaphor we can use for describing how physical form
and other such phenomena are from our side established as existing, by the
fact of their appearing to a state of mind which is not impaired; while at the
same time these objects of our mind exist on their own side through their own
way of being.

Suppose a magician is making a little piece of wood appear as a horse or cow.
Seeing the piece of wood as a horse or cow comes from the side of the viewer,
by the force of his own mind, as his eyes are affected by the spell of the
magician. And yet the piece of wood, from its side, is appearing this way as
well. Both conditions must be present.
There is a reason why the first condition must be present: the condition of
being established from the side of the viewer, by force of his own mind, as his
eyes are affected by the spell of the magician. If this condition didn't have to
be present, then a spectator whose eyes were not affected by the spell would
have to see the wood appear as the animal, whereas in actuality he does not.
At this same time the second condition, that the piece of wood appear from its
own side as a horse or cow, must be present as well. If this condition didn't
have to be present, then the piece of wood's appearing as a horse or cow

whereas in actuality it does not.

In this same way are the phenomena of physical form and the rest established
by force of a state of mind which is not impaired. They are labeled with
names, through an unimpaired state of mind and a name which is consistent
with what they are.

They do not however exist on their side through their own unique way of
being, without their existence having to be established by the fact of their
appearing to a state of mind that is not impaired. If they were to exist this
way, then they would have to be the ultimate way things are. And if they
were, then they would have to be realized directly by a state of mind which
was not mistaken; by the wisdom of a realized being who is not a Buddha, and
who in a state of balanced meditation is directly realizing the way things are.
In fact though they are not directly realized by such a wisdom.

Suppose a magician makes a little piece of wood appear as a horse or cow.
Spectators whose eyes have been affected by his spell both see the piece of
wood as a horse or cow and believe that it really is. The magician himself only
sees the horse or cow; he has no belief that it is real. A spectator who arrives
later, who hasn't had the spell cast on him, neither sees the piece of wood as
a horse or cow nor believes that it is.
Three different combinations of seeing and believing exist as well with physical
form and other such phenomena. The kind of people we call "common"
people, those who have never had a realization of emptiness, both see and
believe that form and the rest really exist. Bodhisattvas who are at one of the
pure levels see phenomena as really existing during the periods following

emptiness meditation; but they do not believe it. Realized beings who are not
yet Buddhas, and who are in the state where they are realizing the way things
are directly, neither see physical form and other such phenomena as really
existing, nor do they believe that they really exist.

The Implication and Independent branches of the Middle Way school are
identical in asserting that to exist really, to exist purely, to exist just so, to exist
ultimately, and the idea where you hold that things could exist these ways are
all objects which are denied by reasoning that treats the ultimate.
The Independent branch though does not agree that to exist from its own side,
to exist by nature, to exist in substance, to exist by definition, and the idea
where you hold that form and other such phenomena could exist these ways
are also objects which are denied by reasoning that treats the ultimate. They
say that in fact anything that exists must exist these ways, with the exception
of existing in substance. (There is some question though about things that are
nominal.) They assert that any functional thing that exists must exist in
substance.

Neither the Implication nor the Independent branches of the Middle Way
school asserts that to exist as the way things are, to exist as ultimate truth, or
to exist as the real nature of things is the final object which is denied by
reasoning that treats the ultimate; for if something is ultimate truth, it always
exists in all these three ways.

Here secondly is our own position.
Consider the three: basic knowledge, path knowledge, and the
knowledge of all things.
They do not really exist;
For they exist neither as one thing which really exists, nor as many
things which really exist.
They are, for example, like the reflection of a figure in a mirror.

The Jewel of the Middle Way supports this when it says,
The things of self and other
Are free of being purely one
Or being purely many,
And so they have no nature:
Just like a reflection.

Consider these same things.
They do not exist as one thing which really exists;
For they are things with parts.
The one always implies the other, for if something existed as one thing which
really exists, then it could never be a thing which appeared one way but
actually existed in a different way.
They do not exist as many things which really exist, because they do not exist
as one thing which really exists. The one always implies the other, for many
things come from bringing together a group of things that are one.

The implication in the original statement is true, for if something really existed,
it would have to exist either as one thing that really existed or as many things
that really existed. This is always the case, for if something exists it must exist
either as one or as many.

Here is the "Sliver of Diamond" reasoning, for denying that things can come
from causes:
Consider all inner and outer things that perform a function.
They do not arise ultimately,
For they do not arise from themselves, and they do not arise ultimately
from something other than themselves, and they do not arise from both,
and they do not arise without a cause.

These things do not arise from themselves, because they do not arise from a
cause which is such that, if something were the cause, it would have to be the
thing it caused.
They do not arise ultimately from something which is other than themselves,
for they neither arise ultimately from a cause which is other than themselves
and which is unchanging, nor do they arise ultimately from a cause which is
other from themselves and which is changing.
They do not arise ultimately from both the above, because they do not arise
ultimately from either one of them individually.
They do not arise without a cause, because that would be utterly absurd.

RTZA BA'I THAL 'GYUR LA KHYAB PA YOD DE, DON DAM PAR SKYE NA DE BZHI GANG RUNG LAS DON DAM PAR SKYE DGOS PA'I PHYIR,
The implication in the original statement is true, for if something were to arise

possibilities mentioned.

Here is the reasoning called "The Denial that Things which Exist or Do Not
Exist could Arise," which we use for denying that things can come from
results:
Consider results.
They do not arise ultimately,
For results which exist at the time of their cause do not arise ultimately,
and results that do not exist at the time of their cause do not arise
ultimately, and results that both exist and do not exist at the time of
their cause do not arise ultimately, and results that neither exist nor do
not exist at the time of their cause do not arise ultimately.
The implication is proven in the same way as above.

Here is the reasoning known as "The Denial that Things could Arise through
Any of the Four Possibilities," which we use for denying that things can come
from both causes and results:
Consider the functional things of causes and results.
They do not arise ultimately,
For multiple results of multiple causes do not arise ultimately, and
single results of multiple causes do not arise ultimately, and multiple
results of single causes do not arise ultimately, and single results of
single causes do not arise ultimately.

[From the Overview:] Here we will explain the fifth type of reasoning, the one
based on interdependence, and known as the "King of Reasons." First we will
present the reasoning, and then secondly prove the validity of its elements.
Consider all inner and outer things that perform a function.
They are not real,
For they are interdependent.
The reasoning can also be stated as:
Consider all inner and outer things that perform a function.
They do not arise really,
For they arise in dependence on other things which act as their causes
and conditions.
Either way you state the reasoning, the following part should be added at the
end:
They are, for example, like the reflection of a figure in a mirror.

Who is Maitreya

Here is how these others make their argument. They say that "It is incorrect
to relate the opening lines [of the Jewel of Realizations], the ones that are an
offering of praise, to any need of the author himself. This is because Maitreya
possesses no state of mind where he is aspiring to fulfill his own needs, and

because the lines appear here only as a means to induce persons other than the
author to follow the work. . ."

Here secondly is our own position. It is incorrect to make the argument that
appeared earlier, for such an argument only reveals that the person making it
has failed to undertake exhaustive study and contemplation of the major
scriptures of the greater way. How can we say this? Let us first ask the
following: do you make this argument assuming that the Holy One [Maitreya]
is a Buddha, or do you make it assuming that he is a bodhisattva?

DANG PO LTAR NA MI RIGS TE, DE LTAR 'DOD PA DE THUN MONG BA PHAR PHYIN THEG PA'I SKABS DANG , THUN MONG MA YIN PA SNGAGS KYI THEG PA'I SKABS MA PHYED PA YIN PA'I PHYIR TE, THUN MONG MA YIN PA SNGAGS KYI LUGS LA RJE BTZUN SANGS RGYAS YIN KYANG , 'DIR THUN MONG BA PHA ROL TU PHYIN PA'I SKABS YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Suppose you say that you are making the former assumption. Doing so
represents a failure to distinguish between speaking in the context of the way
which is shared, the way of the perfections, and speaking in the context of the
way which is not shared; that is, the way of the secret word.

SNGAGS KYI LUGS LA RJE BTZUN SANGS RGYAS YIN TE, DE'I LUGS LA 'JAM DBYANGS SANGS RGYAS GANG ZHIG, RGYU MTSAN RNAM PA KUN TU MTSUNGS PA'I PHYIR,
The teaching of the secret way says that the holy Maitreya is a Buddha. This
is true because--according to the secret way--Manjushri is a Buddha, and the
reasons for His being so apply equally to Maitreya in every respect.

35
Why Tantra Exists

PHA ROL TU PHYIN PA'I THEG PA LA THUN MONG BA DANG , SNGAGS KYI THEG PA LA THUN MONG MA YIN PA'I RNAM GZHAG 'THAD DE, BYANG CHUB LAM RIM DU, THUN MONG BA PHAR PHYIN THEG PA LA SLOB TSUL DANG , THUN MONG MIN PA SNGAGS KYI THEG PA LA SLOB TSUL GNYIS, ZHES GSUNGS PA'I PHYIR DANG , BSDUS DON LAS KYANG , DE LTAR RGYU DANG 'BRAS BU'I THEG CHEN GYI, , LAM MCHOG GNYIS KAR DGOS PA'I THUN MONG LAM, , ZHES SOGS DU MA GSUNGS PA'I PHYIR, GDUL BYA THUN MONG BA DANG THUN MONG MA YIN PA'I LUGS GSUNG PA DANG 'DIR DON GCIG PAR MNGON NO,
It is correct for us to say that the way of the perfections is the way which is
"shared," and that the way of the secret word is the way which is "not shared."
This is because such a description is found in a great number of authoritative
works. The Steps of the Path to Buddhahood, for example, speaks about "how
to train oneself in the way which is shared--the way of the perfections, and
how to train oneself in the way which is not shared--the way of the secret
word." The Concise Steps as well includes the lines:
Thus is the path which is shared,
The one which is required
At both the stage of the cause
As well as the stage of result
In the higher way,
The path which is supreme.
There is another description that mentions the "way for common disciples" and
the "way for unique disciples." It is apparent that these expressions, [which
use the same Tibetan term,] have the same connotation as "shared" and "not
shared" above.

Someone might assert that "In the context of the way of the perfections, the
way of the secret word is not accepted." This though is incorrect, for the Brief
Commentary includes a section where it states that presenting the bodies of a
Buddha as being exactly four is moreover not inconsistent with the way of the
secret word. This section reads: "Nor moreover is this inconsistent with the
other division of the teachings."

GZHAN YANG SNGAGS KYI THEG PA YOD PAR THAL, SNGAGS KYI RGYUD YOD PA'I PHYIR TE, NAM MKHA' LDING GI RGYUD KYI LAS TSOGS LAS NAM MKHAR 'GRO BA SOGS 'BYUNG BA RGYUD GSUNG BA PO'I MTHU LAS BYUNG BAR GSUNGS PA'I PHYIR, RNAM 'GREL LAS, GANG YANG RGYUD RIG 'GA' ZHIG GIS, , LA LA GSANG SNGAGS BYED 'GYUR BA, , DE DAG GIS TE GTZO BO'I MTHU, , DES BSHAD RIGS PA 'JUG PHYIR RO, , ZHES GSUNGS PA'I PHYIR, DE TZAM MA GTOGS DE DAG GIS GANG BSHAD THAMS CAD RANG NI KHAS BLANGS MI NUS SO,
There are other reasons too which prove that there is a way of the secret word.
It is stated with authority that the ability to fly in the sky, and other such
miraculous abilities described in the Tantra of the Garuda, occur through the
power of the being who has spoken the tantra. This is true because the
Commentary on Valid Perception states:
There do exist the ones who know
The tantra and can in cases
Use the secret word with success;
These are the proof. It's mainly the power
Of the one who taught it,
And following his precepts.
Beyond this type of reasoning, I personally am unable to accept all the other
things that people say on this point.

The above arguments demonstrate then that the Maitreya who authored the
Ornament is a bodhisattva who has one life to go. This is true since the Mother
includes a line which says, "Go and ask Maitreya there; he is a bodhisattva
who has one life to go." Moreover, the Higher Line states that Maitreya
authored it in order to utilize the word of the Able One to purify himself of the
obstacles to omniscience.

The Asian Classics Institute
Course XVI: The Great Ideas of Buddhism, Part One
Reading Five: Applied Meditation, Part One
The following selections are taken from the Great Book on the Steps of the Path
(Lam-rim chen-mo) written by Je Tsongkapa (1357-1419). This part of his work is
a commentary on a well-known prayer called the King of All Prayers, the Prayer of
the Realized One, Deeds of All Goodness. Also included is a special prayer to Je
Tsongkapa entitled A Thousand Angels of the Heaven of Bliss.

The Six Preliminaries to Meditation

Here we begin a brief presentation of how to practice the steps of the path to
Buddhahood. First we will make the actual presentation, and after that refute
certain mistaken ideas about the steps. The presentation itself comes in two
sections; the first is how to proceed during meditation periods. This starts
with Six Preliminaries to meditation.

2
Making a Sacred Space

1A/GSER GLING PA'I RNAM THAR YIN PAS, GNAS KHANG LEGS PAR BYI DOR BYAS LA SKU GSUNG THUGS KYI RTEN LEGS PAR DGRAM,
[1] Here we are following the descriptions of how Serlingpa practiced during
his life. The first preliminary to meditation is to make the room tidy and clean;
then set up a beautiful altar, with representations of the Buddha's body,
speech, and mind.
3
Setting Forth Offerings

2A/MCHOD PA G-YO MED PAR BTZAL LA BKOD PA MDZES PAR BSHAM,
[2] The second preliminary is to go and find offerings that you obtain without
using any dishonest means. Put them forth in an attractive arrangement.
4

[3] Now the Levels of Listeners [by Master Asanga] says that, when you are
practicing to purify the mind of the obstacles of sleepiness and fogginess, you
should "press them upon each other." It also states that, when you are

practicing to purify the mind of other kinds of obstacles, such as attraction to
the objects of the senses, you should seat yourself upon a platform or smaller
seat and assume the full lotus position. Therefore the third preliminary is to
seat yourself on a comfortable cushion, sit up straight, and assume a full lotus
position with your legs (a half lotus is also acceptable). In this pose then sink
your mind deep into the thoughts of taking refuge, and the wish for
enlightenment.
5
Visualizing the Garden

[4] The fourth preliminary is to visualize the garden for gathering the power
of good. In the space before you, imagine the Lamas of both the far-reaching
lineage, and the lineage of the profound view. Together with them are an
inconceivable mass of Buddhas, and bodhisattvas, listeners, self-made Buddhas,
and protectors of the Dharma.

[5] It is extremely difficult to bring the path to grow within the stream of your
mind if all you practice is the various principal causes. You also need the
supporting causes for the path to grow; you need to gather together the

different factors that are conducive to the path, and you need to clean yourself
of the factors that are obstacles, the ones that oppose the path. Therefore you
must train your mind in the Seven Ingredients, which include in them all the
critical points for gathering good and cleaning away obstacles.

[a] The first ingredient is prostration. There is one kind of prostration that
combines all three doors of expression. It is found in the verse [from the King
of All Prayers, the Prayer of the Realized One, Deeds of All Goodness] that includes
the words "Whosoever they are, as many as there may be." [The full verse
reads:

I bow down, and purely,

Whosoever they are,
As many as there may be,
To those Who are Gone;
Gone in the past,

Here we are not talking of a Buddha on a certain planet in a certain direction
of space, nor are we talking of a Buddha of a particular time; our prostrations
rather are directed at each and every Victorious Buddha, those who live in
every one of the ten directions of space itself--those who have already come
before, those who are going to come in the future, and those who now are
here. Don't do your prostrations just to go along with the crowd; do them
rather out of deep respect, from the depths of your heart.
On this the master Yeshe De, in his commentary, notes that "The good deed
you do by prostrating to a single Buddha is beyond any means of measuring.
So there's no need to mention what a goodness it is to picture this many
Buddhas, and then prostrate yourself to them."

[b] This brings us to the second ingredient: offering. The offering which does
have something higher is found in the two verses that contain the words "holy
flowers". [The full verses read:

,NA BZA' DAM PA RNAMS DANG DRI MCHOG DANG ,
,PHYE MA PHUR MA RI RAB MNYAM PA DANG ,
,BKOD PA KHYAD PAR 'PHAGS PA'I MCHOG KUN GYIS,
,RGYAL BA DE DAG LA NI MCHOD PAR BGYI,
I make offerings
To all of these
Victorious Ones;
Holy Flowers, holy garlands,
Cymbals and ointments,
The highest parasol,
The highest lamp,
And holy incenses.
I make offerings
To all of these
Victorious Ones;
Holy silken clothing,
The highest scent,
And a mountain of incense powder
High as Meru--
All set forth
In a way more lovely
Than any other thing there is.]

The words "holy flower" refer to the most wondrous blooms of all in the lands
of both pleasure beings and humans; here they are single flowers. "Garlands"
are assortments of flowers pressed together on a string. Either way, the
flowers can be real ones, or made of other things.
The word "cymbals" refers to all types of music, whether it's on a stringed
instrument, a wind instrument, or percussion like drums or cymbals.
"Ointments" are thick potions with a delicious smell of incense. The "highest
parasol" is the finest of all umbrella-like coverings. The "highest lamp" is one
that burns from a fragrant mixture like incense and butter; it shines bright, and
gives forth a light as lovely as the flask of a precious gem. The incense
mentioned can be either the kind that is a concoction of various sweet-smelling
substances, or just one of these substances by itself.
"Holy silken clothing" refers to the finest of all the clothing there is. "Highest
scent" means perfumed liquid presented in the form of a water offering; it is
made of water, or something similar, imbues with a delicious scent so powerful
that it can spread throughout the entire system of a thousand thousand
planets. "Incense powder" refers to incense in the form of powder, which you
either spread itself or sprinkle atop a fire to make a fragrant smoke. It is in
packets, or else laid out in lines like the colored sand used to draw a mandala,
in a huge mass as high and wide as Meru, the great mountain in the center of
the world.
The phrase "set forth" applies to each of the substances that are being offered;
the original Sanskrit word here can mean "majority," or "put forth," or
"various."

,BKOD PA NI GONG MA KUN GYI MTHAR SBYOR BA STE PHAL CHE BA DANG SPRAS PA DANG SNA TSOGS PA LA BYA'O, , MCHOD PA BLA NA MED PA NI, MCHOD PA GANG RNAMS ZHES PA'I TSIGS BCAD GCIG STE, BLA NA YOD PA NI 'JIG RTEN PA'I MCHOD PA YIN PAS, 'DIR NI BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA' LA SOGS PA MTHU CAN RNAMS KYIS BZANG DGU SPRUL BA'O, , TSIG RKANG PA THA MA GNYIS NI GONG MA DE GNYIS MA TSANG BA THAMS CAD LA SBYAR TE PHYAG DANG MCHOD PA RNAMS KYI KUN SLONG DANG YUL STON PA'O,
The other kind of offering is the one which does not have anything higher.
This one is found in the single verse which includes the words "Any and every
offering." [The full verse reads:

,MCHOD PA GANG RNAMS BLA MED RGYA CHE BA,
,DE DAG RGYAL BA THAMS CAD LA YANG MOS,
,BZANG PO SPYOD LA DAD PA'I STOBS DAG GIS,
,RGYAL BA KUN LA PHYAG 'TSAL MCHOD PAR BGYI,
I see as well
Any and every offering
Unsurpassed, reaching far and wide,
Handed up to every Victor;
By all the power of my faith
In the Deeds of Goodness may I truly
Bow down and make offerings
Onto all the Victors.]
Offerings which we say "have something higher" are those of worldly beings.
Therefore the offerings made in this verse consist of all the many wondrous
things that very powerful beings, such as bodhisattvas, are capable of
emanating with their mind.
The words of the second half of this verse should be applied anywhere in the
verses before where the intent is not stated directly. Their function is to
express both the motivation with which the prostration and offering are made,
as well as the object towards which they are directed.

[c] The third ingredient is confession, and is found in the single verse with the
words "like and dislike". [The full verse reads:

,'DOD CHAGS ZHE SDANG GTI MUG DBANG GIS NI,
,LUS DANG NGAG DANG DE BZHIN YID KYIS KYANG ,
,SDIG PA BDAG GIS BGYIS PA CI MCHIS PA,
,DE DAG THAMS CAD BDAG GIS SO SOR BSHAGS,
I confess, one by one,
Each and every one
Of all the wrong deeds
I may have committed
In action or word,
And also thought,
Motivated by like or dislike,
Or by dark ignorance.]
This refers to what was done with one of the three mental poisons as its cause;
and with my body or of the rest as the vehicle; and with a nature of having
been committed, either directly by myself, or by someone else at my bidding,
or by someone else with my gladness that it was done. The words "all the
wrong deeds I may have committed" are meant to include all these elements.
Try to bring to mind all the problems that these deeds will bring you, and so
feel regret for whatever you have done in the past, and a sense to restrain
yourself in the future. Then make your confession. Doing this prevents any
future wrong from starting at all.

[d] The fourth ingredient is rejoicing, and is found in the one verse with the
words "Victors in any of the ten directions." [The full verse reads:

,PHYOGS BCU'I RGYAL BA KUN DANG SANGS RGYAS SRAS,
,RANG RGYAL RNAMS DANG SLOB DANG MI SLOB DANG ,
,'GRO BA KUN GYI BSOD NAMS GANG LA YANG ,

Over every single one
Of the good deeds ever done
By beings in any of the ten directions:
By all of the Victors,
By all of their Sons and Daughters,
By those Self-Made,
By those on the paths of learning,
By those on the paths done learning,
By anyone at all.]
Try to think about the great goodness that comes from the virtuous deeds of
these five different kinds of holy beings, and dwell in a sense of gladness, like
a beggar who has stumbled across a mine of gold.

[e] The fifth ingredient is urging holy ones to turn the Wheel of the Dharma.
This is found in the one verse with the words "Who in all the ten directions."
[The full verse reads:

This verse is addressed to those who in paradises in all the ten directions of
space have but only recently found Buddhahood in the Buddha's perfect
enlightenment--who have reached the state beyond desire, a knowledge which

goes anywhere it wants, unstoppable. We are urging them to send forth an
equal number of bodies, to come and teach the Dharma.
The commentary by Yeshe De gives the root text here as "found Buddhahood
in the Buddha's perfect enlightenment" [rather than "taken each of the steps to
Buddhahood," and I have followed him.]

[f] The sixth ingredient is supplication, and is found in the one verse which
contains the words "pretend to pass into nirvana." [The full verse reads:

,MYA NGAN 'DA' STON GANG BZHED DE DAG LA,
,'GRO BA KUN LA PHAN ZHING BDE BA'I PHYIR,

And make this supplication
To all of those who may intend
To pretend to pass into nirvana:
Stay, I pray to help all beings
And bring them to happiness;
Stay for eons equal in number
To the atoms of every world.]

Here we are making supplication to all those in worlds of the ten directions of
space who might pretend to pass into nirvana. We are requesting them to
stay, ultimately to bring all beings help, and in the interim to give them
happiness. We ask them to stay, and not to pass on, for eons equal in their
number to all the atoms that make up the various worlds of the universe. We
make our supplication, praying that they will remain, in bodies beyond all
counting.

Dedicating

words "prostrations and..." [The full verse reads:

,RJES SU YI RANG BSKUL ZHING GSOL BA YI,
,DGE BA CUNG ZAD BDAG GIS CI BSAGS PA,

I dedicate
To my future enlightenment
All my merit,
Whatever little goodness
I may have gathered here
By bowing myself and offering,
By confessing and rejoicing,
By urging and supplication.]
Here we are taking all the virtuous seeds within us, represented by the
goodness we have accomplished in practicing the six ingredients that have
already come, and dedicating them as a cause for the full enlightenment of
ourselves and every living being, together. Make this dedication with
tremendous will, and the power of your good will flow forever, and never
finish.
Read this prayer as I have taught you to here; understand what each verse
means, and say it out slowly, without letting your mind wander to something
else. If you can do this, then you will gain a great mountain of good deeds,
beyond any kind of measuring.
Five of the ingredients we have listed here--prostrating, offering, urging,
supplicating, and rejoicing--help you to gather together the different factors
that are conducive to the path. One of them, confessing, helps you clean
yourself of the factors that are obstacles, ones that oppose the path. One part
of rejoicing--dwelling in a sense of gladness over the good you have done
yourself--also functions to multiply your virtue.
Dedication works to multiply, fantastically, even the minor good deeds you
have done in the acts of gathering, and cleaning, and multiplying. It also takes
good deeds that are short-term, those that are going to give a good result and
then disappear, and changes them so that they will never be exhausted. In
brief, it functions in all three ways: to gather, to clean, and to multiply such
that goodness never ends.

For the sixth and final preliminary, refresh your visualization, and make an
offering of a mandala. Them make a request that the Lamas bless the stream
of your mind. Ask Them to help you stop, quickly, everything from
disrespecting your Spiritual Guide on up to grasping to some ingrained self-
nature, in either of its two forms. Ask Them to help you develop, smoothly,
every single kind of thought which is perfect and unmistaken; everything from
respect for your Spiritual Guide, on up to the realization of suchness, the fact
that nothing has any nature of its own. And ask them finally to help you put
a final end to all the things, within you or outside of you, that might obstruct
your spiritual progress.
Make this supplication over and over, many times, with fierce hopes for its
success.

The Conditions for Developing Quietude

*, , LAM RIM CHEN MO LAS,
From the Great Book on the Steps of the Path:

,SO SO'I BSLAB TSUL LA GSUM, ZHI GNAS LA BSLAB TSUL, LHAG MTHONG LA BSLAB TSUL, DE GNYIS ZUNG DU 'BREL BA'I TSUL LO, , DANG PO LA GSUM, ZHI GNAS KYI TSOGS BSTEN PA, DE LA BRTEN NAS ZHI GNAS BSGOM PA'I TSUL, BSGOMS PAS ZHI GNAS GRUB PA'I TSAD DO, , DANG PO NI RNAL 'BYOR PAS THOG MAR BDE ZHING MYUR DU ZHI GNAS 'GRUB PAR 'GYUR BA'I RGYU ZHI GNAS KYI TSOGS LA BRTEN PAR BYA'O, , 'DI LA DRUG LAS,
The explanation of how to train yourself in each of the two [quietude and
special sight] has three parts: how to train yourself in quietude, how to train
yourself in special sight, and how the two are joined in union. The first of
these parts itself has three sections: how to gather together the conditions for
quietude, how to meditate on quietude after you have gathered together these
conditions, and how to know when your meditation has actually brought you
to quietude. The first is described in the words, "Holy practitioners should
first gather together the conditions for quietude: the causes that will allow
them to develop quietude quickly and easily." Here there are six different
conditions.

[1] The first condition is to do your meditation staying in a place which is
conducive for it. The place should have five different qualities:
a) It should be a place with things that are "easy to find," in the sense
that you can find food, clothing, and other necessities without any
trouble.
b) It should be a "good place," in the sense that there are no fearful
creatures like wild animals or the like, nor any persons like enemies
who would try to harm you.
c) It should have a "good environment," in the sense that the
environment doesn't cause any kinds of sickness to develop in you.
d) There should be "good friends" there, in the sense that your
companions in the place share your sense of morality, and your world
view.
e) The place should "have goodness," in the sense that, during the day,
there should not be many people around and, during the night, there
should not be many sounds.
As the Jewel of the Sutras says,
The place where intelligent people practice
Should have things that are good to find,
It should be a good place, with a good environment,
A place where good friends stay,
With all the practitioner needs, with ease.

18
Live Simply

attachment to things like fine robes, or a lot of things, or the like.
19

[4] The fourth condition is that you give up trying to do too many things. You
give up undesirable actions like business; you avoid being too familiar with
laymen or monks; you stop practicing the minor arts of medicine, astrology,
or the like.

21

[5] The fifth condition is that your morality is perfectly pure. With regard to
your vows of individual freedom, and your bodhisattva vows, you never break
down the foundation of your training, the things you have been taught that are
naturally wrong to do, and those that the Buddha has prohibited. If out of a
lack of attention you do commit such deeds, your are quick to regret them, and
you try to make up in the proper way.

[6] The sixth condition is that you totally rid yourself of the stupid thoughts
of desire and the rest. You meditate on the problems of desire in this
life--how it can bring you to death, and to bondage; and you meditate on the
problems it brings you in the life after--a birth in the realms of misery, or the
like. Or else you can meditate on how each and every one of these pretty
things in the suffering cycle of life is going to end; how quickly it disappears;

how surely it will be torn from me before very long. Try then to get
accustomed to thoughts like this: So why do I find myself caring at all about
these things? What use are they for me? Use these to rid yourself of every
stupid thought of desire.

The Nine States of Meditation

Here is the third division, which is a description of how one achieves the nine
states of meditation using the steps explained above. Anyone who hopes to
practice meditation must become proficient in these nine states; and to become
proficient in them, one must know what they are. So here is an explanation
of the nine states, which are called (1) placing the mind on the object; (2)
placing the mind on the object with some continuity; (3) placing the mind on
the object and patching the gaps; (4) placing the mind on the object closely; (5)
controlling the mind; (6) pacifying the mind; (7) pacifying the mind totally; (8)
making the mind single-pointed; and (9) achieving equilibrium.
24
Placing the Mind on the Object

Here is the first state of meditation, called "placing the mind on the object."
You achieve this state by means of receiving instructions from your lama about
the object you should use for your meditation. The mind at this point stays on
the object only from time to time, and for the most part is not fixed on the
object at all: you are unable to keep your mind on the object for any
continuous length of time. The two mental functions of noting and examining
are present, and due to this you often lose yourself to scattering and agitation.
You become aware of this condition and so you get the impression that you
have even a greater problem of too many thoughts coming up to your mind
than you ever had before. What's really happening though is not that you
have more of these thoughts than before; it's just that you have now become
aware of the problem.
25
Gaining Continuity

GNYIS PA NI DE LTAR BSGOMS PAS SEMS DMIGS PA LA BZHAG TZAM GYIS RGYUN CUNG ZAD MTHUD THUB PA NI DPER NA MA nI PHRENG SKOR GCIG TZAM GYI RING BSGOM NA DE'I RING MI GA YENG BA 'BYUNG BA LTA BU YIN, 'DI'I TSE SKABS RE RNAM RTOG ZHI ZHING SKABS RE RNAM RTOG SKYE BAS RNAM RTOG NGAL BSO BA'I NYAMS 'ONG , 'DI BSAM PA'I STOBS KYIS 'GRUB,
Here is the second state of meditation, called "placing the mind on the object
with some continuity." This state is reached when you practice placing the
mind on the object enough that you can now keep your mind on it for some
continuous, although brief, period of time. You could say it would be like
being able to keep your mind from wandering for as long as it would take to
do one round of the mani mantra on your rosary. At this point your problem
of having too many thoughts goes away for a while, and then comes back for
a while, so the impression you have is that these thoughts are making a
periodic resurgence. This particular state of meditation is achieved through
contemplating.

SEMS GNAS DANG PO DANG GNYIS PA 'DI GNYIS LA BYING RGOD MANG ZHING GNAS PA NYUNG BAS YID BYED BZHI'I DANG PO BSGRIMS TE 'JUG PA'I SKABS YIN ZHING GNAS PA LAS GA YENG BA RGYUN RING BA YIN GSUNGS,
During these first two states of meditation, you have an abundance of dullness
and agitation, and only occasionally fix your mind on the object. Therefore at
this point we say that your mind is in the first of the four mental modes, the
one described as having to "concentrate to focus." During these stages, said
our Lama, the periods of distraction last longer than the periods in which the
mind is fixed on the object.
26
Patching the Gaps

GSUM PA NI, GOS LTA BU'I GZHI LA LHAN PA BRGYAG PA BZHIN, RGYUN MTHUD PA'I GZHI DE'I STENG NAS SEMS DMIGS PA LAS GA YENGS PA 'PHRAL DU SHES NAS SLAR DMIGS RTEN LA GLAN TE 'JOG PA LA ZER BAS 'DI DANG SNGA MA GNYIS LA GA YENG BA YUN RING THUNG YOD, 'DI'ANG DRAN PA STOBS LDAN BSKYED PA'I DUS YIN GSUNGS,
Here is the third state of meditation, called "placing the mind on the object and
patching the gaps." The place where you put a normal patch is a piece of
cloth; here the place you put the patch is the continuation of your focus. What
this means is that you catch your mind quickly after it wanders away from the
object, and so "patch" the hole in the continuation. The difference between this
state of meditation and the two that come before it is in the length of time you
are distracted. Our Lama also noted that this is the time when you are able to
develop your recollection to a high degree.

27
Placing the Mind Closely on the Object

Here is the fourth state of meditation, called "placing the mind on the object
closely." Since by now your recollection is highly developed, you are able to
place your mind on the object of meditation in such a way that it is no longer
possible to lose it completely; this then is what differentiates this state from the
three before it. Even though you are succeeding in keeping the object from
being lost, nonetheless dullness and agitation are present in your mind, and
they are very strong. Therefore you must at this point apply the correction for
dullness and agitation. These two levels, the third and fourth, are achieved by
means of recollection. Our Lama noted that from this point on the power of
our meditation was complete, or full-grown, like a person who has reached
maturity.
28
Controlling the Mind

LNGA PA NI, BZHI PA'I SKABS SU SEMS NANG DU BSDUS DRAGS PAS 'DIR BYING BA PHRA MO'I NYEN CHE BAS SHES BZHIN STOBS LDAN BSKYED NAS, DES BYA RA BYAS TE TING NGE 'DZIN GYI YON TAN BSAMS NAS SEMS GZENGS BSTOD, 'DI DANG SNGA MA GNYIS LA BYING RGOD RAGS PA 'BYUNG MI 'BYUNG GI KHYAD YOD,
Here is the fifth state of meditation, called "controlling the mind." There is a
tendency during the fourth state to draw your mind too far inside, and there
is a great danger that this can lead to subtle dullness. Therefore we must now

develop our watchfulness to a high degree. It goes and spies on the mind, and
finds something wrong; in response then we must uplift the mind by thinking
over the many benefits that single-mindedness can bring to us. The difference
between this state and those before it is whether or not obvious dullness can
occur.
29
Pacifying the Mind

Here is the sixth state of meditation, called "pacifying the mind." The great
danger at this point is that subtle agitation occurs, as a result of uplifting the
mind too far while in the fifth state. Whenever this subtle agitation comes, you
must raise up a powerful kind of watchfulness to detect it; realize that even
very subtle agitation is a serious fault in your meditation, and stop it. What
distinguishes this stage from the one before it is whether or not there is a great
danger of having subtle dullness. These last two states, the fifth and the sixth,
are achieved by means of watchfulness. From this point on, said our Lama,
the power of our watchfulness is complete.
30
Pacifying the Mind Totally

By the time you reach the seventh state of meditation, which we call "pacifying
the mind totally," your recollection and watchfulness are total, and so it is
unlikely that dullness and agitation are going to occur. At this point you must
bring your effort up to a powerful level; see how destructive even subtle forms
of dullness and agitation are, and do whatever you can to eliminate them
altogether. The difference between this state and the ones before it is whether
or not you should worry much about slipping into subtle dullness or agitation.
Although there is no great danger at this point that subtle dullness and
agitation will occur, you must still make great effort to implement the various
methods for eliminating them. While you are in the fifth and sixth states of
meditation, you still have to be concerned whether or not dullness and
agitation are going to attack you. Here in the seventh state though you have
the ability to initiate the effort necessary to block them; and so, said our Lama,
dullness and agitation are unable to attack and create an obstacle. During
these last five states of meditation--that is, from the third through to the
seventh--the mind is for the most part in single-pointed meditation.
Nonetheless, conditions such as dullness and agitation are interrupting ones
concentration, and so we describe the mental mode during these periods as
"engaging but interrupted."

Here is what happens when you reach the eighth state of meditation, called
"making the mind single-pointed." When you begin a meditation session, you
must still make a slight effort to bring up the various corrections. After that
though you are able to go for an entire session without even the subtle forms
of dullness and agitation coming up in the mind. These last few stages are like
having an enemy who is at full strength, one who has lost part of his strength,
and one whose strength is completely lost. Since these examples describe how
dullness and agitation gradually lose their power, we can say that from the
eight state of meditation you no longer need to make any conscious effort to
apply watchfulness. Because in this eighth state you can make a little effort at
the opening of a meditation session and then pass the entire period without
being interrupted by problems such as dullness and agitation, the mental mode
at this point is described as "engaging without interruption." The seventh and
eighth states of meditation are achieved through applying effort.

Here is the ninth state of meditation, called "achieving equilibrium." Here your
mind is engaging in the object without any conscious effort at all. This state
comes about as a result of having repeated the eighth state over and over until
you are completely accustomed to it, and then you can go into meditation
spontaneously, effortlessly. This is similar to the point you reach in your
recitations when you can read out a text from memory without any effort,
since you have practiced reciting it repeatedly. You go into single-minded
meditation in a single swoop. This state of mind is for all intents and purposes
a desire-realm form of single-pointed quietude. The ninth state is achieved
through being totally accustomed.

The Motivation for Meditation
The following selections are taken from Preparing for Tantra: The Mountain of
Blessings. The root text of this book was written by Je Tsongkapa Lobsang Drakpa
(1357-1419), and the commentary by Pabonka Rinpoche (1878-1941). The book was
translated by Khen Rinpoche Geshe Lobsang Tharchin (1921-) and Geshe Michael
Roach (1952-). Khen Rinpoche also wrote the following introductory sections.
Before you start this little book, decide on your motivation for reading it.
Think to yourself,
I want to reach enlightenment as soon as possible. I want to
reach it in this very life. And when I do, I will free every living
being from every pain of the suffering existence we all live now.
Then I will take all these beings up to the level of a Buddha,
which is the ultimate state of happiness. This is why I am going
to read this book, which shows all the steps to enlightenment.
Take a moment now before you go on. Make sure you have this motivation.
This little book covers absolutely everything that the Buddha ever taught. In
Tibet we have a hundred great volumes of the Buddhas' own teachings,
translated into Tibetan from Sanskrit, the language of ancient India. And this
small book covers all of them.
All the old, great books of Buddhism have but one main goal, and that is to
show how any one of us can reach the state of perfect enlightenment. They tell
us everything we have to do: how to reach the goal, how to practice, and how
to learn. They show us how to begin, they show us how to finish. Everything
we need is in those books.

Five hundred years ago in Tibet there came a master monk and teacher, whose
name was Tsongkapa the Great. He took these ancient volumes and arranged
them into a kind of book known as the Lam Rim, which means "Steps of the
Path to Enlightenment." Here he laid out all the steps that any of us can go
through, one by one in the proper order, if we truly wish to reach
enlightenment. He took care to present the steps clearly and simply, yet
covering everything that must be done, as we start on the path, and travel
along it, and finally reach its end.
The small book here is called the Source of All My Good. It is the absolute
essence of all the Lam Rims, of all the books on the Steps to enlightenment.
The text was written by Tsongkapa himself, and it is named from the opening
lines, which read: "The source of all my good is my kind Lama, my Lord."
In the teachings on the Steps this work is also known by another name,
something of a secret name, which is Begging for a Mountain of Blessings. The
word "blessing" here refers to the blessings of all the Buddhas of the universe.
"Mountain" comes from a Tibetan word which means a huge pile, a great mass
of things all heaped together in one place. The word "begging" is meant to
show how much we need and want these blessings.
When we recite this work out loud, then, it's as though we are begging the
Buddhas to grant us their blessings, to help us achieve everything from the
beginning up to final enlightenment. We are asking them to help us reach all
the various paths, all the different levels of knowledge; we are asking for the
power of their blessings, we are begging them for help.
Just whom are we asking for help? Normally when we perform the secret
Ceremony of the Tenth, we begin with the Practice of Six, followed by the
Thousand Angels. Just after that we start this Source of All My Good. Therefore
we still have in front of us the same holy beings who were there during the
Thousand Angels.
Sitting in the center, in mid-air before us, is Tsongkapa. Inside his heart is
Gentle Voice, or Manjushri, who is the image of all the Buddhas' wisdom. In
the heart of Gentle Voice is another holy being, Vajradhara--this is the Keeper
of the Diamond, or the Buddha of the secret teachings. His body is blue, and
within his own heart is the Sanskrit letter huung. This letter is marked with
another letter, mam.
On Tsongkapa's own right is his disciple Gyaltsab Je, whose full name is
Gyaltsab Darma Rinchen. Within this disciple's heart is Loving Eyes, whose
Sanskrit name is Avalokiteshvara, and who is the embodiment of all the
Buddhas' love. Inside the heart of Loving Eyes is again the Keeper of the
Diamond, and in his heart the letter huung, marked with a mam.

On the other side, to Tsongkapa's left, is his disciple Kedrup Je, whose full
name is Kedrup Je Gelek Pelsang. Inside of his heart is the Holder of the
Diamond, or Vajrapani, and in the Holder's heart is the Keeper of the
Diamond. Within the Keeper's heart is a letter huung, marked with a mam.
All of these beings are seated in the air in front of you, and they are the ones
whom you are asking for their blessing. They are the ones that you are
requesting to help you, to grant you every kind of knowledge, from the
beginning of the path on up to final enlightenment.
Now I want you to think about something. What is the difference between a
Buddha and us? What is it that makes all the Buddhas different from us?
And what about you, yourself? You are trying to reach Buddhahood; but what
is the difference between all these Buddhas, and you? This is a question you
must examine, and then the answer will come to you.
What are the Buddhas? First of all the places where they live are paradise.
Pure paradise. The paradises where the Buddhas live are completely pure,
they are pure by their very nature, and there is not a single thing about them
which is not pure.
Inside themselves too the Buddhas are pure. They have no inner obstacles at
all, no bad deeds stored up in them, no problems of any kind. They have none
of the problems that are caused by any of the four elements of the physical
world, either around them or within them. They have no sickness, no getting
old, no death. They do not even have a word for these things where they live.
This is why their paradises have names like the "Heaven of Bliss," for they live
in the highest happiness that there is.
When we think about our own lives then we can see the big difference
between Buddhas and us. In one sense we are very fortunate; we have all had
the very great fortune to be born as a human being, and we can enjoy that
small amount of happiness which human beings sometimes experience. And
so sometimes we think we are happy.
But still we have problems, a lot of problems. We have problems all around
us, and we have problems inside of us. We have problems that come with the
very nature of the kind of life we live. The Buddhas have none of these
problems.
Try to think about this difference between the Buddhas and you. Why did you
get this book, why are you going to read this book? The main purpose is to
reach enlightenment, to gain the highest state of happiness that exists. And to
get there you must escape all the sufferings that come with our present kind
of life.

To do all this you are going to have to follow some kind of practice. You are
going to have to move up through certain levels, certain paths, one by one
through a great many different Steps. You will have to go in order, gradually,
through each of these Steps. Each higher Step you will have to reach by
practicing, and to practice you must learn what to practice. If you never learn
what to do, you will never be able to do it.
In this little book you are going to learn what to do. But this is only a
preparation for something else.
Generally speaking, this book is all you need. If this is all you ever learn, and
if you practice what you learn here, then you will reach enlightenment. But
it will take a long time to do so if you restrict yourself to this way, to the way
of the open teachings of the Buddha. It will take a very, very long time.
But you want enlightenment, you need it, and you need it now. Why?
Because the reason you are reading this book, the whole point of studying
these things and reaching these goals, is to help each and every living being.
All of them have been your own mother, and the purpose of everything is to
help them.
Right now they are suffering, by the very nature of the life we live. Most of
them are living in the three lower kinds of birth. Even those who live in one
of the higher kinds of birth are suffering too; by the very nature of things, they
are in some kind of pain, all the time. Your goal is to save them from this
pain, your goal is to help them reach enlightenment, which is absolute
happiness. This is why you are studying, this is why you are practicing.
If you only use the way of the open teachings, it will take a long time to reach
the goal. But you want the goal now, you want to reach it quickly, because all
these living beings around you, all who have been your mother during some
lifetime in the past, are suffering in this kind of existence. You cannot stand
to have their pain continue, you cannot let them go on suffering so long.
And so you will free them, and you will free them quickly, now. But is there
any way to do it so fast? The answer is yes, there is a way, a path that works
faster than any other, a path which is very deep and powerful and holy. This
is the Tantric path, the secret path of the Diamond Queen: Vajra Yogini.
To practice this path you must receive an initiation to enter it, and then you
must receive her teachings. But before you can do this you must first be
granted another initiation, one which will qualify you to study and follow her
path. There are four great groups of secret teachings, and to qualify to practice
the path of this Angel you must be granted an initiation that belongs to the
group which is called the "unsurpassed." Therefore the most important thing
for you to do first is to seek an initiation of the "unsurpassed" group.

According to the tradition of the Diamond Queen, the best initiation to prepare
yourself for her own initiation and path is the one we call the "Union of the
Spheres." There are though other initiations of the unsurpassed group which
you can seek if you cannot get this one; for example, there is the initiation of
the being known as Frightener, which is much shorter and easier than the one
for the Union of the Spheres, and still qualifies you to take her initiation later.
There is another step you should take too before seeking her initiation. When
you go to a college to get an advanced degree, or any degree at all, you must
first enter the college. Then you go to classes, do your study, and finally after
a number of years you complete all the requirements, and reach your goal. To
reach the goal then it is very important that you study and learn, on a constant
basis. But to study, and learn, you first have to gain entrance into the college.
It's all the same here. The first thing you have to do is to gain entrance into
the unsurpassed group of the secret teachings of the Buddha. To enter these
teachings you have to go through the gate, and this is the initiation. The
initiation is the door.
When you take the initiation, you commit yourself to a number of vows.
Keeping these vows is like doing your study on a daily basis once you've been
allowed to enter the college. In a school you have to learn what to study, and
then you have to maintain a regular schedule of study. Here in the secret
teachings, the vows that you took when you received your initiation are what
you have to study: these are what you have to maintain on a regular, daily
basis.
To keep the vows, you have to learn all about them. This is why it's essential
that after your first initiation you study, in detail, the secret vows, along with
the regular vows of morality, and the bodhisattva vows. The very function of
these vows, the result of these vows, is very simple. If you keep them, they
produce enlightenment in you.
Aside from this main function, keeping the vows has another effect as well.
In the short run--that is, while you are still on the path, from the very
beginning on up to the day you reach the ultimate goal--they help you, they
keep you, they preserve you. They make you sweeter and sweeter, more and
more pure, every single day you keep them. Everything about you gets better
and better: the way you act, the way you think, higher and higher, day by day,
month by month.
The vows then are your dear companion, the vows are your devoted helpmate.
Vows are not some kind of punishment; the Lama doesn't come to the sacred
place of initiation, and say to you, "Well now that you've got the initiation,
here are some vows to keep, as a punishment." You must understand all the
great good which the vows do for you, and you must learn what they are.

Once you have learned the vows, you must keep them as your daily practice.
You should reach a point where, as you look back after some time has passed,
you can see progress, you can say to yourself, "A number of years ago, I used
to act like that; I had a certain kind of attitude, certain ways of behaving, the
limitations of my knowledge were such, and my ability too was only so. Now
they have all changed, for the better. Even in the last two years I have
changed; no, even in the last year I have changed." You should be able to see
for yourself, you should be able to judge, by yourself, whether you are keeping
the vows, and how it changes everything about you.
So we are working mainly towards the day when we can receive initiation into
the practice of the Diamond Queen. This will allow us to receive her
teachings, and then to carry them out. To do this, we will first have to seek
any one of the preliminary initiations into the secret teachings of the
unsurpassed group, the highest group of secret teachings.
A person who seeks to be granted an initiation into this highest group should
himself be highest, in the sense that he is highly qualified to receive the
initiation. Becoming highly qualified is something that you must do in the
proper stages, in certain steps, one by one.
Above I asked you to think about what it was that made Buddhas different
from us. In the beginning though all the beings who are Buddhas now were
just the same as we are at present. They lived the same kind of suffering life
that we pass our days in now, and they did so over millions and millions of
years, over very many lifetimes.
At some point though these beings were able to achieve an excellent life as a
human; the same kind that you have now. Within that human life they were
able to meet with an excellent spiritual teacher as well. He or she gave them
the proper training, and the necessary initiations, and as a result these beings
began to get better and better. Finally they achieved enlightenment: they were
able to stop all the problems within them and outside of them, everything. If
they have been able to practice and achieve this goal, then why can't you?
Why not?
And so it is possible for you to become someone who is highly qualified, who
is qualified to an unsurpassed degree to take one of the initiations of the
unsurpassed group of the secret teachings. To be qualified to take this
initiation, to be a highly qualified practitioner in this sense, means that you
must be a practitioner of what we call the Mahayana: the Greater Way. This is
because all the secret teachings also belong to the greater way; they are in fact
the highest teachings and practices of the greater way. You too then will have
to be an unsurpassed practitioner, of the greater way. But how do you reach
this point?

You must first prepare yourself, with what we call the "shared" practice. The
word "shared" means that this preliminary practice is shared by the way of the
open teachings, and the greater way, and the way of the secret teachings--all
three. It is a practice which all three ways share in common.
Suppose you are planning to construct a very high building, a building with
many stories. The most important thing to do first is to build a good
foundation, a very strong foundation. If the foundation is strong, then you can
build as many stories as you like on top of it.
The little book you have here--Begging for a Mountain of Blessings, complete
with the commentary of the great Pabongka Rinpoche--presents this
foundation. It shows you the practice which is shared by all three ways, and
which will prepare you for initiation into the secret teachings. This is the
strong foundation upon which you will build your great, high house.
Think about it, and be happy. Take some joy now in what you are about to
do. You must realize what a precious opportunity you have in your hands at
this very moment, this one good time. Read, and learn, and try not to forget.
Try to remember what you learn in this little book, and then try to put it into
practice, in your daily life, in a regular way.
By the time you finish this book you should be a different person. The person
who picks this book up to read, and the person who sets it down after
finishing the last page, should be totally different people. On the inside. You
must change: you must change in the way you think, you must change in what
you know, in the way you behave all day, in everything about you. Try to
change yourself. If you do, then you will win the result of reading this book,
of picking it up, and of entering into what it stands for.

Why Study the Steps to Enlightenment?

"And so we begin," said the Lama.
Let me remind you, he said, of those lines by the King of the Dharma of all
three realms--Tsongkapa the Great; the ones that mention "This life of spiritual
leisure, more precious than a jewel that can give you whatever you wish for."
The refrain throughout these verses reads: "Those of you who wish for freedom
should seek to master this, as I have done." You and I have lived in this circle
of suffering life forever; and there is not a single form of life, in any of the six
realms of pain, that we have not already lived.

In these lives we have suffered, and enjoyed the occasional short-lived
pleasure, wandering aimlessly from that high level known as the "Peak of
Existence," then down to the lowest hell, "Torment with No Respite," then back,
and back again. We have lived this way for time with no beginning, and yet
we have never gotten any meaning out of it; the time has slipped away from
us useless, senseless, empty. And so still we are here, circling up and down
in the three realms of the wheel of life, and certain we are to continue the
round.

At some point in days gone by, you and I through sheer good luck were taken
for some brief moments under the care of a Lama, or the Three Jewels, and so
were able to gather together some bit of pure and powerful karma. The force
of this karma, I will admit, has allowed us to gain, just this once, the present
life we enjoy--full of the various leisures and fortunes, free of the problems
that come when we lack the conditions that allow a proper spiritual practice.

I will admit as well that everything we need has come together for us this
time: we have a Lama, we have some Dharma to practice, we have every
favorable condition that we need. And so the capability to follow the spiritual
path is something we now hold in our own two hands. Yet suppose we fail;
suppose that we find ourselves unable to achieve the ultimate goal of the
infinite lives we have led.

Beyond a doubt then we will fall back again to the births where we have no
chance for Dharma. And when we fall it matters not where we fall; wherever
we fall in a birth without the Dharma, our life can never be anything but pain.

The way to avoid ever taking another birth where we have no chance for
Dharma is to practice the Dharma purely now; there is no better way at all.
And our practice must start this minute; you will die, you must die, it is
certain you will die. But you've no idea when. And what will happen after
that?

Whatever we do now decides where we go then: if we do good, it will throw
us forth into one of the better births; if we do wrong, it will throw us to a birth
of misery. So suppose we fail to practice; suppose we die in the middle of our
present evil way of life. It is only fitting then that we should go right where
we belong: to these very births of misery.

We must then for the short term go for shelter to the Three Jewels, to keep
ourselves from a birth in the lower realms. We must as well open up and
admit the things we have done wrong before, and restrain ourselves in the
future. To do so we must make strong and heartfelt use of the four forces that
counteract the power of the wrong. We must too put all our effort into taking
up even the smallest virtue, and giving up even the slightest harms we commit
against others.

If in addition to all this we are able to follow perfectly the path of the three
extraordinary trainings, then we ourselves will come to be free of each and
every fear of the circle of suffering life. But it's not enough if it is only you
who escapes the circle, for we must recall the words of the Master
Chandragomi:

Even a cow knows how
To take care of himself,
To eat a few clumps of grass
He easily comes across;
Even the beast can merrily drink
From a pool of water he finds
As bitter thirst Torments him.
But think now what it is
To put your whole heart
Into taking care of others;
This is glory,
This is a park of pleasure,
This is the ultimate.

The Sun

The Earth

Bears the load,
Holds up all mankind.
And so is the way
Of those great beings
Who wish nothing
For themselves,
Their lives devoted
To a single song:
The well-being and the happiness
Of every living thing.

all other sentient kind. And there is a good reason why we should.

Every single creature in the universe has been our father, and been our mother,

when they served as our parent did not shower us with every deep kindness,
over and over again.

Think: everything we have now, from this precious human body on up, has
come to us through the kindness of other living beings. And so it is now that
we must repay them. The repayment must begin here, in these circumstances,
while I am able, while I possess this perfect form for the practice of the
Dharma.

If now I cannot accomplish this great goal, if all I have gained is wasted, then
there is little point in claiming to work for every living being: it is little likely
that I myself will be able even to reach the higher realms of suffering life
again.

What is the way then to pay this kindness back? No way would be higher
than to see to it that every living creature has every happiness there is, and
that every living creature is free of every pain which exists. And I will do it!
Raise these thoughts of love and compassion up in your heart--bring them on
fiercely.

And then you must resolve to take the load upon yourself: "I will rely on no
one else in this work; it should be I, and I alone who brings every happiness
to every being, and frees each one from every pain."

And yet the ability to perform this noble task is had only by a single being:
only by a Buddha, there's no one else at all who can do it. If for the sole
purpose of all other living creatures I can reach the state of a Buddha, then I
can fulfill completely both of the ultimate goals, and so by the way achieve
everything I ever needed as well.

This is a work of the kind we call the "Steps to Buddhahood"; books like this
contain within themselves each and every crucial point in all the open and
secret teachings of Buddhism. They present these points without the slightest
error, from the very beginning to the very end: from finding and serving a
spiritual guide on up to the perfect secret Union, where there is nothing more
to learn.

are the point of the tip of the highest, matchless peak.

The Steps and the Secret Teachings

Our Lord Lama, in his work entitled Songs of My Spiritual Life, says,
When within yourself you've developed
The path that is shared,
The one that's needed
For both the highest paths...

ZHES PA LTAR SPYIR MDO SNGAGS GANG YIN YANG CHOS BYANG CHUB LAM GYI RIM PA 'DI MED THABS MED LA, LHAG PAR DU RGYAL MCHOG LNGA PA CHEN POS,
What he means is that, speaking in a general way, this instruction on the Steps
to Buddhahood is one that you could never do without, whether you are
practicing the open or the secret teachings of Buddhism. To put it more
specifically, the Great Fifth of the Dalai Lamas has said,

,SKYES PU CHEN PO'I CHOS LUNGS SNYING PO'I DON,

Everybody talks of it,
The Secret Word, The Most Profound,
Essential thread
In the River of Dharma
For those of the great capacity;
But try it before
Your mind is trained
In the path that both them share,
Climb atop a mighty elephant
Still wild, and not yet tamed;
You will only lose
Yourself.

It is absolutely vital then, for anyone with hopes of entering the door that leads
to the way of the Secret Word, that you train your mind first in this path
shared by both the open and secret teachings.

Could any system be more profound or far-reaching than this Dharma, the
Steps of the Path? Certainly not those teachings that others claim are
oh-so-deep, or oh-so-high and inscrutable. People chatter about attaining some
realization, some supposed zenith of some very secret way: they talk of
termination; they talk about the levels of creation and completion; about the
channels and winds and drops; the great seal, or the great completion,
whatever. But if one never makes use of these very Steps, he can never even
plant the seeds, much less bring the path in full to grow within his mind.

The first of these [general sections of the steps of the path] is presented in a
single verse,
the first one of the work:
The source of all my good
Is my kind Lama, my Lord;
Bless me first to see
That taking myself to him
In the proper way
Is the very root
Of the path, and grant me then
To serve and follow him
With all my strength and reverence.

This Step of taking a Lama is itself divided into two sections: developing clear
faith in him, which is the very root of the Path; and then building up reverence
for him, by considering the great kindness he has paid us. The instruction in
developing faith comes in two stages: how to follow a Lama in one's thoughts,
and then how to follow him in one's actions.

Now the Secret Teaching of Sambhuta says,
You will never be able to take a boat
To the other side of the river
Unless you take the oars up in your hands.
You will never reach the end of suffering life
Without a Lama,

The Shorter Sutra on the Perfection of Wisdom concurs:
The Victorious Buddhas,

Of all good qualities,
Speak as one when They say:
"Every single part of the Buddhist way
Depends on a Spiritual Guide."

It says as well:
And so the wise
Who seek the high state of enlightenment
With a fierce wish deep inside
Should smash all pride within them,
And like a mass of sick men
Who flock to medicine for a cure,
Take themselves to a spiritual guide
And serve him single-mindedly.

Our Gentle Savior, Tsongkapa the Great, has too spoken these words:
There is a single key
For finding a perfect start to reach
Your every wish, both happiness
In the short run and ultimately;
And the highest words ever spoken
Speak it always the same:
It is your Lama.
And so you must devote yourself
To meditation upon him,
Upon the essence of all
The three different kinds of refuge;
Ask him, for all your goals.

All these lines are saying the same thing: if you have any hope of reaching up
to the high spiritual qualities of the various levels and paths, then from the
outset you must absolutely find and follow a Lama who can show you how to
do so.

The Qualities of an Authentic Lama

And the Lama that we are describing here is not just any one you might
happen to come across; it's not just anyone they call a "Lama." Rather, he must
have in him the ten high qualities described in the Jewel of the Sutras. He must
first of all be subdued, at peace, and at high peace; that is to say, he must
possess all three of the trainings. He must display fine spiritual qualities that
exceed those of his student, and exhibit exceptional effort. He should have a
total mastery of the Dharma in the form of scripture, and should have realized
suchness. He should be highly skilled in teaching the Dharma, he must have
a great love for his disciples, and he must never become tired or discouraged
in his teaching, no matter how much or how often he is called upon to do so.

We are though now in the days of degeneration, and so perhaps it is difficult
to find someone who possesses each and every one of these qualifications. In
such a case, we must follow the advice of the Lord of Lamas:
If you take my advice,
Man of the land of Gyalkam,
Take yourself to the ultimate
Spiritual guide:
To one who grasps Reality,
To one who has controlled his senses,
Who takes your heart away
As soon as you lay your eyes on him;
To the one that,
When you follow what he teaches,
The good in you begins to flower,
And the bad begins to fade.

,ZHES SOGS LTAR BSLAB PA GSUM GYIS THUGS RGYUD DUL BA, DE NYID RTOGS PA, BRTZE BA DANG LDAN PA STE LNGA TSANG BA DGOS SHING ,
These and other such lines are telling us that the Lama we seek must at least
possess a complete set of five different qualities: He must have brought his
mind under control, by following the three trainings; he must have realized
thusness; and He must have love.

As a bare minimum, the Lama must surely fit the following description. He
must occupy himself more with the Dharma than with the things of the world.
He must as well occupy himself more with the concerns of the future life, than
with those of the present one. He must occupy himself more with helping
others, than with helping himself. He is never careless in what he does, or
says, or thinks. And, finally, he never leads his disciples along a path which
is mistaken.

Suppose you are able to find a Lama like the one we have described above.
What are the benefits you can expect from following him properly? Simply
put, you will win each and every good thing in this and all your future lives.
What are the dangers of refusing to follow him, or of following him less than
properly? You will undergo a great mass of unendurable pain, in both the
short term and the long. You must seek to grasp these facts fully.

Your Lama is like the source, he is like the very root, from which every single
good quality of all the different levels and paths of both the open and secret
teachings spring. If you ever succeed in stopping a single personal fault, it will
be because of him. If you ever manage to cultivate a single spiritual quality,
any good at all, that too will come from him. The whole range of virtues, from
the final attainment of secret Union on down to having a single wholesome
thought, all flow from him.

Your Lama is also the one and only "source" in the sense of being the
embodiment or actuality of all the mighty deeds, all the great good, that all the
victorious Buddhas perform in their holy actions, words, and thoughts. Try
now to develop this root of the path--clear faith in him or her.

GAL CHE,
If with eyes made clear by this faith you begin to see your Lama as a real
Buddha, then the blessing of a real Buddha will follow in your mind-stream.
It's essential therefore that you train your mind in the relevant parts described
in the texts on the Steps: the reasons why you should see that your Lama is a
Buddha; the reasons why you can see that your Lama is a Buddha; how to see
him, and so on.

What does it mean to "follow your Lama properly?" You must understand that
it means to surrender yourself completely to him or her. Here you should take
yourself to him in the way of an obedient child, and with the rest of the nine
attitudes described in the Arrangement of Trunks.

To put it briefly, you must absolutely conduct yourself correctly in this regard;
you must follow precisely every one of the classical descriptions of how to find
and follow a Lama. If the cornerstone of a house--the walls of its
foundation--are solid, then the house itself is solid. If the roots of a tree are
planted firmly in the soil, then the branches and fruit and all the rest grow
strong.

What we hope to grow is the path, in its entirety: all the Steps from
recognizing the importance of the spiritual leisure and fortune of our present
circumstances, on up to the attainment of secret Union itself. We must find
sure and solid knowledge, we must see, that taking ourselves to our Lama
properly will bring all of this about, without any difficulty at all.

The entire subject of how to follow your Lama in your thoughts is revealed in
the words "first to see." Thus you must come to see your spiritual Friend as
a real Buddha; and this brings us to how you should follow him in your
actions.

How can we please our Lama? Relative to the path which is shared, you
should use the instructions found in the discussions on how to find and follow
a Lama in general. Relative to the way of the secret Word, use the instructions
in the Fifty Verses on Lamas. Both of these describe how you should, to the
very best of your ability, "with all your strength," gladly take up any difficult
task in any of the three doors of expression--of body, speech, or mind--in
order to please him or her.

There are different levels of how we pay homage to our Lama: to offer him or
her gifts, material things; to give ourselves up to his service, his honor; and to
take what he has taught us and put it into actual practice, accomplishing our
spiritual goals. Each of these is higher than the one before it, and the last one
is supreme.

And as you serve your Lama, remember. When a farmer goes to plant his
seeds, whatever work he does in the field, he does for his own sake. It's not
as if he is doing the field a favor. Here I am the same. It's me who hopes to

reach freedom from pain, and the state of knowing all things. To do so, I must
take up certain things and give up others; but I am like a man who is blind--I
am totally ignorant of which of these things are which.

And I am not to view this service as if I were laboring for someone else; on the
contrary, I should not even see it as a burden, but rather as a reward: it is my
great good fortune to have the opportunity. And so I must succeed in serving
him or her in both my thoughts and actions, with the deepest feelings of
reverence.

If our service of our Lama is good, then in all our future lives we will find
ourselves taken under the care of Lamas. Then too we can count the life we
have found now as the first in a long and unbroken series of lives in which we
enjoy each of the eight spiritual leisures, and the ten fortunes. And there will
never again be any mistake in this particular arithmetic: we will always enjoy

the exact number of circumstances needed to follow our practice of the
Dharma, and so finally reach the state of perfect enlightenment.

The Precious Life We Have

,MI NYID DBUS SKYES DBANG PO TSANG , , LAS MTHA' MA LOG GNAS LA DAD,
We do have all five of the spiritual fortunes that relate to one's self, as
described in the following verse:
Born as a human,
In a central land,
And having one's faculties
All complete;
Not lost to the last of karma,
And feeling faith for the place.

,CES PA LTAR DGE SLONG PHA MA, DGE BSNYEN PHA MA BCAS STON PA'I 'KHOR RNAM BZHI'AM, GTZO BO DGE SLONG PHA YOD PA'I CHOS TSIGS KYI YUL DBUS SU SKYES SHING , ,
Here "born in a central land" refers to a land where there exists the "core of the
Dharma," meaning that there are people in the country who keep the vows of
the "four attendants to the Buddha." This refers to the full ordinations for a
man and a woman, along with the novice ordinations for the same. The main
component of the core is the fully ordained monk.

LAS MTHA' MA LOG PA STE TSE 'DIR MTSAMS MED KYI LAS BSAGS LA MA SBYANGS PA MIN PA DANG ,
"Not lost to the last of karma" means not having collected, and then failed to
clear from oneself, the karma that comes from committing one of the
"immediate," heinous bad deeds.

The place from where each and every white and good thing grows is the
teaching on discipline; here the word "discipline" can by extension be applied
to the entire contents of the canon--the three collections of scripture--since
they all function to discipline one's mind. We do then possess the fortune of
having faith in the holy books.

,SANG RGYAS BYON DANG DAM CHOS STON, , BSTAN PA GNAS DANG DE RJES 'JUG , GZHAN PHYIR SNYING NI BRTZE BA'O, , ZHES PA'I GZHAN 'BYOR LNGA NAS,
Let us examine though whether we have the five fortunes that relate to what
is outside ourselves. The classic reference here is:
The Buddha is come,
And taught the holy Dharma.
The teaching remains,
As do the ones who follow.
There is compassion
For the sake of others.

Here the Buddha must have come and still be present in the world. He or his
direct disciples must be teaching the Dharma. The resulting teachings must
also remain, and this during the period before his final passing beyond all
sorrow. Certain of his disciples must observe other disciples actually achieve
the four results, after he has taught them; and these disciples must undertake
to follow the same practices too.

All four of the fortunes just explained have been possessed even by the likes
of the monk Udayi, whereas the same cannot be said even for the Savior
Nagarjuna, who lacked them in their literal form. We too have met our Lamas,
who are no different from a Buddha, and they have spoken the Dharma and
so on; these are a full substitute yes, but we cannot say that we have all those
fortunes in their literal form. We do however enjoy all eight of the spiritual
leisures; these then are our primary advantage, and it's with this fact in mind
that the verse reads "life of leisure."

What does it mean when the reference says, "There is compassion for the sake
of others?" The "others" here refers to ourselves; our sponsors and Lamas and
other such persons act for our sake, motivated by compassion, to see that we
are provided with all the conditions that will facilitate our practice of the
Dharma: they give us food, or clothes, and other necessities; They teach us the
Dharma; and so on. Therefore this phrase should be understood as describing
the good fortune to have around us those who give us the things we need to
practice.

People like you and I are forever committing non-virtuous deeds, and this is
the single greatest obstacle to our reaching the state of spiritual leisure and
fortune ever again. Beyond this are statements from the Foundation Word on
Vowed Morality, and other texts, which describe how those born as animals are
fewer than those born in one of the other births of misery; those born as
humans are fewer than the animals; and even among humans those born in a
country where the Buddha's teachings have spread are fewer still.

DE SKYES KYANG CHOS DANG MJAL BA'I RTEN BZANG KHYAD PAR CAN NI RNYED MI SRID PA LTA BU YIN PAS NA, NGO BO'I SGO NAS RNYED DKA',
To be born in such a land, and then go on to actually encounter the Dharma
with a mind and body so very special as the one which we now possess, is an
occurrence which borders on the impossible. This shows how a life like ours
is difficult to find by its very nature as well.

The things I've done, the white or black,
And what these deeds will bring to me,
Follow always close behind,
As certain as my shadow.

But that's not all--there are conditions all around me that can strike and kill
me in an instant: things like illness and harmful spirits, sudden disasters,

The master teacher of Bodong, whose name was Jikdrel Chokle Namgyal, has
also said:
The existence of past and future lives can be understood as well
through logical reasoning. If the human body could occur
without any proper cause, then every existing object might just
as well be stuffed full of human bodies. If the human body
could occur without any involvement of previous consciousness,
if it could come from physical matter alone, then every bit of dirt,
every rock, every mountain and stream might just as well be
stuffed full of human bodies. For those who deny that life goes
on, hearing these lines is like being struck by a bolt of lightning.

Since nothing else can help then, it is essential that we give up on life and be
sure to devote ourselves to death, by practicing some pure form of the
Dharma, as a way to assist our future self. It's not as if, after you and I have
died, the stream of our mind just stops and we turn into nothing. Rather we
have no choice but to take another birth. And there are no more than two
places where we can take that birth: in the higher realms of happiness, or the
lower realms of misery.

DE GNYIS GANG DU SKYE RANG LA RANG DBANG MED PAR 'GRO BA GNYIS KYI RGYU'AM, LAS DKAR NAG GI RJES SU 'GRO DGOS SHING ,
We have absolutely no control over which of the two places we go; we must
follow where we are sent by the separate causes for each place, and these
causes are the things we've done, the white and black, respectively.

Our mental streams contain very, very few of the causes that will take us to a
higher birth; but we have a vast multitude of the causes that will lead us to
one of the births of misery. Right now we are doing both white deeds, and
black deeds: the good and the bad. At the moment of death, the power of one
or the other will be activated, and force us over to our next birth. The seeds
of the deeds which are more plentiful are the kind that are likely to be
activated.

And after we cross over to our new birth, the fair or foul consequences of our
virtue or our evil will follow close behind. These consequences can never go
wrong; good must come from the good, and bad from the bad. They will
attach themselves to my consciousness and pass on to wherever it goes, as
certain as my shadow.

The most important thing is for us to follow the words of that King of the
Dharma, Dromton Je:
We have little time to live,
It's sure we'll not long be here.
Let the world pass the time
Working to feed themselves;
Even the poorest know how.
Those who follow the rules of Dharma
Need not worry,
The knife of hunger
Can never touch and kill them.
Leave this life behind;
You can't work for the future life
And for this one as well.
The next is the more important one;
Make effort in the Dharma.

He says as well,
Whether you fill your belly
In this life well or not,
Still you will live on.

What's difficult is
To meet the Dharma
In your future life;
For this life then
Put all your efforts
Only in the Dharma.
If now you cannot do your best
To do what's virtuous,
Be sure that in the life beyond
You will feel only pain.

That highest of Victors, the Great Fifth of the Dalai Lamas, has said as well,
What happened before?
Someone has been in my mind for time with no beginning.
When was that?
There's never been a moment when they were gone.
Who are they?
I live, and live again, the mental afflictions.
And in the end?
They will leave me to rot in the ocean of suffering
life, without an end in sight.
And the karma?
It comes like the wind, with all the things I never
wanted.
How far?
It whips around me everywhere, and stirs great waves,
the three forms of suffering.
How long?
I could wander around this sea forever; the torch would
spin, and the circle of light would blaze.

What should I see?
Think on this, and see that the afflictions of the mind
are the one true enemy.
What must be done?
The enemy of living for this life must die.
Who shall do it?
You will have to pretend that you are warrior enough to
be the one.
When will it come?
Your foes, the afflictions in your mind, have always
been there waiting, ready for the battle.
Now then?
The time has surely come: go forth now and defeat them.

As the lines point out, there is one thing which acts as the very root of all our
sufferings here in the circle of life. This is none other than the enemy of the
mental afflictions, so dearly cherished by us, so close to our hearts.

Listen to these descriptions of suffering life, first from the lips of the Victor,

You can't be sure you will live,
Nor fix the time you die;
This monster, the Lord of Death,
Has no interest
To come at your convenience.
The four elements of your physical body
And your mind
Could go today their separate ways;
Think about it:
Can you ever feel secure,
Can you ever feel at peace?

He adds other lines including:
This devil, greed,
Collected money
Ignoring all comfort
And hardship to do so;
But we have no power
To carry even
A bit with us that day.
What's the use of money,
That's never there

Our friends and family
Stayed with us
Through thick and thin;
We won and kept them
By fitting in,

What's the use of family, friends,

You must have the training

Once you see

Then use your watchfulness,
Constantly check

To stop any wrong to come.
Recollect yourself,
Take the greatest care,
Have a sense of shame,
And consideration;
Use them on

Use your strength
To rein him in,
For this is the state of mind

However you wish it to be;
And this is why

The essential points of the entire teaching of the victorious Buddha, the meaning
of the contents of the three collections of the Word, all this is included within
three precious, extraordinary forms of training: the trainings of morality, of
meditative concentration, and wisdom. The crux on which the latter two
trainings turn, their basis, their root and the ground they stand upon, is in the
main a single item: morality, in the form of the various vows of freedom. As
the great Panchen Lama, Lobsang Chukyi Gyaltsen has said,

DE YANG PAn CHEN BLO BZANG CHOS KYI RGYAL MTSAN GYI ZHAL NAS, SNGON CHAD BCAS RKYANG PHRO MO DU MA LA, , 'DI TZAM 'DAS KYANG NYA PA CHUNG SNYAM DU, , BSAM ZHING DE DANG 'GAL BA DU MA BYAS, , LEGS PAR BRTAGS NA DE LTAR SEMS PA DE, , BDE 'GRO'I SROG RTZA GCOD PA'I GSHED MAR 'DUG,
It all begins
When you think to yourself
"It won't hurt much
If I break a few
Of these minor vows
In a minor way";
Before too long
You have gone against
A great many of your vows.
If you really think about it,
This kind of attitude
Is like a butcher
Who comes to
Rip out the life
Of your future higher birth.

The point here is that, if something so small as breaking a single minor vow
can escalate so far, then needless to say when we amass a collection of even
greater transgressions it's only proper that it would eventually lead us
precisely to one of the three lower realms--to a kind of pain which is totally
beyond our ability to withstand it.

Now the Sutra that Viradatta Requested says,

The book called The Bodhisattva's Life too has lines like the following:
All the other
Kinds of virtue
Are like a bamboo tree;
They give their fruits
And then they always
Die and go away.

But the Wish
For Buddhahood
Is an evergreen that always
Gives forth its fruits,
And instead of fading
Flourishes even more.

Bless me to see clearly
That the Wish itself
Is not enough,
For if I'm not well trained

Suppose you are able, as described above, to reach the Wish for enlightenment,
where you truly hope to achieve the state of a Buddha in order to help every
living being. This itself is not enough. Once you do reach the Wish, you must
still take on the vows of these bodhisattva princes and princesses, these sons

and daughters of the victorious Buddhas. And then you must train yourself
in giving and the other five perfections. Otherwise there is no way you could
ever come to enlightenment.

Grant that I may quickly gain
The path where quietude
And insight join together;
One which quiets

The other which analyzes

The verse here speaks of objects which are "wrong"; this should be understood
as referring to objects which are mistaken, in a particular sense. One example
would be trying to develop meditative concentration by fixing the mind on a
short stick of wood, as some non-Buddhists advocate. We must seek to "quiet"
the mind--that is, stop the mind--from being distracted to these types of wrong,
external objects.

There are Tibetan schools of the past too which have taught that meditative
quietude consisted of not thinking about anything at all, just keeping the mind
in some dark state of dullness. The high state of perfect insight then they
explain as moving in this stupor to a realization of the pure and simple
emptiness of the deceptive nature of the mind--except they describe this
emptiness as what you come to when you analyze whether or not what we call
the "mind" consists of any shape or color, and then fail to find that it's any
such thing.

RGYAL TSAB BYAMS PA'I DBUS MTHA' RNAM 'BYED KYI MAN NGAG RJE'I LAM RIM CHE CHUNG SOGS LAS GSUNGS PA LTAR   
But none of these ideas is correct; rather, we must follow texts such as the
briefer and more expanded explanations of the Steps to the path composed by
the Lord himself, where he presents the instructions given by the Great Regent,
Loving One, in his own work entitled Separating the Middle and the Extremes.

   NYES PA LNGA SPONG ZHING , GNYEN PO 'DU BYED BRGYAD BSTEN PA DANG , YID BYED BZHI DANG LDAN PA'I SEMS GNAS PA DGU RIM BZHIN BSGRUBS TE,
These treatises describe how one progresses in steps by eliminating the five
problems to meditation, taking the eight corrective actions, and achieving the
nine mental states, complete with their four different modes.

DGE BA'I DMIGS RNAM GANG RUNG ZHIG LA RTZE GCIG TU BZHAG PAS LUS SEMS SHIN SBYANGS KYI DGA' BA DES DRANGS PA'I ZHI GNAS DANG ,
One thus attains a kind of bliss, a total pliancy of body and mind, which comes
from staying in one-pointed meditation on any virtuous object one chooses.
This then leads to what we call meditative quietude.

The phrase "perfect meaning" here in the verse refers to a particular object: the
fact that nothing has any nature of its own. A kind of wisdom used for
examining the nature of something analyzes this object in a certain correct way,
and by the end of its analysis comes to a definite conclusion. The mind stays
in meditation upon this truth, such that the analysis and a fixation on this
object join and work together. This brings on a feeling of bliss that fills the
mind completely--and one has thus achieved what we call "perfect insight."

We seek to practice this process, where quietude and insight are no longer
separated one from the other. When we recite the verse we are asking our
Lama to grant that, as a result, we may quickly gain within our minds that
exceptional form of realization where meditative quietude and perfect insight
join together.

You must first have practiced well the general Steps of the path which are
"shared" by both the open and the secret teachings; that is, which are so
important for both that you could never succeed without them. More
specifically, you must have trained your mind well in the three principal paths:
renunciation, the Wish for enlightenment, and the correct view of reality. On
top of this you must have as your motivation a very fierce desire to reach
enlightenment for the sake of every living being. These then make you a vessel
that is worthy to enter the Way of the Secret Word.

When this time has come you must surely enter the "Way of the Diamond";
which is to say, this Way of the Secret Word. It is the highest of all the
"different ways"--the ways of the listeners, the self-made Buddhas, and the
bodhisattvas. What makes the Diamond Way higher is that is has certain
unique features, such as using the goal of practice as a path to the goal.

The Tibetan word for "diamond" here is dorje. This is a translation of the
Sanskrit word vajra--a term that has the basic meaning of "inseparable." The
"diamond" here is the actual diamond of the holy mind of the Buddha; that
deep state of meditation which can only be compared to a diamond. You can
also say it refers to that one type of wisdom which is the inseparable
combination of what we call "method" (great bliss) and "wisdom" (emptiness).

The word for "way" here has a meaning of "conveyance"--something you get
on and ride to reach a destination. The "diamond way" mentioned here is thus
a kind of "diamond conveyance" as well. In the way of the perfections, one
must carry on his practice for three "countless" eons in order to reach

foot, rather than travelling on any sort of conveyance.

If though you use the Diamond Way, the Way of the Secret Word, no such
length of time is needed: you can attain the state of secret Buddhahood, Union,
in the length of but one lifetime--even in one of the very short kinds of life
that we have here now, in the age of degeneration. In fact it's possible to reach
Buddhahood in no more than three years and three months. This way then is
a method which is incredibly deep and quick; more like riding a fine racehorse.

What is the "holiest" (meaning highest) door, or gateway, for bodhisattvas for
these people who are so fortunate and good--to come inside this path? It is
receiving the four empowerments of the Diamond Way, the Way of the Secret
Word, and receiving them perfectly, so that they are sure to plant the seeds for
the four bodies of a Buddha.
What we are requesting in this verse then, said our Lama, is that our Lama
grant us the ability to enter, with perfect ease, the profound path just described:
the Way of the Diamond, the unsurpassed form of the Secret Word.

The cause that gives me

Now suppose you have entered thus--you have made yourself a vessel which
is worthy of the Diamond Way, the Way of the Secret Word; and you have
received, in the proper manner, the four different empowerments. If you then
follow the correct method you can gain both the attainments: the one we call the
"ultimate," and the one we describe as "shared."

MCHOG GI DNGOS GRUB MI SLOB PA'I ZUNG 'JUG RGYAL BA RDO RJE 'CHANG GI GO 'PHANG DANG ,
The ultimate attainment is reaching secret Union, where there is nothing more
to be learned. This is the state of the Victorious One, the Keeper of the
Diamond.

The shared attainments are those such as the "eight great attainments." These
include the special powers known as the sword, the eye ointment, swift feet,
the pill, passing underground, disappearing, taking essence, and sky walking.

What then is it that can give you these attainments? Their cause or foundation,
the very support that holds them all up, is one thing, and only one: to keep
most pure every one of the root and secondary pledges and vows which you took
upon yourself when you were granted the empowerments.

The immense power of the purity of your pledges and vows will lead you over
the string of your future lives to attain a very special kind of life, where you
can practice the secret teachings. You will always meet an authentic Diamond
Master--one who teaches you the secret way. And you will always find
yourself able to put the secret paths into actual practice.

As such you will, without a doubt, be able to reach total enlightenment within
seven lifetimes, or in sixteen at the very most. On this our Teacher, the Keeper
of the Diamond, has spoken the following in the Tantra of the Treasure of Secrets:
 , DBANG BSKUR YANG DAG SBYIN LDAN NA, , SKYE DANG SKYE BAR DBANG BSKUR 'GYUR, , DE YIS SKYE BA BDUN LA NI, , MA BSGOMS PAR YANG DNGOS GRUB THOB,

Even if the person
Does not meditate.

One may wonder, "Suppose I am able to maintain my vows and pledges; what
must I do after that?" The highest of Victors, Kelsang Gyatso, has spoken the
following:
The point
May be birth or death or the state between them.
The time
Most important for planting their seeds is now.

The way
To transform them is the practice of creation and completion.
The refuge
You must learn is the three final bodies themselves.

What's being said here is that, first of all, you must continue to keep each and
every one of the secret vows and pledges, as explained above. Then you must
practice the very essence of the great sea of the secret ways. Here first is the
stage of creation, which is exemplified by a number of methods.

We tend to see things in an ordinary way, we take them to be no more than
what they seem to us; we tend to grasp this way to the place where we live,
to our own body, to the things we own and use, and to things like the parts
that make up us, and the world: what we call the "heaps," the "categories," and
the "doors of sense." We have also always had to undergo an ordinary birth,
ordinary death, and ordinary passage between death and birth.

In the stage of creation we transform all these seemingly ordinary things and
events; we turn them into the three bodies of a victorious Buddha. We take
whatever presents itself to us: all that appears to our eyes, all that reaches our
ears, and all that comes in our thoughts, and we make it show itself as total
and absolute purity, as a galaxy of perfection, as great celestial mansions, as
holy angels, as a magical dance put on by our Lamas.

RTZA RLUNG BSGOM PA TZAM LA CHED CHER BYAS TE GTUM MO PHAL PA 'BAR BA TZAM DANG , SEMS GSAL RIG GI NGO BO MTHONG BA TZAM LA LAM MTHON BOR 'KHRUL BA LTA BU   
As for the stage of completion, some mistakenly equate it with concentrating
solely on a meditation that involves the various channels and winds, and
which results in achieving a rather ordinary kind of inner heat. Others make
the error of thinking it is some high spiritual path when you succeed in
nothing more than perceiving how the essence of the mind is that it is aware
and knowing.

The real stage of completion though is not like this; rather, you take the
various winds which course through the body because of one's ordinary
conceptual thinking, and redirect them all into the central channel--in a
three-fold process of entrance, residence, and absorption. As a result a primal
state of mind arises, the clear light, the wisdom which is simultaneous. And
the power of this wisdom makes all of existence appear as the play of bliss and
emptiness.

In the path of the stage of completion then we meditate over and over on this
and related practices, until finally we are able to bring about the Union of the
holy body and holy mind: we reach the state of the Lord of the Secret World,
the Keeper of the Diamond.

The Asian Classics Institute
Course XVI: The Great Ideas of Buddhism, Part One
Reading Seven: The Proof of Future Lives, Part One
The following selection on the proof of future lives is excerpted from Light for the
Path to Freedom (Thar-lam gsal-byed, ACIP electronic text S5450), written by
Gyaltsab Je Darma Rinchen (1364-1432), an eminent disciple of the great Tsongkapa
(1357-1419). The text is an explanation of the Commentary on Valid Perception
(Pramana Varttika, ACIP text T4210), composed by Master Dharmakirti in about
650 AD.

The Purpose of Logic: Not Judging Others

Here is the third division, [on the purpose served by the reasoning where one
proves the non-existence of something which does not appear]. A sutra states
the following:
I or someone like myself can judge a person, but no normal person
should judge another, for he will fall.
This statement itself expresses the purpose of the reasoning. What the Buddha
is saying here is that:

Without being able to see the real condition, you should never
say anything even close to "This person has such and such faults.
This person hasn't the least good quality"--or "He or she has
some good qualities, but nothing more than that."

We never know who might be a holy being, and every open and secret
scripture there is says that the very finest way to end up in an unbearable birth
within the realms of misery is to speak badly about a holy being. Every
person who has any intelligence should therefore act with extreme caution in
this regard; treat such matters as though you were walking on the edge of a
great pit of glowing embers, innocently covered with powder of ash.

The implication suggested by the sutra above, and by the great treatises which
comment upon it, is that we must try to keep an attitude of wanting to help
all living creatures, of wanting to assure their happiness. So try to remain in
that pure vision where you see only pure good in other people. If you are not
capable of this, then at least it would be nice if you could try to speak badly
of others a little less than you do now.

A Bit on the History of Buddhist Logic
The next selection is from the English introduction to the Jewel of the True Thought
(Tsad-ma dgongs-rgyan, ACIP text S0023), a modern commentary on valid perception
by Geshe Yeshe Wangchuk, an eminent scholar from Sera Mey Tibetan Monastery.

Subject of the Work
The study of valid perception is of vital importance in Buddhist philosophy,
for it is this perception which allows us to determine the real nature of the
world around us and thereby escape pain, whether it be in the form of a mild
headache, or anxiety, or any undesirable object at all, on up to death itself.
This real nature of the world must be perceived not only with our direct
physical and mental senses, but by indirect methods such as reasoning, which
allows our minds to see important concepts such as the benefit of being moral.
Therefore the study of perception is tied to the study of reasoning, or
logic--and these form the core of the subject matter of the Commentary on Valid
Perception, the classical text which this book explains.
The Commentarial Tradition
The Commentary on Valid Perception (Prama¯n¸ava¯rttika, or Tsad-ma rnam-'grel) is
a work in four chapters by the Indian Buddhist master, Dharmakrti. As with
many early Buddhist sages, we know little of his life or even the dates that he
lived; Western scholars place him at around 630 AD, although even this is
uncertain. The "valid perception" in the title of his masterwork refers to
another treatise, the Compendium on Valid Perception (Prama¯n¸asamuccaya, or Tsad-
ma kun-btus), and Master Dharmakrti's text is actually a defense of this piece.
The Compendium was itself composed by Master Dignga, who is considered
the father of the Buddhist logic traditions and is dated by Western scholars at
around 440 AD, although again there is considerable uncertainty, and
according to tradition he was a direct teacher of Master varasena, who is said
to have been the direct teacher of Master Dharmakrti.
The philosopher Dignga was for his part commenting upon the concepts of
perception and logic presented in the teachings of kyamuni Buddha, who
lived 500 BC. And so the lineage goes from the Buddha, to Master Dignga,
to Master Dharmakrti, and then on to the early Indian explanations of Master
Dharmakrti, including his own autocommentary.
Looking backwards from our present time, it is typical for a modern Tibetan
commentator of the Gelukpa tradition to base his work on one of the monastic
textbooks, typically written in the 17th or 18th century for the curriculum of
a specific monastic college. These textbooks are themselves based on a
preceding generation of commentaries composed in the 15th century by
Tsongkapa the Great (1357-1419) or by one of the scholars of his immediate
school.

Here two important works are the Jewel of Reasoning (Tsad-ma rigs-rgyan) of the
First Dalai Lama, Gyalwa Gendun Drup (1391-1474), and Light on the Path to
Freedom (Thar-lam gsal-byed) by Gyaltsab Je (1362-1432), who was the great first
regent of Je Tsongkapa's school. These texts are based on the Indian
commentaries to Master Dharmakrti's work, and thus the entire commentarial
tradition stretches through 25 centuries, from kyamuni Buddha up to the
great Tibetan philosophical masters of our own time.

Master Dignaga's Opening Statement
For the next selection we return to Geshe Yeshe Wangchuk's Jewel of the True
Thought.

,DE YANG RTZA BA'I SA BCAD GNYIS PA NGES BYA'I THAR PA DANG THAMS CAD MKHYEN PA DANG DER BGROD PA'I LAM BSHAD PA LA GNYIS, SPYI'I DON DANG , YAN LAG GI DON NO,
This chapter begins from the second major point of the outline to the entire
work; this is the explanation of what it is we seek to perceive: freedom and the
state of all-knowing, and the path that will take us there. Here there are two
divisions--the main subject, and certain secondary subjects.

,DANG PO LA GSUM, SLOB DPON PHYOGS GLANG GI BSHAD PA DGOD PA DANG , DE'I DON RNAM 'GREL MDZAD PAS JI LTAR BKRAL BA'I TSUL DANG , DE DAG GI DGONGS PA'O,
There are three parts to the main subject; these are showing what it was that
Master Dignaga stated, describing how the author of the Commentary explained
what he stated, and demonstrating the true intent of each.

,DANG PO NI, SLOB DPON PHYOGS GLANG GI BSHAD PA DGOD PA NI, TSAD MA KUN BTUS LAS,
Here is the first. The following is the classical statement by Master Dignaga:

,TSAD MAR GYUR PA 'GRO LA PHAN BZHED PA,
,STON PA BDE GSHEGS SKYOB LA PHYAG 'TSAL TE,
,RTOG GE NGAN 'KHRUL 'GRO BA LA BRTZE BAS,

I bow down to the One who turned correct,
Who helps all beings, the Teacher,
The one who went to bliss,
And our Protector.

And now out of love
For those mistaken in their logic
I shall explain the right way
To establish correct perception.

,ZHES MCHOD BRJOD DANG BRTZOMS PAR DAM BCA' BA YIN PAR THAR LAM GSAL BYED DU GSAL BA   
As elucidated in the Light on the Path to Freedom, these lines present the offering
of praise and the pledge to compose the work. . .

Proving that the Buddhas are Totally Correct
We read again from the Jewel of the True Thought:

,THUB PA TSAD MAR BSGRUB PA LA GNYIS, LUGS 'BYUNG GI SGO NAS STON PA LAM GANG NAS BYON PA'I TSUL BSTAN PA DANG , LUGS LDOG GI SGO NAS DE LTAR BYON PA'I SHES BYED BSTAN PA'O,
Proving that the Able One is totally correct has two parts. The first is to show
what path it was that He came by; this involves the forward order. The second
is to show the evidence to establish that he did come this way; this involves
the reverse order.

,DANG PO LA, TSAD MAR GYUR PA'I DON BSHAD PA'I SGO NAS TSAD MA'I SKYES BU'I MTSAN GZHI NGOS GZUNG BA DANG , LHAG MA BZHI BSHAD PA'I SGO NAS TSAD MA'I SKYES BU'I MTSAN NYID DANG , DER BGROD PA'I LAM NGOS GZUNG BA'O,
The first of these has three parts of its own. The first is identifying a typical
example of a person who is totally correct, by explaining the meaning of the
words "Who turned correct." The second is to identify the definition of a
person who is totally correct, which is done by explaining the remaining four
elements of the statement. And the third is to identify the path by which one
travels to this state.

,DANG PO LA, TSAD MA SPYI'I MTSAN NYID DANG , THUB PA'ANG MTSAN NYID DE DANG LDAN PAR BSTAN PA'O, , DANG PO LA, MTSAN NYID KYI NGO BO DANG , KHYAD PAR RO,
The first of these has as well two sections. The first is the definition of correct
perception in general. The second is a demonstration that this definition does
moreover apply to the Able One. Our discussion of the definition itself will
proceed in two steps: the essence of the definition, and a detail of the
definition.

,DANG PO LA, MTSAN NYID DANG , MTSAN GZHI DANG MTSAN GZHI LA MTSAN NYID NGES BYED DO, DANG PO LA, MI SLU BA NGOS GZUNG BA DANG , DE LA MA KHYAB PA SPANG BA DANG , KHYAB CHES PA SPANG BA'O,
The essence of the definition is itself divided into the definition, a typical
example, and establishing that the definition applies to this example. For the
definition we will first have to identify what it means to be "unerring," then
refute that it might not be comprehensive, and finally refute that it could be
too comprehensive.

,MI SLU BA NGOS GZUNG BA LA, RTZA BA LAS,
,TSAD MA BSLU MED CAN SHES PA,
,DON BYED NUS PAR GNAS PA NI,
,MI 
The identification of what it means to be "unerring" is found in two and a half
lines of the root text:
Correct perception is a state of mind unerring;
To be in a condition able to perform a function
Is what "unerring" means.

SLUZHES PA'I TSIG PHYED DANG GSUM STE, SKYES BU'I MNGON MTHO DANG NGES LEGS BSGRUB PA'I THABS DANG BCAS PA NI TSAD MA'I GZHAL BYA YIN ZHING , DE DAG THAMS CAD LA THUB 
PA NYID MI SLU BA YIN PAS SPYIR TSAD MA'I MTSAN NYID DE GANG ZHE NA, GSAR DU BSLU BA MED PA CAN GYI SHES PA DE, TSAD MA'I MTSAN NYID DANG ,
The thing that correct perception undertakes to perceive is the existence of and
the means for a person to attain a birth in the higher realms, as well as definite
good. The Able One is the one being who is unerring with regard to all of
these things; and so, if you should wonder how correct perception is defined,
we can state that "a fresh state of mind which is unerring" is the definition of
correct perception.

MI SLU BA'I DON YANG , BTZO BSREG LA SOGS PA'I DON BYED NUS PAR SHES PA DES JI LTAR RTOGS PA LTAR DON LA GNAS PA DE'O,
And what is the meaning of "unerring"? Suppose you perceive something as
being able to perform the function of cooking or burning something else.
Your perception is "unerring" when this thing does actually exist in the
condition you have perceived it to be.
6
Details of Correct or Valid Perception
The next selection again comes from Jewel of the True Thought:

   , GNYIS PA MTSAN NYID KYI KHYAD PAR NI RTZA BAR,
,MA SHES DON GYI GSAL BYED KYANG ,
,RANG GI NGO BO RTOGS 'OG TU,
,SPYI'I RNAM PAR SHES PA THOB,
,RANG GI MTSAN NYID MI SHES PA,
,SHES PA GANG YIN ZHES DGONGS PHYIR,
,RANG GI MTSAN NYID DPYAD PHYIR RO,
. . .Here secondly is a detail of the definition, which is indicated in six lines
from the root text:
It must also illuminate something not perceived.
Subsequent to perceiving the thing in its very essence,
You have a more general type of experience.
It's because the intent when they mention a perception
Is one that has not perceived a definitive object.
Because it discerns its own definitive object.

,ZHES TSIG DRUG GONG DU BSHAD PA'I MI SLU BA TZAM GYIS TSAD MA'I MTSAN NYID YONGS SU MI RDZOGS TE, SNGAR MA SHES PA'I DON GYI GSAL BYED DE DANG PO'AM GSAR DU SHES PAS KYANG MTSAN NYID KYI ZUR DU SMOS DGOS PA'I PHYIR, DES NA, GSAR DU MI SLU BA'I SHES PA, TSAD MA'I MTSAN NYID YIN NO,
What this is saying is that the requirement described above, that a perception
be "unerring," is not by itself enough to complete the entire definition of correct
perception. This is because the perception must be one which illuminates
something that was not perceived previously; and so we must also mention
at some point in the definition that the object is known "for the first time," or
"freshly." As such, the standard definition for correct perception is "a fresh and
unerring perception."

,DON GSAR DU GSAL BYED TSAD MA YIN NA, SNGON PO NGES PA'I BCAD SHES CHOS CAN, TSAD MA YIN PAR THAL, GSAR DU RTOGS PA'I SHES PA YIN PA'I PHYIR, DER THAL, SNGON PO'I DON SPYI GSAR DU RTOGS PA'I SHES PA YIN PA'I PHYIR ZHE NA,
Someone might make the following objection. "Suppose we allow you to
define correct perception as a fresh illumination of an object. Consider then
a recollection in which you perceive the color blue. According to you,
wouldn't this have to be a correct perception? Because isn't it a state of mind
which realizes its object and is fresh? And it is just that, for it is a state of
mind which is a fresh perception of the mental image of the color blue."

Yet there is no such problem. What happens is that the state of mind which
grasps the color blue directly perceives that very essence of blueness which is
unique to it. Subsequent to this perception you have a more general
experience, where your mind grasps to a mental image of the color blue. This
latter state of mind though does not have the ability to discern the object on
its own power alone. If something is correct perception, it must be a fresh
perception of a definitive object that it has not perceived before, or else must
be directly dependent upon such a perception. Incidentally, you should
understand the phrase "definitive object" here as referring to an object as it
exists in its own essence.

Showing that the Buddha
Has the Qualities of Correct Perception

Here secondly we show that the qualities of correct perception are as well
possessed by the victorious Buddha. We proceed in two steps: bridging this
explanation to the meaning of correct perception already presented, and
explaining the meaning of the words "who turned." The first of the two is
conveyed in the root text with the line,
The one who has it is the Victorious One;
Perfectly correct itself.

GCIG,THUB PA BCOM LDAN 'DAS CHOS CAN, CHOS THAMS CAD LA TSAD MA YIN TE, DE THAMS CAD LA GSAR DU MI SLU BA'I SHES PA DE DANG LDAN ZHING DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Consider the Victorious One, the able Buddha. He is perfectly correct
towards each and every existing object, for He is the one who has "it": that is,
who has a fresh and unerring perception of all these objects, and who is that
itself.

The main point here is to show that omniscience is a correct perception which
sees directly, and on its own power, each and every existing object: the nature
of all things, and the totality of all things. And the Buddha is as well a being
who possesses this omniscience. Incidentally, this fact also disproves the belief
that realized persons who are Buddhas do not possess the mental function of
wisdom.

At this juncture, Light on the Path to Freedom and a number of monastic
textbooks present the following argument. The wording of the root text
implies that there exists some object which is not seen by the first moment of
omniscience, but which is seen fresh by the second moment of omniscience.
Suppose that one therefore accepts such an object. Consider this object. Isn't

it true that it must be seen by the first moment of omniscience? Because isn't
it something that is? And isn't this necessarily so, since the first moment of
omniscience is a kind of wisdom which perceives, directly, each and every
existing object? And isn't this so, since it is omniscience? And suppose you
say that just because something is omniscience doesn't mean it perceives
directly each and every object. What then about the quotation [from the Jewel
of Realizations by Master Asanga] which states, "It is the path which is the one
knowledge of each and every kind of object"?

Suppose now you disagree to our original statement, [where we said that the
object is something which is.] Consider again this object [which is supposedly
not seen by the first moment of omniscience but is seen by the second
moment]. It is true that it is, for it is an object which is perceived fresh by
omniscience of the second moment. If you say it is not, then you contradict
your own position.

Our own textbooks, in the section on the study of the mind, define recollection
as "A state of mind where you perceive what you have already perceived
before." The textbooks of certain other monasteries say that the definition of
recollection is "A state of mind which is not correct perception, and where you
perceive what you have already perceived before." Light on the Path to Freedom
says,
No matter how much we look within ourselves and think it over,
we cannot detect any case where omniscience could be anything
other than correct perception, or where there could be any case
of correct perception that were not a fresh perception.

If you consider this quotation carefully, you can see that it is stating that the
second and following moments of omniscience are fresh perceptions towards
their objects.

If the first moment of omniscience does not see the past, present, and future
all at once, then there could be no wisdom which sees all these three times at
once. If it does see these three, then it would have to see all objects which are
going to occur in the future. As such there could be no object which the
second and following moments perceived which had not already been
perceived before, or which the first moment had not perceived. Therefore our
own position is that the group of things which are discerned by the first
moment of omniscience and the group of things which are discerned by the
second moment of omniscience are completely identical.

One may then make the following objection:
If that's the case, then let's consider the second moment of
omniscience. Isn't it then a state of mind which perceives
something which it has already perceived before? Because isn't
the only thing it perceives then exactly the same thing which has
already been perceived by the first moment of omniscience?

Our answer is that it doesn't necessarily follow. Although it is true that the
second moment of omniscience does perceive what it does in the way
described, it does not engage in its object by force of the first moment of
omniscience, but rather perceives its object on its own power.

What it Means to Have "Turned" Correct

,GNYIS PA GYUR PA'I DON BSHAD PA LA, GYUR PA SMOS PA'I DGOS PA DANG , DE LA RTZOD SPANG NGO , , DANG PO LA, RTZA BAR 
,MA SKYES PA NI BZLOG DON DU,
,GYUR PA NYID GSUNGS DE YI PHYIR,
,SGRUB BYED LA LTOS TSAD YIN RIGS,
ZHES TSIGS GSUM,
Here secondly is our explanation of the meaning of the words "who turned."
First we will describe the necessity for mentioning "who turned," and then after
that discuss some objections to this description. The first point here is covered
in the following three lines of the root text:
The phrase that goes "who turned"
Is spoken in the sense
Of the opposite of something
Which wasn't ever developed.
This as well is why it's right
That correctness depends on achieving.

,SLOB DPON PHYOGS GLANG GIS, TSAD MA KUN BTUS KYI MCHOD BRJOD DU TSAD MAR GYUR PA ZHES SMOS PA LA, RNAM BCAD KYI DGOS PA NI, TSAD MA'I SKYES BU DE RANG GI RGYU LAS MA SKYES PA LDOG PA'I DON DU GYUR PA GSUNG PA'I PHYIR,
There are two reason why Master Dignaga, in the verse of the offering of
praise at the beginning of his work, the Compendium on Correct Perception,
mentions the phrase "who turned." The first purpose for these words is the
kind that is meant to exclude something. Here they are spoken in the sense
of the opposite: they are meant to indicate that a person who is totally correct
could never be something that didn't ever develop from its proper cause.

,YONGS GCOD KYI DGOS PA NI, THABS SHES KYI SGRUB BYED GOMS PA MTHAR PHYIN PA LA BLTOS NAS TSAD MAR 'KHRUNGS PA GO BA'I CHED YIN PA'I PHYIR,
The second purpose for these words is the kind that is meant to imply
something. Here the point we are supposed to grasp is that one develops into
a person of total correctness only by depending on reaching the final
perfection of a gradual practice of all the various methods used for achieving
this state.

Disproving Wrong Ideas

Here secondly is our refutation of arguments against our position. We will
proceed in two steps: disproving the idea that someone who created every
knowable thing could be an omniscient being, and proving that someone who
could perceive directly the actual way in which each and every knowable thing
exists is an omniscient being.

DANG PO LA, THAMS CAD KYI BYED PO'I DBANG PHYUG GI NGO BO DGAG PA DANG , SGRUB BYED DGAG PA'O,
The first of these two has two steps itself: disproving the very nature of some
Lord of Power who created every knowable thing, and disproving the
attempted proofs for his existence.

10
Disproving the Idea of a Creator

DANG PO LA, RTAG PA DGAG PA DANG , MI RTAG PA YIN PA DGAG PA'O, , RTAG PA YIN PA DGAG PA LA,
The first of these has two parts: disproving a Lord of Power who is
unchanging, and disproving one who is changing.
Disproving a Lord of Power who is unchanging is presented in the following
seven lines of the root text by Master Dharmakirti:

RTZA BAR, , TSAD MA RTAG PA NYID YOD MIN,
,DNGOS YOD RTOGS PA TSAD PHYIR DANG ,
,SHES BYA MI RTAG PA NYID KYIS,

,RIM BZHIN SKYE BA CAN DAG NI,
,RTAG LAS SKYE BA MI 'THAD PHYIR,
,BLTOS PA MI RUNG BA YI PHYIR,
,ZHES TSIG BDUN,
A correct perception which exists
as unchanging could never be;
This is because it's a correct perception
towards something that's a working thing.
And since the thing it knows
is something which is changing,

It too can only be something
which has no stability.
It's true as well since things that arise
in stages gradually
Could never be something that arises
from a thing that is unchanging,
And neither could they properly be
things which must depend.

GZHAN SDES THAMS CAD KYI BYED PA PO DBANG PHYUG RTAG PA RANG BYUNG GI TSAD MA'I SKYES BU YIN NO ZHE NA, LHA DBANG PHYUG DE THAMS CAD LA TSAD MAR KHAS LEN PAS, YUL DNGOS POR YOD PA RTOGS PA'I TSAD MA YIN DGOS,
Some other groups say that there is a being who created every existing thing:
the Lord of Power, who is unchanging. He, they say, is a being who is totally
correct, and who just came that way from the beginning. Now since these
groups assert that this powerful deity is a being with correct perception
towards every existing thing, they must agree that he has correct perception
towards objects of his mind which are working things.

DE YIN NA, TSAD MA RTAG PA NYID DU YOD PA MIN TE, YUL MI RTAG PA RTOGS PA'I PHYIR, KHYAB STE, YUL SHES BYA MI RTAG PA NYID YIN NA, , DE 'JAL GYI TSAD MA DE MI BRTAN PA NYID YIN DGOS PA'I PHYIR,
Suppose he did have such a perception. This correct perception--which exists
as something unchanging--could never be, because it perceives an object of
the mind which is changing. This is always the case, for if the thing it
knows--the object of the mind--is something which is changing, then it too
(the correct perception which engages in this object) can only be something
which has no stability.

Now suppose you say that this Lord of Power is himself unchanging. Since
you agree that the mind of this Lord is changing, you must agree that his mind
arises. And yet this mind could never arise from a Lord of Power who was
unchanging, because it arises in stages, gradually. Neither could the mind
arise through dependence on certain conditions, for nothing which is
unchanging can properly be a thing which must depend on something else.

The Great Commentary, Ocean of Reasoning, presents some additional points
here. It is a contradiction for the subject mind to be unchanging if the object
it perceives is changing; but on the other hand it is not necessarily the case
that, just because the object the mind perceives is unchanging, the subject mind
itself must be unchanging.

YUL CAN DES, YUL RTOGS PA DE DUS RTAG TU 'JAL LAM RES 'GA' 'JAL, RTAG TU 'JAL NA, YUL DE'ANG RTAG TU YOD PAR 'GYUR BAS MI RTAG PA YIN PA 'GAL,
This is because of the following. When the subject mind perceives its object,
does it engage in the object all the time, or does it engage in the object
intermittently? If it engages all the time, then the object would have to be
there all the time, which is a contradiction, since the object is changing.

RE 'GA' 'JAL NA, YUL RTOGS PA DE RGYU RKYEN LA BLTOS PAR 'GYUR BAS MI RTAG PA YIN DGOS SO, , YUL RTAG PA YIN NA'ANG YUL CAN RTAG PA YIN MI DGOS TE, YUL CAN GYIS YUL RTOGS PA RGYU RKYEN LA BLTOS PA'I PHYIR,
If you answer that the subject engages the object intermittently, then the
perception of the object must depend on certain factors, and so it would have
to be changing.

It is true that, even it the object is unchanging, the subject mind that perceives
it need not be unchanging. This is because the perception of the object by the
subject depends on certain causes and conditions.

Some people claim that what's being disproved at this point is a conventional
correct perception that was unchanging. Consider then ultimate perception.
According to you then there cannot be any changing thing which acts as its
object. Those schools here in the Land of Snow which assert that omniscience
is unchanging have come to a point of direct contradiction against the great
work of this Lord of Reasoning.

,RNAM 'AGS PHAN GDAGS BYA MIN PHYIR,
,MI RTAG NA YANG TSAD MED NYID,
,CES TSIG GNYIS,
Here secondly is how we deny a Lord of Power who is something that
changes. The root text presents the point in two lines:
Because there are not things at all
which help him any way,
There is no correct perception at all
even if he were changing.

GONG GI RIGS PA DE DAG MI BZOD NAS, DBANG PHYUG MI RTAG PA YIN YANG , 'KHOR BA'I DUS SU CHAGS SOGS NYAMS SU MYONG NAS, DE'I GNYEN PO GOMS PA'I SGRUB BYED LA BLTOS PA MIN PAR, THOG MA NAS CHAGS BRAL DANG KUN MKHYEN YIN NO ZER,
Suppose even that someone were unable to bear the above reasoning, and
claimed instead that the Lord of Power were changing. They would say that
he was from the very beginning a person free of all desire, and omniscient,
without having to go through the process of experiencing desire and all the
rest during his time in the circle of rebirth, and then depending on practices
wherein he meditated on the antidotes.

But isn't it true that there is no correct perception at all that can establish the
existence of a state of omniscience which has arisen from a Lord of Power of
the past who is of the same type? Because isn't it true that this Lord of Power
is someone who has never been harmed by the afflicted side of existence
during a period when he was living in the circle of rebirth; and someone who
has never been helped by the pure side of existence? Isn't it true that there are
no things at all that have affected him in any such way?

On these two lines, the Great Commentary starts from the reason that it is
incorrect to say that an unchanging thing could arise from certain conditions,
and proceeds to saying that, as far as the denial of being changing, the Lord
of Power is admittedly changing; but that it is incorrect to assert that he is
omniscient. Based on this presentation it seems a little delicate to call this
section the "denial of something that changes."

Here thirdly is the section on identifying what it is to be omniscient. The root
text of Master Chandrakirti says:
The thing that we agree to be
totally correct
Is the one who has knowledge of
the fact of what it is
That we should take up and give up,
and the method too;
It's not though one who knows
everything there is.
Whether or not He can see
to some so very great distance,
He is a person who has seen
the one goal that we wish.

If what it takes to qualify
is how far he can see,
Come then over here and take
the vulture as your Teacher.

Consider now the Able One, the Victorious Buddha, the One Gone Beyond.
It is right that all those who aspire for liberation should agree that He is totally
correct. This is because He has reached the ultimate point of knowledge where
He sees directly the causes for our getting trapped and for escaping: He sees
everything that we should take up (the end of suffering, and the path to it)
and everything we should give up (suffering and its source); and He sees the
method to follow here too.

It's not though that knowing every kind of thing there is, all the rocks and
tiny creatures at the bottom of the ocean, is all it takes to fulfill the wishes of
those who seek liberation.
It doesn't matter whether or not He can see to some so very great distance;
either way, the Teacher, the Transcendent Buddha, is the right one to take as
a teacher, for He is a person who has seen that one goal that those who seek
for freedom wish.

If what it takes to qualify as a person who is totally correct is nothing more
than how far one can see, then it would be proper to give the following advice
to people who are wishing to reach liberation:
Come then over here. It's true that a vulture is nothing but a
bird, but he does see to a very great distance; and so you should
take vultures or other such beings as your Teacher.

In everyday life, people talk about how it is some being that was able to make
the world who is the omniscient one. This verse though serves to identify the
real nature of an omniscient being, which is one who understands in totality
all the details of what one should take up, and what you should give up.

The one thing which is important, beyond all else, is to follow properly, in
your mind and in your deeds, a spiritual Guide who possesses the necessary

you, in exactly the right way, how to reach the goal that you desire. This
key--that is, what you really need to look for--is described with absolute
perfection by the Lord of Reasoning in the verse above.

The Four Reasonings of the Forward Order
The following "Four Reasonings of the Forward Order" have been written out for this
class presentation by Sermey Khen Rinpoche, Geshe Lobsang Tharchin. They are
found in ACIP electronic text S0073.

We turn now to the point in the text which treats the lines from the "Sutra" on
Correct Perception which include "The One who turned correct, who helps all
beings." Here two steps are presented towards proving that the Teacher is a
person who is totally correct: using the forward order to show what path the
Teacher came from; and using the reverse order, putting forth evidence that He
could have come this way.

Here is the first.
[First: the "Reasoning of the Protector," which proves turning totally correct:]

Consider our Teacher.
He is someone who turned correct,
Because He possesses the quality of being an unsurpassed Protector,
who by teaching the four noble truths protects each and every living
being from suffering.

[Second: the "Reasoning of Eliminating Undesirable Qualities--the One who

It is true that He possesses the quality of being an unsurpassed

Because he has eliminated undesirable qualities, totally.

[Third: the "Reasoning of the Teacher," which proves having gone to bliss:]
Consider the same One.
It is true that He has previously eliminated all undesirable qualities;
Because during His time on the paths of learning He has for the sake of
others acted in every way to practice continually on the subjects of
selflessness and so on, and because He has reached the final perfection
of this same practice.

[Fourth: the "Reasoning of Great Compassion," which proves being the

Consider the same One.

Because He has reached the final perfection of compassion.

[In summary,]
Consider this same One.
He is not a person who is totally correct and who is also unchanging,
who just came that way from the beginning;
Because He has turned this way by practicing, for a long period of time,
a great many methods that were both a part of the cycle of life and also
beyond it; and He did so over the course of many different kinds of
lives He has taken--driven all the while by His compassion.

An Explanation of the Perfected Thought
We return next to the Jewel of the True Thought, by Geshe Yeshe Wangchuk:

The root text of Master Dharmakirti says--

It comes from practicing perfectly
what helps bring Him about: holy compassion.
As for the things that help bring about a person who is totally correct, holy
great compassion comes first: that is, before. This is because you must become
the Teacher first by giving birth within yourself to the compassion which
wants to liberate every living being from suffering, and then by practicing
perfectly the method for liberating them from suffering.

This kind of holy great compassion, moreover, comes about through constant
practice of earlier and similar forms. The two phrases terms "holy great
compassion" and "great compassion" are explained as being the same in this
particular instance.

The autocommentary to Entering the Middle Way says:
They do not possess the great masses of merit and of wisdom,
nor holy great compassion, nor omniscience or the like.
Therefore they are less than totally enlightened Buddhas, and so
are said to be "medium."
The Analysis of the Middle Way from our monastery quotes this passage and
says that therefore not even bodhisattvas have holy great compassion in their
mind streams.

In the seventh chapter of the Treasure House of Knowledge (the Abhidharmakosha),
eight distinctions between great compassion and holy great compassion are set
forth. This text states that holy great compassion is found only in the mental
stream of a realized being who is a Buddha. As the root text of the Treasure
says,
The Buddha's great compassion, deceptive mind.
Because of collection, aspect, activity object,
Evenness, for greatness in the extreme.
Distinctions between them of eight different types.

According to all this then, the difference between holy great compassion and
great compassion is vast, and holy great compassion is no path which is
practiced at the outset of the path of the greater way.

In this same vein, the majority of the textbooks of the great monasteries state
that there is no great compassion in the mind stream of a practitioner of the
lesser way. Our own textbooks though establish that enemy destroyers of the
Listener type do possess great compassion in their mind-streams; they do so
by using a quotation from the Dar commentary to the Higher Line.

DE YANG , SEMS CAN SDUG BSNGAL LAS SKYOB 'DOD KYI SNYING RJE MED KYANG , SDUG BSNGAL LAS 'BRAL 'DOD KYI SNYING RJE CHEN PO YOD PA GSUNGS,
They state moreover that, although these enemy destroyers lack the kind of
compassion where they wish to protect living beings from suffering, they do
have the kind where they wish to see them free of suffering.

The text called The Explication which is a Light on the Path to Freedom says that
"This great compassion is the one thing that allows one to reach the start of the
practice of the path of the greater way."

The Great Commentary, the Ocean of Reasoning, also says:
Any person who is able to develop in the stream of his mind this
one thing, the great compassion that wishes to free each and
every living creature from suffering, has thereby become
someone whom we can speak of with the name "bodhisattva."

SNYING RJE CHEN PO NYID LUGS 'BYUNG GI SKABS SU THEG CHEN THUN MONG MA YIN PA'I LAM GYI THOG MAR BSHAD PA YIN NO,
It states as well that:
This one thing, great compassion, is explained in the section on the
forward order as being the beginning of the path for the unique path of
the greater way.

In addition, this same work states:
A certain attitude grows up in the bottom of one's heart; a totally
genuine state of mind where you wish to free every living being
from suffering. This very state of mind is what we call "holy
great compassion," or "great compassion."
As soon as this one thing has grown in your heart, then we speak
of you with the words "greater way." This state of mind is
moreover the starting point of the unique path, and a special
cause for achieving omniscience.

Great compassion therefore is explained as being the starting point for the path
of the greater way; and holy great compassion and great compassion are said
to be two different words for the same thing.

In the Greater Steps of the Path, the Sutra Requested by Ocean of Understanding is
first quoted. Then Lord Tsongkapa goes on to describe the example of a
family person with an especially beloved son who suddenly falls into a great
pit of filth. Even practitioners of the Listener and Self-Made Buddha types
possess a kind of compassion which is similar to the one that the boy's mother
and different relations feel, where they wish to pull him out of the pit. Only
a bodhisattva though, he says, possesses the kind of compassion which is like
the concern felt by the boy's father.

Judging from this description, our own monastery's textbooks appear to be
correct on this point. This is because compassion which is like the mother's
love for his son is had by Listeners and Self-Made Buddhas as well, and that
in itself satisfies entirely the definition of great compassion.

'ON KYANG , SNYING RJE'I SNGON DU GCES SHING PHANGS PA'I YID DU 'ONG BA'I BYAMS PA DANG , DRIN GZO DRIN DRAN, MAR SHES SOGS 'GRO DGOS PAS,
We should note though that prior to developing compassion one must go
through the steps of "beautiful" love, which cherishes and values its object; as
well as wanting to repay kindness, recalling kindness, realizing that they have
been your mother, and so on.

NYAN RANG LA DE DAG SGOM PA YOD MED DPYAD DGOS,
Whether or not Listeners and Self-Made Buddhas meditate on these various
steps is something we would have to investigate.

The first of these two is indicated in two lines of the root text:
Suppose you say that,

Is something that relies on the body,
there is no achieving by practice.

Those of the Charvaka School say:
Your statement that a person practices compassion over the
length of many lifetimes, and then turns into a person who is
totally correct, is wrong. This is because there are no past or
future lives, and awareness in the mind is something that relies
on the body.

They say that there are three ways in which the mind relies on the body. First
of all they say the mind is a quality of the body, similar to alcohol and the
ability to make someone drunk. Secondly mind is part of the nature of the
body, as with a wall and a design on the wall. Lastly the mind is a result of
the body, in the way of a lamp and its light.
And they say that, because the mind relies on the body, the awareness in the
mind dies when the body dies.

************

MKHAS GRUB KYI TSAD MA SDE BDUN YID KYI MUN SEL LAS,
We begin with an excerpt taken from Clearing Away Darkness of the Mind about
the Seven Books of Valid Perception, a text composed by Kedrup Je.

SKYES BU SKYES MA THAG GI RIG PA DE LA RGYU MED NA, RES 'GA' YIN PAS GNOD LA,
Suppose you say that the mind of a person who was just born has no cause.
You are disproven by the fact that this mind is variable.

Suppose thus that this mind does have a cause. Is this cause unchanging or
changing? If it were an unchanging thing that could perform some function,
then there would be no possibility that it did not apply in every place and at
every time; and so there would be no possibility of its having a fixed
relationship where it came and went according to its result.

PHYI MA LTAR NA, BEM RIG GANG RUNG LAS GZHAN PA'I DNGOS PO LAS SKYE BAR MI 'THAD PAS, GANG RUNG LAS SKYE DGOS LA,
Suppose then that the latter were true, [and that the cause of this mind were
changing.] It would be incorrect to say that this mind could arise from any
working thing other than matter or mind, and so it must come from one or the
other of these two.

BEM POS NYER LEN BYED NA, DBANG PO DANG BCAS PA'AM, PHYI ROL GYI BEM POS YIN,
Suppose you say that matter provides the material cause for this mind. Is it
the kind of matter which involves the powers of sense, or is it matter outside
of them?

Suppose you say it's the first of the two. Is this cause one where all the
various sense powers must come together, or is any one or combination of
them enough? If the first is the case, then mental consciousness would fail to
arise if the sense power of the eye were absent. If the latter is the case, then
one's thoughts would have to be able to capture visible objects with the same
kind of clarity that the consciousness of the eye does.

Suppose you say that it's outer matter which provides the material cause. Is
it matter in the sense of some substance which is a whole, or is it atoms?
Suppose you say it's the first. The substance which is a whole can only be
something with parts or something without parts.

Suppose you say it's a whole with parts that provides the material cause. We

enough?

Suppose you say that it's a substance which is a whole, and which has no
parts, and which exists distinct from its details, which provides the material
cause for the mind. Then when you covered your face with a piece of cloth all
the other details of your body would have to be covered as well. If the other
details didn't get covered then there would come to be two parts: one that was
covered and one that wasn't. These two parts, the covered one and the
uncovered one, would be something that applied to the details but not to the
whole that had the details. This being the case, you would have to be able to
see clearly the face of the whole even when the face as a detail was covered
with the cloth.

DE BZHIN DU G-YO MI G-YO DANG , KHA BSGYUR MA BSGYUR SOGS LA SBYAR BA'I RIGS PA RNAMS KYIS GNOD DO, ,
This position is equally disproven by reasoning that treats other distinctions,
such as moving one of your limbs or not, and turning to one side or not.

Suppose you say that atoms provide the material cause for the mind. If it's
that the mind arises through each of the atoms, acting independently of each
other, then many different mental consciousnesses would have to arise at the
same time. If it's that the atoms must act all together in a group, then the
mind could never arise if even a single atom were absent.

MTHA' GZHAN 'GOG PA'I RIGS PA DE DAG LA BRTEN NAS SHES PAS NYER LEN BYED PAR GRUB LA,
This reasoning, where we use the process of eliminating all other possibilities,
brings us to the conclusion that the material cause for mind is mind itself.

The mind that acts as the cause must moreover either be one which is part of
yourself or one which is part of someone else. Suppose you say that a mind
which is part of someone else, of someone like your father or mother, acts as
the direct material cause for this mind. The problem then arises that--where
the father is a skilled artisan, or say foolish, or whatever--the son must always
be this way as well.

RANG RGYUD KYI RIG PA SNGA MA KHO NAS NYER LEN BYED PAR 'GYUR LA,
This leads us to conclude that it can only be a former mind which is part of
our own stream of consciousness that provides the material cause [for our
mind as it exists just after we are born.]

This means that the past history and future continuation of our minds are

they are not dependent on something of their own type which has come before,

So if the powers and the mind and such could ever occur just from the elements,
without depending each upon something of their own type which came before

Even if you hurt each one of all the powers, it isn't always the case that the mind
is also hurt. But suppose it, the mind, changes because it is hurt by feelings of
grief or the like. It is something we can see then that they--the powers--change
too. Therefore the mind is a very special basis for these powers; and it is
something which depends on the mind itself, meaning former instances of its
same type. Moreover, a number of cases of mental action, or karma, from one's
past life are now the basis for the mind to stay. For these reasons then the mind
is not something which has no basis of its own.

These powers are something then that comes from mind, since they--a number of
previous instances of mind--are the cause that projects the future occurrence of
all the various powers. And later on, things like the mind at the moment of
death too will become the same as these previous cases, crossing the line into
later states of a similar type. This is because the same (meaning the same type
of) projecting ones (that is, causes) are there.

The root text and its commentary just given present different reasonings to
prove the existence of past and future lives. This is because when you prove
that the passing in and out of breath with an infant who has just been born (or
any of the other examples) comes from something of the same type which
occurred previously, one can understand that the "same type" refers to the
inhaling and exhaling of the past life, and so on.

Suppose you say that the powers and so forth of someone who has just now
taken birth could occur only from the various elements. We can see that in
one glass of water there grows one bug with a red head and a yellow body,
and then another with a yellow head and a red body. Some creatures come
out smaller, and others come out larger.

Among humans as well some come with larger bodies, and then some with
smaller ones. Certain people come with a very sharp intellect, and others with
one which is dull. Some children display a great amount of understanding and
love and the like, while others show a tendency towards attachment and other
bad thoughts. According to you, these and similar cases should be impossible,
because beings take birth only through the elements, without having to depend
on any earlier instance of a similar type.

Suppose again that creatures were born only from the elements. Then when
any one element turned into a creature, all the elements would have to turn
into creatures. This is because there would be no cause or condition that
would make one of the two occur, and the other not occur.

Our own position is that a number of instances of mind in the past act as
projecting causes, and from them occur our present powers and so on, which
are such that they result from karma, through a time-lag. And since a number
of instances of mind in the form of the mind at the moment of death will also
provide a cause, for the powers and so forth that come later, we are able to
establish that future lives exist.

For this reason, it is not always the case that the mind is affected when you
hurt any one of the five sense powers. On the other hand, it is invariably the
case that when the mind is affected by strong emotions of grief, or by various
harmful influences, then it does hurt the physical powers. When for example
the mind is affected by powerful feelings of fear, the sense power of the tongue
can no longer taste something as delicious.

One may present the following argument:
What about a case where the power of the eye is damaged, and
because of this the consciousness of the eye loses its ability to see
its object? Isn't it common knowledge that you then undergo
some feelings of distress, and that these affect the mind?

This though is no problem. It is true that such cases are possible, but it is not
that mind is affected by the damage to the sense power. Rather, the damage
to the eye power provides a general condition for a separate occurrence, the
distress. The distress itself increases to a point to where the mind as well is
affected.

It is not though the case that the mind is affected solely by the damage to the
sense power of the eye. This is because there are instances where certain great
beings have given away their very eyes, and yet still felt emotions of great
happiness within their minds.

As such, the mind provides a very unique cause, a sine qua non, for a
corresponding result: the sense powers and so on. The powers and the rest
though do not provide this same kind of cause for any state of mind resulting
from them.

To summarize, let us consider the mind of someone who has just taken birth.
A previous state of mind has come before it, because it (the one at birth) is a
state of mind. It is, for example, like one's current state of mind. This is the
reasoning for proving the existence of former lives.

Consider further the mind at the moment of death, for an ordinary person. It
will cross the line into a later state of mind, because it is a state of mind where
attachment is present. It is, for example, like one's state of mind from the day
before. This is the reasoning for proving existence of future lives.

If one gets caught up in the wording, it might seem that we are asking you to
consider a former state of mind, and arguing that a former state of mind has
preceded it, since it is a state of mind. Or else it sounds like we are saying one
should consider a later state of mind, and arguing that it will cross the line into
a later state of mind, because it is state of mind where attachment is present.
It would seem that we had accepted that all these reasons were true, and that
all the necessities held. And it would seem as though one could never accept
these arguments, for in each case elements were the same.

These proofs are similar to where Master Kamalashila proves past and future
lives in his Concise Commentary on Suchness, for there he states:
A state of mind such that desire is present in it does have the
ability to give birth to yet another state of mind, the one that we
take on at birth. This is because the state of mind at death for an
ordinary person is similar to states of mind on previous occasions
where desire was present: it too has desire.
The text goes on to state that these are types of reasoning where the quality
asserted and the quality accepted share a nature.

With both the reasonings presented above, you would have to perceive past
and future lives if you perceived what the reasonings are trying to prove.
Therefore it will be necessary for us to examine what object we can utilize as
a starting point for perceiving past and future lives.

The Idea of a Material Cause:
The Linchpin for Proving Future Lives
The following selection as well is drawn from Geshe Yeshe Wangchuk's Jewel of the
True Thought.

GSUM PA NYER LEN GYI MTSAN NYID BSHAD PA LA, NYER LEN GYI MTSAN NYID, DE LUS SEMS LA MED PA'O, ,
Here is the third section, where we explain the definition of a material cause.
We proceed in two steps, covering the definition of a material cause, and then
demonstrating that there is no such cause between body and mind.

DANG PO NI, RTZA BAR, NYER LEN 'GYUR BA MED PAR NI, , ZHES PA NAS, 'GYUR BA MED PAR BUM SOGS BZHIN, , ZHES PA'I BAR 'CHAD,
The first of these two is presented by the root text in the lines from "A material
cause could never cause..." up to "...without a change in the clay."

GNYIS PA NI, DNGOS GANG 'GYUR BA MED PAR NI, , ZHES PA NAS, ME DANG ZANGS MA'I KHU NYID BZHIN, , ZHES PA'I BAR 'CHAD DO,
The second is presented in the lines from "Anything that could bring about..."
to "...Exactly like fire and melted copper."

DANG PO NI, NYER LEN 'GYUR BA MED PAR NI, , NYER LEN CAN DAG 'GYUR BAR NI, , BYED PAR MI NUS DPER 'JIM PA, , 'GYUR BA MED PAR BUM SOGS BZHIN, , ZHES PAS,
Here then is the first:
A material cause could never cause
What had it to come about
Unless it were to change itself.
Examples would be a pitcher or such
Without a change in the clay.

NYER LEN ZHES PA DE, NYER LEN NGO BO 'GYUR BA MED PAR NYER LEN CAN TE DE'I 'BRAS BU 'GYUR BA BYED MI NUS PAR DE'I NGO BO TZAM GYI MTHUN MONG MA YIN PA'I LAG RJES DNGOS SU 'JOG BYED YIN PA ZHIG DGOS TE, DPER NA, 'JIM PA 'GYUR BA MED PAR RDZA'I BUM PA SOGS MI 'GYUR BA BZHIN NO, ,
What we call a "material" cause is such that it could never cause "what had it"
(meaning its result) to come about unless the very essence of this material cause
were to undergo a change itself. So what we need for a material cause is
something which, by its very nature, imparts--in a very immediate way--its
own unique affect. Examples would be a ceramic pitcher or such, which could
never occur without a change in the clay.

GNYIS PA DE LUS SEMS LA MED PAR NI, RTZA BAR, DNGOS GANG 'GYUR BA MED PAR NI, , DNGOS PO GANG ZHIG RNAM 'GYUR BA, , DE DE'I NYER LEN MI RIGS TE, , BA GLANG BA MIN LA SOGS BZHIN, , SEMS DANG LUS KYANG DE BZHIN NO, , DE RGYU LHAN CIG BYED PA LAS, , SKYE BA'I 'BRAS BU LHAN CIG GNAS, , ME DANG ZANGS MA'I KHU NYID BZHIN, , ZHES PAS,
Here secondly is the demonstration that there is no such cause between body
and mind. The root text at this point says:
Any thing that could bring about
Any other thing without a change
Could never be its material cause;
It'd be like a buffalo and cow or such,
And the mind and the body
Are just the same.
Here the cause is one together,
With the result that comes from it
The kind that stays together,
Exactly like fire and melted copper.

RGYU'I DNGOS PO GANG 'GYUR BA MED PAR 'BRAS BU'I DNGOS PO GANG ZHIG RNAM PAR 'GYUR BA'I RGYU DE 'BRAS BU DE'I NYER LEN DU MI RIGS TE, DPER NA, BA GLANG DANG BA MIN LA SOGS PA BZHIN NO, , SEMS DANG LUS GNYIS KYANG NYER LEN DANG NYER LEN CAN MA YIN PA DE BZHIN NO, , DE GNYIS KYI NYER LEN PHAN TSUN LHAN CIG BYED RKYEN BYED PA LAS SKYE BA'I PHYIR, DPER NA, ME DANG ZANGS MA'I KHU BA NYID LHAN CIG TU GNAS PA BZHIN NO, , 'DIR BA MIN ZHES PA DE BA GLANG DANG BA 'JO CHEN PO DE LA ZER,
Any particular thing acting as a cause that could bring about any other thing--that
is, its result--without a change could never be its transforming cause; which is to
say, its material cause. It would be, for example, like a buffalo and a cow or any
other such thing.
And the mind and the body are just the same: they could never be for each other
a material cause and the thing that the material cause produced. This is
because they each come from their own material cause, and from each other
only as a factor that is one together with them. They stay, for example,
together--exactly like fire and melted copper.
The unusual Tibetan words here about the cows refer to a buffalo and to a
milk cow.
[The idea being expressed is that, although a buffalo and a cow can interact and affect
each other, and thus in a sense act as factors for certain details of each other's being
as they coexist, they are not the kind of cause and effect for each other where one
transforms into the other; that is, they are not the kind of cause and effect that seeds
and their sprouts are, for example. Fire affects copper by melting it in an apparently
simultaneous way, but does not itself turn into the melted copper.]

Selections on How Ignorant Desire
Triggers Another Life
The first selection is from the Overview of Dependent Origination, by Kedrup
Tenpa Dargye (1493-1568), an eminent author of textbooks from Sera Mey Tibetan
Monastery. The work constitutes ACIP electronic text S0014.

...The definition of that ignorance which constitutes the first of the twelve links
in the chain of dependent origination is: "That view of the perishable
assemblage [view of a "me" or "mine" which has its own nature] which inspires
one to commit fresh cases of the relevant second link--that of immature karma."

...The definition of that immature karma which constitutes the second link in
the chain of dependent origination is: "That impure movement of the mind

ignorance."

This particular immature karma can be divided into three types: merit, non-
meritorious karma, and unshifting karma. Meritorious karma and unshifting
karma are not mutually exclusive, for there does exist something which can be
both basic virtue which is consistent with merit and also the causal form of
balanced concentration.

There are various typical examples of these three. The first would be the
karma which projects as a karmic result the parts of a person who takes birth
in one of the better forms of life in the desire realm. The second would be a
karma which projects as a karmic result the parts of a person who takes birth
in one of the three lives of misery. The third would be a karma which projects
as a karmic result the parts of a person who takes birth in one of the higher
two realms.

This particular craving can be divided into three types: desire craving, fear
craving, and existence craving. Each of these three can be described in the
following typical examples. The first is that craving where you desire not to
be separated from an attractive object. The second is that craving where you
desire to be separated from an unattractive object. The third is that craving
wherein you crave the parts of your being at the time of your death, out of fear
that you think you are going to stop.

SRED PA DE NYID CHER 'PHEL BA'I 'DOD CHAGS, DGU PA LEN PA'I RTEN 'BREL GYI MTSAN NYID,
The definition of that grasping which constitutes the ninth link in the chain of
dependent origination is: "The strong desire that represents the craving of the
previous link developed to an intense degree."

This particular grasping may be divided into four types: grasping to the
desirable, grasping to views, grasping where you profess the existence of a self-
nature, and grasping where you hold mistaken forms of morality and ascetic
practices to be supreme.

The first of these is a kind of desire which is strongly attached to an attractive
object. The second is a kind of desire which is strongly attached to bad views.
The third is a kind of desire which is strongly attached to professing that a
self-nature of a person exists. The fourth is a kind of desire which is strongly
attached to bad ascetic practices.

These two links possess certain typical characteristics. Among the three
categories of being virtuous and so on, they are invariably ethically neutral.
There are types of each which are eliminated by the path of seeing, and types
of each which are eliminated by the path of habituation; both types are
possible. These links are found with both normal beings and with realized
beings, and are had by beings in all three realms.

The definition of that ripened karma which constitutes the tenth link of the
chain of dependent origination is: "The movement of the mind which is in its
essence an impure ripening where karma has become extremely potent due to
its being triggered by the relevant links of craving and grasping."

The second selection is from the Jewel of the True Thought. The verses are inserted
from the original work by Master Dharmakirti, sometimes in shorter excerpts than in
Geshe Wangchuk's text, to facilitate comparison with the corresponding commentary.

Suppose someone makes the following argument: "Let's say that you are right,
and that the view of the perishable assemblage [seeing some "me" or "mine"
with a self-nature] is the very root of the cycle of rebirth. Well then, just after
a person had been able to develop the beginning moments of the path of
seeing, he would have stopped himself from every crossing again the line into
a new rebirth. Why? Because he's free then of the perishable view."

Our answer then would be as follows: "Consider a stream enterer [a person
who has reached the path of seeing, and seen emptiness directly.] Isn't it
rather the case that he has not yet reached a point where, because he has
eliminated the perishable view, he need not take another rebirth? Because isn't
it true that the innate one, the inborn perishable view, is not yet eliminated?
And if it were eliminated, then how could there ever be a rebirth? In that
case then he could of course never take another rebirth."

You could also answer: "Consider then a stream enterer who sees peace in that
same life [that is, who reaches nirvana in the same life in which he reached the
path of seeing]. How could there ever be a rebirth for someone like this? He
is one of those people who is certain to eliminate the perishable view
completely, and thereby achieve nirvana, in the same life that he reaches the
path of seeing.

Therefore it is not the cause for suffering existence." It is not true though that
there exists no innate form of the perishable view. Think of that case where
a person wishes a certain object, where he thinks to himself, "May I be
happy," or "May I never suffer any pain." Without being influenced by any
kind of intellectual belief, he holds to a "me," he thinks of a "me" who is
independent, and who is not just a label applied to the various parts of

We should note at this point that it is incorrect to assert, as some have done,
that the simple awareness of oneself constitutes the perishable view. This is
proven by the fact that enemy destroyers and Buddhas do possess states of
mind in which they think to themselves, "These are my robes," or "This is my
wisdom bowl."

If you disagree that this could ever be the case, then you would have to say as
well that there could never exist that failure in one's monastic vows where you

steal the robes or bowl or any similar article belonging to one of these beings.
This would have to be the case, for these beings would according to you lack
any state of mind where they considered something "mine." A lack of such a
state should always mean that one could not steal from such beings, for the
following distinction is correctly made: So long as the Teacher is still blessing
the world with His presence, there can occur the failure of one's vows where
he steals what rightfully belongs to the Teacher; and yet, after He pretends to
pass into His final nirvana, such a failure can no longer occur.

'JUG PA LAS KYANG 'JIG TSOGS LTA DANG BRAL BA'I SANGS RGYAS KYIS, JI LTAR NGA DANG NGA YI BSTAN PA LTAR, , ZHES GSUNGS PAS SO, ,
There are moreover those lines in Entering [the Middle Way], which talk about
being
Like the case where Buddhas, who are
free of the view
Of the perishable assemblage, still speak of
'me' and 'my teaching'."

From the one cause of being attached to some self-nature,
They conceive of what's not happiness as happiness,
And as a result they dive into everything;
Therefore craving's a basis for rebirth.

   SRED PA CHOS CAN, RKYEN GYI RNAM PA YIN TE, RANG 'BRAS YANG SRID PHYI MA'I LHAN CIG BYED PA'I RTEN YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Consider now craving. It is the [aspect of the truth of the source of suffering
we call] "factor." This is because it is a basis which contributes to a
corresponding result; ie, another rebirth.

It is true that craving is this way, because those who have been brought down
by the tendency to conceive of what's not happiness as being happiness dive
as a result of this into "everything," which refers to unworthy things and
goals. Neither is it true that this totally mistaken backwards conception of
things is without its proper cause, for all this occurs from the one cause of
being attached to some self-nature.

It is true that craving is a cause for a future rebirth, because of the fact that
Masters of the past have said that "Enemy destroyers, those who are free of
attachment, never again see a birth in some future life; this is due to the fact
that they have eliminated craving in its entirety."

On the Four Ancient Schools of Buddhism
The first selection is from the Schools of Philosophy (Grub-mtha'), written by
Changkya Rolpay Dorje (1717-1786) and found at ACIP electronic text numbers
S0060-S0063.

Here next are the Buddhist schools. They are the Detailists, the Sutrists, the
Mind-Only School, and those of the Middle Way. The number of these schools
is exactly four, no more or less, and this is proven by numerous statements
from both the secret and the open scriptures. In particular, in proof of this
number there is the following quotation from the Commentary by Diamond
Heart:
Those of the Buddha are four; the Able One
Had no intention of a fifth.
Master Aryadeva has said as well:

Those who assert that the teachings of the Buddha
Consist of four schools have seen the way it is:
These, for those who hope to practice, are precisely
The paths explained by the Detailists and the rest.

On the question of an evolution of these four schools, some people assert that
the Detailist and Sutrist Schools started after the third council for assembling
the scriptures. They say that the Middle-Way School began during the days
of Master Nagarjuna, and that the Mind-Only started in the time of Arya
Asanga. They also believe that, prior to these points in time, there was no
concept of the four schools.
This idea is however incorrect, for we do see the concept of the four schools
in works such as Ocean of the Angels; the Secret Teaching of Lo Diamond, in Two
Parts; the Secret Teaching of the Wheel of Time; the Secret Teaching of Diamond
Arali; and others as well.

About the Title of the Treasure House
The verses throughout the commentary below are from the Treasure House of
Knowledge (Abhidharmakosha, Chos mngon-pa mdzod,), written by the Master
Vasubandhu around 350 AD and found at ACIP electronic text number T4089. The
commentary to the verses is from Illumination of the Path to Freedom, written by
Gyalwa Gendun Drup, His Holiness the First Dalai Lama (1391-1474) and found at
text number S5525.

*, RGYA GAR SKAD DU, AA BHI DHARMA KO shA K'A RI K'A,
,BOD SKAD DU, CHOS MNGON PA'I MDZOD KYI TSIG LE'UR BYAS PA,
In Sanskrit, the Abhidharmakosha Karika.
In Tibetan, the Chu Ngunpay Dzu Kyi Tsikleur Jepa.
[In English, The Treasure House of Knowledge,
set in verse.]

In Sanskrit, the title of this work is the Abhidharmakosha Karika. In Tibetan,
this translates as Chu Ngunpay Dzu Kyi Tsikleur Jepa [or, in English, The
Treasure House of Knowledge, set in verse.] Abhidharma refers to "knowledge,"
kosha to "treasure house," and karika to "set in verse."

Now why do we bother mentioning the Sanskrit title of this commentary to the
Buddha's words? We want to indicate that the work is of reputable origin.
Buddhas of all three times, whether past or present or future, attain their
enlightenment at the Seat of the Diamond, in India. So the Indian name is
meant to show an origin in the seat of knowledge, India.

A commentary is worth no more or less than it is, but if people think it comes
from India they'll take the time to study and teach it, just because of the better
source. It's just like the local merchants. If they hear some barley has come
from the lowlands, right away they want to trade for it, because the source is
a good one.

A commentary may actually be excellent, but if you don't put some Sanskrit
in it nobody wants to work with it. They think it's just Tibetan. Like local
merchants who heard that some barley came from a highlands nook--nobody
wants to touch it, whether it's really good or bad.

Mentioning the title in Sanskrit has the further purpose of starting a mental
propensity for this excellent tongue. All Buddhas of the three times teach the
Dharma in Sanskrit after their enlightenment. An acquaintance with just this
small amount of the language acts as a mental seed, which will ripen into a
nearly automatic fluency. Finally, it helps one comprehend the differences in
word order between Tibetan and Sanskrit.

Why do we mention the title at the very start? It facilitates locating the proper
volume, and understanding its subject at a glance. Why put the Sanskrit and
Tibetan side by side? So we may recall the kindness of the master translators,
and strive to repay our debt to them.
We'll explain the actual import of the title later on; here first comes the
obeisance of the translator.

actual content of the text only after discussing its structure in three divisions:
a listing of the eight chapters, a demonstration of their interrelation, and a
description of the subject matter presented in each of the eight.

Master Purnavardhana presents the eight chapters of the Treasure House as
follows:
Eight chapters were written to elucidate in detail what is
indicated only briefly by the opening words of the texts: "All
phenomena, stained or without stain." The first two of the
chapters are devoted to a general treatment of stained and
unstained phenomena.

A detailed presentation of stained phenomena is left to the next
three chapters. The third, for example, relates (1) who it is that
is so very afflicted, (2) where they live so very afflicted, and (3)
how they are so very afflicted. It does so with respective
presentations on (1) the five types of beings in the three realms--
the world of living beings; (2) the external world--the "vessel"
which holds these beings, and (3) the four modes of birth and
twelve links of dependent origination. The fourth and fifth
chapters describe what it is that makes beings so very afflicted--
stained deeds and the mental afflictions.

The final three chapters give a detailed treatment of unstained
phenomena. Chapter Six covers who it is, what kind of person,
that is purified; where it is, the place, that he is purified; and how
it is, by what stages of realization, that he is purified. Chapter
Seven concerns what it is that makes the person pure: as sutra
says, "Affliction is something wisdom must destroy." Chapter
Eight concerns meditation--that which provides a base for
wisdom to rely on--for as sutra states again, "The mind in
meditation gleans pure reality."

Other masters of the past have outlined the eight in the following way:
The work is presented in eight chapters in order to address three
points: objects, activity, and result. In general, all objects may be
divided into two types: apparent reality and actual reality. The
first two chapters are devoted to apparent reality; the third,
fourth, and fifth deal with actual reality--the four truths. The
sixth chapter explains the different types of realization, whose
sphere of activity is actual reality. The result which is attained,
wisdom, as well as other personal attributes associated with it are
treated in the final two chapters.

As for the interrelation of these chapters, the first presents the general subject
matter addressed by the works on knowledge: stained and unstained
phenomena. The first chapter makes but a mere mention of the powers and
of the way in which caused phenomena arise; thus the following chapter, the
second, is devoted to a more detailed treatment of these two points. The
subject of the three realms, given only passing mention in these opening
chapters, is therefore explored in the third. Some believe that the three realms

thus presented are creations of some god, such as the one they call "Powerful";
the following, fourth chapter therefore disproves this idea and shows that the
real source is deeds.

The message of the next chapter, the fifth, is that the motivating force behind
the deeds outlined in Chapter Four is the widespread mental afflictions. The
sixth chapter is devoted to demonstrating a path by which we may eliminate
these afflictions, so naturally comes after their presentation. The seventh
chapter provides additional detail about the types of knowledge mentioned in
the sixth; the eighth, lastly, completes the interrelationship of the chapters by
enlarging upon the qualities which the Buddha possesses in common with
advanced beings at lower stages--these qualities and those unique to the
Buddha having first appeared in Chapter Seven.

,GSUM PA NI GZHUNG GI TSIG DON LAS SHES BAR 'GYUR RO,
The third point we have promised, a description of the subject matter
presented in each of the eight chapters, will be understood from the words of
the Master's work itself.

Having thus covered the pledge to compose the work with its preliminary
eulogy, we shall present the actual explanation of the work's title, the first
subject treated once the author has inspired himself for the work. The word
"knowledge" will be explained first, both by itself and, incidentally, with regard
to its accessories. Then we will speak of the expression "treasure house."

,CHOS MNGON SHES RAB DRI MED RJES 'BRANG BCAS,
Knowledge is unstained wisdom, and its accessories.
[I.5]

,DANG PO NI, CHOS MNGON MDZOD KYI BSTAN BCOS RAB BSHAD BYA, ZHES BSHAD NA, CHOS MNGON PA DE GANG ZHE NA, 'DI LA GNYIS YOD PA LAS 
Master Vasubandhu has promised "To write this commentary, the Treasure
House of Knowledge." But what does he mean by "knowledge"? There are two
types of such knowledge; we may describe the first in the form of a logical
statement:

ZAG MED KYI MTHONG SGOM MI SLOB LAM GSUM PO CHOS CAN, DON DAM PA'I CHOS MNGON PA YIN TE, DRI MA MED PA'I SHES RAB RJES 'BRANG DANG BCAS PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Consider the following three paths without stain: those of seeing,
habituation, and no further learning.
They are actual knowledge, because
They constitute unstained wisdom and its accessories.

GNYIS PA LA GNYIS, DON DAM PA'I CHOS MNGON PA'I RJES 'BRANG DANG , BRDAR BTAGS PA'I CHOS MNGON PA'I RJES 'BRANG GI DON LA DPYAD PA'O, , DANG PO LA GSUM, SA GANG LA BRTEN PA, RTEN BRTEN PA'I DON, 'KHOR DANG BCAS NA PHUNG PO DU BA YIN DPYAD PA'O,
Now the second portion of knowledge, its accessories, may further be
addressed in two divisions of real accessories to knowledge and merely
nominal accessories to knowledge. Real accessories to knowledge may be

considered in terms of the level upon which they rely, the meaning of reliance
in the present context, and an investigation into how many heaps knowledge
has, if you also count all which stand in attendance to it.

,DANG PO NI, 'O NA DE GSUM SA GANG LA BRTAN CE NA, MTHONG LAM NI BSAM GTAN SA DRUG GANG RUNG LA BRTEN PA YIN TE, SBYOR LAM CHOS MCHOG BSAM GTAN SA DRUG GANG RUNG LA BRTEN PA GANG ZHIG, MTHONG LAM DE CHOS MCHOG DANG SA GCIG PA'I PHYIR TE, DE NI CHOS MCHOG DANG SA GCIG, CES GSUNGS SO, , RTAGS DANG PO GRUB STE, SGOM BYUNG MI LCOGS MED PA DANG , KHYAD PAR BSAM GTAN SA PA'O, , ZHES GSUNGS,
On what levels do the three mentioned paths rely? The path of seeing may
rely on any of the six levels of concentration. This is because the final stage
of the path of preparation, known as "ultimate phenomenon," may itself rely
upon any of these six levels; and the path of seeing always relies upon the
same level as the stage of the ultimate phenomenon. As the scripture states,
"Same level as ultimate phenomenon." Scripture also confirms our assertion
that the ultimate-phenomenon stage can rely on any of the six levels:
Meditative at beyond no leisure,
Extraordinary concentration level too.

Nominal Accessories to Knowledge

,DE THOB BYA PHYIR GANG DANG BSTAN BCOS GANG ,
Those used to achieve it, and the commentaries.
[I.6]

YIN PA DANG , DE RNAMS BRJOD BYAR BYED PA'I BSTAN BCOS YE SHES LA 'JUG PA LA SOGS PA NI BRDAR BTAGS PA'I CHOS MNGON PA YIN NO,
There are a number of accessories to knowledge which are merely nominal.
Those include first the wisdoms of learning, contemplation, and meditation,
which are practiced in order "to achieve it"--actual knowledge. Second there
is that amount of wisdom with which one is born. Finally there are the
classical commentaries which take these very types of wisdom as their subject
matter. These include The Practice of Wisdom and similar works.

,DE RNAMS CHOS CAN, KHYOD LA CHOS MNGON PA'I MING GIS 'DOGS PA'I RGYU MTSAN YOD DE, KHYOD DON DAM PA'I CHOS MNGON PA THOB PA'I THABS SAM RGYU YIN PA'I PHYIR, DE YANG RGYUR 'GYUR TSUL NI SKYES THOB KYI SHES RAB LA BRTEN NAS, THOS BYUNG , DE LAS BSAM BYUNG , DE LAS SGOM BYUNG , DE LAS ZAG MED KYI SHES RAB SKYE BA'I PHYIR,
Let us use the form of a logical statement:
Consider the accessories to knowledge just mentioned.
They may be given the name "knowledge," because
They constitute the means or cause of one's achieving actual knowledge.
 BTAGS PA LA DGOS PA YOD DE, DON DAM PA'I CHOS MNGON PA THOB PA LA KHYOD THABS SAM RGYUR BSTEN DGOS SO ZHES GO BA'I CHED YIN PA'I PHYIR, DNGOS LA GNOD BYED YOD DE, ZAG BCAS YIN PA'I PHYIR,
What is the actual process of causation here? Untainted wisdom springs from
meditative wisdom, which comes from contemplative wisdom, which derives
from the wisdom of learning--all dependent upon the wisdom with which one
was born.
Calling these accessories "knowledge" serves a specific purpose: the author is
trying to tell us that they must be relied upon as methods, or causes, for
achieving real knowledge. In actual point of fact they could never be
knowledge, since they are stained.

The Meaning of the Name of the Book

Where does the word "knowledge" [Sanskrit: abhidharma] come from? A
phenomenon [dharma] is that which possesses [dhr¸] a nature. And knowledge
brings to [abhi] you, or leads you to [abhi] that highest of all existing
phenomena: nirvana.

,'DIR DE DON DU YANG DAG CHUD PHYIR RAM,
,'DI YI GNAS DE YIN PAS CHOS MNGON MDZOD,
"Treasure house" of knowledge because they all fit here
In its points, or since they are its home.

Master Vasubandhu has stated: "I shall write this commentary, The Treasure
House of Knowledge." Just how is it a treasure house of knowledge? The very
most prized points of the Seven Works on Knowledge all fit here in the
points, in the subject matter, of the Master's commentary. The scabbard in
which you sheathe a sword, for example, is called the "scabbard of the sword,"
and the place where you deposit your riches is termed the "treasure house of
riches."

,YANG NA NI MNGON BA SDE BDUN PO DE LA MNGON PA'I MDZOD CES BYA STE, DE BSTAN BCOS 'DI'I 'BYUNG KHUNGS SAM GNAS YIN PA'I PHYIR, DPER NA, RAL GRI GANG NAS PHYUNG BA DE LA RAL GRI'I SHUBS ZHES BRJOD PA BZHIN NO,
You could also say that the Seven works on Knowledge are themselves the
"treasure house," and that they are the home, or source, for the present work.
The expression "scabbard of the sword," for example, can just as well indicate
the place from where the sword was drawn.

Next comes a demonstration that the teachings on knowledge are the word of
the Teacher, preceded by a statement of purpose.

There's no way to put the mental afflictions
to rest without an
Ultimate analysis of every existing
phenomenon, and this
Affliction is what keeps the world adrift
here in the ocean of
Life. Thus the Teacher has spoken it, they say.
[I.9-12]

Giving an explanation of knowledge has the following purpose. Without
wisdom which analyzes every phenomenon in an ultimate way, there is no
way of putting to rest all that the mental afflictions imply. And this
affliction is what keeps those of the world adrift here in the ocean of life.
It is therefore necessary to plant, in students' minds, wisdom which can make
this ultimate analysis of phenomena. Thus the explanation.

The Meaning of the Name of the Abhidharma School

"Now why is the other school," one might continue, "known as the `Detailists'?"
One may say that they are "Detailists" because they devote their study
exclusively to the classical commentary known as Detailed Exposition, or else
because they understand the Exposition's meaning. The school itself may be
further divided into a number of groups. Those who reside in Kashmir are
known as the "Kashmiris," while those who live in the western part of the
same land are known as the "Westerners." Detailists in areas other than
Kashmir, those in central India and so forth, are referred to collectively as those
"Under the Sun."

Now the lines beginning with "There's no way to put the mental afflictions to
rest..." also indicate that Master Vasubandhu's commentary possesses the four
requisite attributes of a reputable work. Again we may use the form of a
logical statement:
Consider the act of making a statement of purpose, and of a relation of
the text to that purpose, here at the beginning of the commentary.
It has a purpose of its own, because
It conveys to disciples the fact that the commentary possesses the four
attributes of a reputable work. Once they realize that these attributes are
present, disciples will be inspired to study the text.

Here are the four attributes:
1) The subject matter of the text concerns stained and unstained types of
phenomena. It is indicated in the verse with the words "every existing
phenomenon."
2) The purpose is to utilize this subject matter to plant, in students' minds,
that wisdom which analyzes phenomena in an ultimate way. It is
indicated by the words "ultimate analysis."
3) The ultimate goal is to have these students achieve nirvana, both with
and without anything remaining. It is indicated indirectly by the entire
phrase running from "There's no way..." up to "...without," and on from
"this affliction..." up to the word "Thus."
4) A relation exists in that the purpose must be achieved through the
subject matter of the work, and the ultimate goal through this very
purpose.
One may also state the relation as being between the subject matter of the
work (that is, all existing phenomena) and the means by which this subject
matter is expressed (i.e., the commentary itself).

What Causes Worlds

,LAS LAS 'JIG RTEN SNA TSOGS SKYES,
Deeds cause the multitude of worlds.
[IX.1]

GONG DU BSHAD PA'I SNOD BCUD KYI 'JIG RTEN SNA TSOGS PA 'DI GANG LAS BYUNG ZHE NA, RGYU MED DANG MI MTHUN PA'I RGYU LAS BYUNG BA MA YIN TE, RES 'GA' SKYE BA DANG , DBANG PHYUG SOGS MIN RIM SOGS PHYIR, , ZHES BSHAD PA'I PHYIR,
One may begin with the following question: "You have just described a
multitude of worlds--both the great vessels of the outer worlds and the living
beings they contain. Where do they all come from?" They do not come from
no cause at all, and they do not come from causes that are inconsistent with
their own nature. This is because they stay for some time, then go away; and
as the root text said itself, "Not an almighty one or the like, because of stages
and such."

'O NA GANG LAS SKYES ZHE NA, LAS LAS SNOD BCUD KYI 'JIG RTEN SNA TSOGS PA SKYES SO,
What then does cause them? It is the past deeds of living beings that cause all
the multitude of worlds--both the places and the people.

,GNYIS PA LA, LAS KYI NGO BO, MDO LAS 'BYUNG BA'I MING GI RNAM GRANGS SO, , DANG PO LA, BSTAN, BSHAD DO, DANG PO NI,
The exposition that follows now on deeds is divided into two parts: first on the
basic nature of deeds, and secondly on listings from sutra on the different
types of deeds. The former is itself presented first in a brief introduction and
then in a more detailed treatment.
11
Introduction to Deeds

,DE NI SEMS PA DANG DES BYAS,
,SEMS PA YID KYI LAS YIN NO,
,DES BSKYED LUS DANG NGAG GI LAS,
,DE DAG RNAM RIG RNAM RIG MIN,
They're movement of the mind and what it brings.
Mental movement is a deed of thought;
What it causes, deeds of body and speech.
These are either communicating or not.
[IV.2-5]

LAS LAS 'JIG RTEN SNA TSOGS SKYES, ZHES BSHAD NA, LAS DE LA DBYE NA DU ZHE NA, LAS DE NI GNYIS SU YOD DE, SEMS PA'I LAS DANG , SEMS PA DES BYAS PA'I BSAM PA'I LAS GNYIS SU YOD PA'I PHYIR,
"In the line above," one might continue, "you said that `deeds cause the
multitude of worlds.' Just how many types of deeds are there?" They--deeds--
are of two different types: deeds consisting of movement of the mind, and the
deeds that it brings--those that the mind motivates.

DE DAG GI NGO BO GANG ZHE NA, SEMS PA NI YID KYI LAS YIN TE, YID KYI RNAM PAR SHES PA DANG MTSUNGS LDAN GYI LAS YIN PA'I PHYIR, SEMS PA DES BSKYED PA'I BSAM PA'I LAS LA LUS KYI LAS DANG , NGAG GI LAS GNYIS, DE DAG LA'ANG RNAM PAR RIG BYED DANG RNAM PAR RIG BYED MA YIN PA GNYIS GNYIS YOD DO,
One may ask about each of their basic natures. Mental movement is a deed
of the thought, for it consists of a deed linked with consciousness of the
thought. What it causes--that is, deeds motivated by the mind--are of two
kinds: these are deeds of the body and deeds of speech. These two
themselves can be further divided into two types each: they are either what we
call "communicating" or not.

,GNYIS PA LA, LAS KYI RANG BZHIN, LAS GSUM SPYI'I CHOS KYI KHYAD PAR, RNAM PAR RIG BYED MA YIN PA'I DBYE BA'O,
Our more detailed treatment of these points continues in three steps: the
definition of a deed, typical features of the three types of deeds in general, and
different divisions of non-communicating types of deeds.

,DANG PO LA, RNAM PAR RIG BYED DANG , RNAM PAR RIG BYED MA YIN PA'O, , DANG PO LA, LUS KYI RNAM PAR RIG BYED DANG , NGAG GI RNAM PAR RIG BYED DO,
In discussing the definition of a deed we will cover first the communicating,
and then the non-communicating types. The former will be described first for
those of the body, and then for those of speech.

12
Communicating Deeds of the Body

,LUS RNAM RIG BYED DBYIBS SU 'DOD,
Body communicating held to be shape.
[IV.6]

,DANG PO NI, DE DAG RNAM RIG RNAM RIG MIN, ZHES BSHAD NA, LUS KYI RNAM PAR RIG BYED KYI LAS DE GANG ZHE NA, BYE BRAG SMRA BA NA RE, LUS KYI RNAM PAR RIG BYED NI, PHYAG 'TSAL BA DANG SROG GCOD PA LA SOGS PA'I GNAS SKABS KYI BYA BA LA GNAS PA'I SEMS PAS KUN NAS BSLANGS PA'I LUS KYI DBYIBS SU 'DOD DO,
"You mentioned," one might start, "a line just now saying `these are either
communicating or not.' Can you describe the types of bodily deeds that are
said to be `communicating'?" Communicating deeds of the body are held in
the present school to be the shape that the physical body takes under
motivation by movements of the mind present for the duration of specific
actions such as prostrating oneself before a holy object or taking the life of a
sentient being.
13
Non-Communicating Form

,G-YENGS DANG SEMS MED PA YI YANG ,
,DGE DANG MI DGE RJES 'BREL GANG ,
,'BYUNG BA CHE RNAMS RGYUR BYAS PA,
,DE NI RNAM RIG BYED MIN BRJOD,
Even during distraction, while mind is stopped,
Virtue or not, continuing after,
Taking the great elements as its causes,
This form we say does not communicate.
[I.41-4]

,GSUM PA RNAM PAR RIG BYED MA YIN PA'I GZUGS BSHAD PA NI, RNAM RIG BYED MIN ZHES BSHAD NA, RNAM PAR RIG BYED MA YIN PA'I GZUGS DE GANG ZHE NA,
Someone may begin:
What about the line above that ends with the words "...and non-
communicating"? What do you mean by "non-communicating
form"?

DE NI KHYAD PAR LNGA DANG LDAN PA YIN TE, GNAS SKABS KYI KHYAD PAR SEMS G-YENGS PA DANG , SEMS MED PA'I SNYOMS 'JUG GNYIS KYI GNAS SKABS NA YANG YOD PA DANG ,
This form which does not communicate possesses five distinctive features.
The first is a feature of period: this type of form is present even during periods
when one is distracted, or while one is engaged in a controlled meditation
where mind is stopped.

DE TZAM ZHIG MIG LA SOGS PA LA YANG YOD PAS NGO BO'I KHYAD PAR DGE BA DANG MI DGE BA GANG RUNG YIN PA, , DE TZAM ZHIG RNAM PAR RIG BYED LA YANG YOD PAS DUS KYI KHYAD PAR RGYUN MCHOG TU RJES SU 'BREL BA, DE TZAM ZHIG DGE MI DGE'I THOB PA LA YANG YOD PAS 'BYUNG BA CHEN PO BZHE RNAMS RGYUR BYAS PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
This much is also true of the eye and so on, so that we must mention a feature
of essence: this form is either virtuous or not. The description so far could
apply to communicating form as well, so a feature of time is included: non-
communicating form continues on after a deed, in a perfect stream. As much
could also be said of virtuous and non-virtuous holds, and thus we note that
this form takes the great elements as its causes.

DE LA KHA CHE 'DUN BZANG NA RE, 'DI LA MA TSANG BSTAN BCOS 'GAL, NYAMS DANG DE MIN DE NYID THAL, , YANG SGRA LHAG BRJOD KHYAD PAR DU, , BYA BA KHYAD PAR MA BYAS SO, , ZHES MTSAN NYID DE SUN 'BYIN TE,
The Kashmiri Sanghabhadra [?] attacks this definition with the following verse:
It's incomplete, contradicts classical
Commentary, one then is not,
One not then is. "Even's" superfluous,
A feature not mentioned should be.

RNAM PAR RIG BYED MA YIN PA'I GZUGS SKAD CIG DANG PO CHOS CAN, RNAM PAR RIG BYED MA YIN PA'I GZUGS MIN PAR THAL, RGYUN MCHOG TU RJES SU 'BREL BA MA TSANG PA'I PHYIR, DE CHOS CAN, RDZAS YOD MIN PAR THAL, RGYUN YIN PA'I PHYIR, 'DOD NA, BSTAN BCOS LAS RDZAS YOD DU BSHAD PA DANG 'GAL,
He explains his criticism as follows:
Let's consider some non-communicating form at the first instant
of its existence. According to you, it could never be non-
communicating form, because it is incomplete--it lacks the feature
of continuing on in a perfect stream. Consider this form again.
According to you, it could also never be a substantial thing,
because it's a stream. And if you go ahead and agree that it is
not substantial, you contradict the classical commentaries which
explain that it is.

YANG TING NGE 'DZIN LAS SKYES PA'I RNAM PAR RIG BYED MA YIN PA'I YI GZUGS CHOS CAN, RNAM PAR RIG BYED MA YIN PA'I GZUGS YIN PA NYAMS PAR THAL, G-YENGS PA DANG SEMS MED PA'I GNAS SKABS NA MED PA'I PHYIR TE, MA G-YENGS PA DANG SEMS DANG BCAS PA'I GNAS SKABS NA YO DANG SA SO, ,
Consider further the non-communicating form that is created by
single-pointed concentration. If your definition is correct, then it
is not non-communicating form. This is because it does not exist
during particular periods when one is distracted, or while mind
is stopped; rather, it is present during periods when one is not
distracted, and when the mind is functioning.

RNAMS PAR RIG BYED MIN PA'I GZUGS DE MIN PA RNAM PAR RIG BYED KYI GZUGS CHOS CAN, RNAM PAR RIG BYED MA YIN PA'I GZUGS SU THAL, MA G-YENGS PA DANG SEMS DANG BCAS PA'I GNAS SKABS NA YOD PA'I PHYIR, YANG SGRA LHAG STE,  SEMS G-YENGS PA'I GNAS SKABS NA YOD PAR BSHAD PAS SEMS DANG BCAS PA'I GNAS SKABS NA YOD PAR GO NUS PA'I PHYIR, BSTAN DU MED CING THOGS PA MED PA'I GZUGS ZHES PA'I KHYAD PAR BYA DGOS PA MA BYAS PA'I SKYON YANG YOD CES BRJOD NAS,
Take too what is not this kind of form at all: form which does
communicate intent. If you are right then it is form which doesn't
communicate intent, because it is present during periods without
distraction, and with a functioning mind. Moreover, the word
"even" is superfluous: when you state that this type of form is
there when the mind is distracted, everyone understands that it
is also present at times when the mind is functioning. You have,
finally, also made the mistake of not mentioning a feature which
should have been: the fact that this type of form is invisible and
ineffable.

'DUN BZANG RANG GI LUGS LA, BYAS PA DANG YANG MI 'DRA BA'I, , SEMS PA'ANG SEMS MED PA LA GANG , , LUNG BSTAN THOGS PA MED PA RIG GZUGS, , DE NI RNAM RIG BYED MIN BRJOD, , CES DE'I MTSAN NYID 'JOG PAR BYED DO,
Sanghabhadra [?] then presents an alternative definition, in the following verse
of his own:
Form different from the one
You made: during thought and also
Not, specified, ineffable,
This does "not communicate."

,LUGS GNYIS KA LTAR NA'ANG MA G-YENGS SEMS BCAS KYI RJES SU BYED PAS DER 'DOD NA, RIG BYED KYANG DER THAL BA DANG , SEMS MED KYI RJES SU BYED PAS DER 
'DOD NA TING NGE 'DZIN LAS SKYES PA'I SDOM PA GNYIS DE MIN PAR THAL BA'I NYES PA SO NA GNAS SO, ,
Both of the above systems, nonetheless, amount to the same inconsistency. If
you establish something as non-communicating form because it relates to
periods when the mind is not distracted, or functioning, then form which does
communicate intent must also not communicate it. And if on the other hand
you establish something as non-communicating because it relates to periods
where the mind is stopped, then the two restraints which arise from single-
pointed concentration could never be non-communicating.

In the ethically neutral, those described.
[IV.30b-6]

One may ask whether virtue and the rest are established only on the basis of
the motivation involved. They are not; in fact, there are four different
divisions, beginning with what we call "ultimate" virtue. How do we describe
them?

THAR PA CHOS CAN, DAM PA'I DON DU DGE BA YIN TE, SDUG BSNGAL MA LUS PA DANG BRAL BAS MCHOG TU BDE BA'I PHYIR, DPER NA, SKYES BU RANG BZHIN GYIS NAD MED PA BZHIN, DGE BA'I RTZA BA GSUM DANG NGO TSA SHES PA DANG KHREL YOD CHOS CAN, NGO BO NYID KYIS DGE BA YIN TE, GZHAN LA MA LTOS PAR BDAG NYID KYIS DGE BA YIN PA'I PHYIR, DPER NA, 'PHROD PA'I SMAN BZHIN,
First consider freedom--nirvana. It is the ultimate virtue, for it is the highest
state of happiness, free of every single suffering. It's like a totally healthy
person. Next consider the three roots of virtue, as well as a sense of shame
and a conscience. They are virtue by nature, for they are virtue in and of
themselves, without relying on anything else. They are like medicinal herbs.
 DE DAG DANG MTSUNGS PAR LDAN PA'I SEMS SEMS BYUNG RNAMS CHOS CAN, MTSUNGS LDAN GYIS DGE BA YIN TE, MTSUNGS LDAN DGE BAS DGE BAR BZHAG PA'I PHYIR, DPER NA, 'PHROD PA'I SMAN DANG SBYAR BA'I BTUNG BA BZHIN,
Still further let us take those instances of mind and mental functions that are
joined in a mental link with them--with these virtues. They are "mental-link"
virtue, for we establish them as virtue by the fact that they share a mental link
with virtue. They are, for example, like the liquid in which you mix your
medicinal herbs.

DE DAG GIS KUN NAS BSLANGS PA'I LUS NGAG GI BYA BA LA SOGS PA CHOS CAN, KUN SLONG GIS DGE BA YIN TE, KUN SLONG DGE BAS DGE BAR BZHAG PA'I PHYIR, DPER NA, 'PHROD PA'I SMAN DANG SBYAR BA'I BTUNG BA LAS BYUNG BA'I 'O MA BZHIN,
Next consider physical and verbal actions and the like--the things that are
motivated by the mental elements just described. They are what we call
"motivational" virtue, for they are considered virtue by reason of the virtuous
motivation involved with them. We can compare them to the milk that a
mother produces after she has drunk the liquid mixed with the medicinal herbs
described.

DE DAG LAS BZLOG PA MI DGE BA YIN NO, , JI LTAR NA, 'KHOR BA CHOS CAN, DON DAM PAR MI DGE BA YIN TE, SDUG BSNGAL GYIS BCINGS PAS MCHOG TU MI BDE BA'I PHYIR, NAD BZHIN,
The opposites of each of the above are what we call "non-virtue"; the process
is as follows. First take the cycle of life. It is the ultimate non-virtue, for it is
the highest form of unhappiness--total bondage in suffering. It is like an
illness.

MI DGE BA'I RTZA BA GSUM DANG NGO TSA MED PA DANG KHREL MED CHOS CAN, NGO BO NYID KYIS MI DGE BA YIN TE, GZHAN LA MA LTOS PAR BDAG NYID KYIS MI DGE BA YIN PA'I PHYIR, MI 'PHROD PA'I SMAN BZHIN,
Next consider the three root non-virtues, as well as shamelessness and the lack
of a conscience. They are non-virtue by nature, for they are non-virtue in and
of themselves, without relying on anything else. They are like poisonous
herbs.

Then consider instances of mind and mental functions which share a mental
link with these non-virtues. They are "mental-link" non-virtue, for we establish
them as non-virtue because they share a mental link with non-virtue. These
we can compare to a liquid in which the poisonous herbs were mixed.

Let's next take the deeds of body and speech motivated by the mental elements
described. These are "motivational" non-virtue, for we establish them as non-
virtue through the non-virtuous motivation involved. These types resemble the
milk that a mother gives after she has drunk the liquid mixed with the
poisonous herbs.

,DON DAM PAR LUNG DU MA BSTAN PA NI, SNGAR BSTAN PA'I SO SOR BRTAGS MIN GYI 'GOG PA DANG , 'DUS MA BYAS KYI NAM MKHA' DAG YIN NO, , GNYIS PA NI,
The ultimate in the things which are ethically neutral consist of those
instances we have described previously: non-analytic cessations and
unproduced space.

The Definition of the Three Types of Karma
The following brief definition of the three types of karma is found in the Treasure
House of Chim, a commentary upon the Treasure House of Wisdom by Chim
Jampeyang (c. 1280) found at S6954.

MDO LAS LAS DGE MI DGE LUNG MA BSTAN GSUM GSUNGS PA LAS DUS RE ZHIG LAS KYI RNAM SMIN YID DU 'ONG BA BDE BA MYONG BA DANG GTAN DU SDUG BSNGAL LAS SKYOB PA MYANG 'DAS THOB BYED NI DGE BA DANG , RNAM SMIN YID DU MI 'ONG BA MI BDE BA MYONG BA NI MI 
DGE BA DANG , YID DU 'ONG MI 'ONG SKYED PA DE GNYIS LAS GZHAN PA'I LAS NI DGE MI DGE LAS GZHAN PA LUNG MA BSTAN YIN NO,
Sutra describes three kinds of karma: virtuous karma, non-
virtuous karma, and neutral karma. Virtue is that karma which,
in the short term, brings you a karmic ripening which is desirable
(that is, a feeling of pleasure), and ultimately protects you from
suffering (that is, helps you achieve nirvana). Non-virtue is that
karma which brings you a karmic ripening which is undesirable
(that is, a feeling of pain). A neutral deed, something neither
virtuous nor non-virtuous, is that karma which brings you
something which is neither desirable nor undesirable.
We return next to the commentary of His Holiness the First Dalai Lama:
16
Deeds according to Result

,BSOD NAMS BSOD NAMS MIN MI G-YO,
,BDE BA MYONG 'GYUR LA SOGS GSUM,
Merit, non-merit, those which are unshifting;
The three including those which lead to pleasure.
[IV.179-80]

,DANG PO NI, LAS DE LA GSUM YOD DE, BSOD NAMS KYI LAS DANG , BSOD NAMS MA YIN PA'I LAS DANG , MI G-YO BA'I LAS RNAMS SU YOD PA'I PHYIR, YANG LAS DE LA GSUM YOD DE, BDE BA MYONG BAR 'GYUR BA'I LAS LA SOGS PA GSUM YOD PA'I PHYIR, GNYIS PA LA, BSOD NAMS SOGS BSHAD PA DANG , BDE SOGS BSHAD PA'O, , DANG PO NI,
Now deeds may be divided into three different types: deeds which represent
merit, non-merit, or those which are unshifting. They can also be divided
into a different set of three: the three including those which lead to an
experience of pleasure and so on.

Our more detailed treatment of these points will proceed in two steps: first a
presentation of merit and the rest; secondly, a description of the mentioned
pleasure and so on.
17
Merit, Non-Merit, and Unshifting Deeds

,BSOD NAMS 'DOD KHAMS DGE BA'I LAS,
,MI G-YO GONG MA LAS SKYES PA'I,
,GANG PHYIR SA NI DE DAG TU,
,LAS RNAMS SMIN PHYIR MI G-YO'I PHYIR,
Merit, virtuous deeds of the realm of desire.
The ones that come from the above, unshifting.
They're unshifting for the reason that
The deeds involved ripen at their levels.
[IV.181-4]

'O NA, BSOD NAMS KYI LAS LA SOGS PA GANG ZHE NA, BSOD NAMS KYI LAS NI 'DOD KHAMS KYI DGE BA'I LAS DANG , MI G-YO BA'I LAS NI GONG MA GZUGS GZUGS MED LAS SKYES PA'I LAS YIN NO,
One might start with the following question: "Just how do you describe merit
and the other types of deeds you mentioned?" Deeds that we call "merit" are
the virtuous deeds of the realm of desire. What we call "unshifting" deeds
are the ones that come from those realms above; that is, from the form and
formless realms.

,GONG MA'I LAS DE MI G-YO BA YIN NA, BSAM GTAN GSUM PA MAN CHAD G-YO PAR BSHAD PA DANG 'GAL ZHE NA, MI 'GAL TE, BSAM GTAN GSUM PA MAN CHAD G-YO 
BAR BSHAD PA NI TING NGE 'DZIN GYI SKYON GYIS G-YO BA LA DGONGS, GONG MA'I LAS RNAM SMIN MI G-YO BA LA DGONGS PA'I PHYIR,
"Isn't it contradictory," one may object, "for you to describe deeds of the upper
realms as unshifting, when those of the third and lower levels of concentration
are explained as shifting types?" There is no contradiction. The levels of
concentration from the third on down are explained as "shifting" or "affected"
only with reference to their being affected by the various problems that prevent
one from perfecting single-pointed concentration. The point in calling deeds
of the upper realms "unshifting" is in reference, rather, to the fact that they do
not shift direction when they ripen.

RNAM SMIN MI G-YO BA YIN TE, GANG GI PHYIR NA GZUGS GZUGS MED KYIS NI DE DAG TU SMIN PAR 'GYUR PA'I LAS KYI RNAM SMIN SA GZHAN DU NAM YANG MI SMIN PA'I PHYIR NA RNAM SMIN GZHAN DU MI G-YO BA'I PHYIR,
These deeds are called "unshifting" for the reason that a ripening of deeds
which is meant to occur at "their" level--at the levels of the form and formless
realms--will never occur at any other level. The point is thus that the ripening
is an unshifting one.

Deeds of the desire realm, on the other hand, are shifting--someone meant to
be born as a pleasure being can, through the effect of certain factors, take birth
as one of the other types of beings. There was for example the case of the
Brahmin who because of his generosity was to be born as a pleasure being.
But he caught sight of an especially majestic elephant and thought to himself
how wonderful it would be if he could obtain one. As a result, he took birth
as the elephant known as Son of the Protector.

Next we consider deeds involving a sensation of pleasure and so on. We
proceed in three steps concerning (1) definitive examples of each of the deeds
leading to specific types of experiences, (2) the various divisions of experience,
and (3) the correlation between specific sensations and the deeds they result
from. Definitive examples are discussed in terms of both positions accepted
by the present school and those accepted by others.

These are either definite or not;
The definite's three types because of those
Experienced as something seen and such.
Some claim that the kinds of deeds are five,
Others that the combinations are four.
Three of them act to project a discrete being.

Now there are three types of deeds which lead to a future experience through
a process of ripening. These types of deeds themselves are grouped into two:
they are either definite, or not. The "definite" group is of three different
types, because it includes (1) those deeds with results that are experienced as
"something seen"--that is, deeds which ripen into an experience in this very
life; (2) deeds with results that are experienced after one's rebirth--that is, in the
very next life; and (3) deeds with results that are experienced in "some other"
life--which is to say, in any life after the next.

KHA CIG LAS RNAM PA LNGA ZHES ZER TE, MA NGES PA'I LAS LA RNAM SMIN NGES LA GNAS SKABS MA NGES PA DANG , DE GNYIS KA MA NGES PA GNYIS SU PHYE BAS SO,
Some people claim that the kinds of deeds are five: they arrive at this figure
by dividing indefinite types of deeds into (1) those which will definitely ripen
but at an indefinite time, and (2) those where neither ripening itself nor its
timing is definite.

Others--namely, the Exemplist group in the Sutrist school--claim that the
possible combinations which hold true in this regard are four. They say there
are (1) deeds which are definite to ripen but at no definite time, (2) deeds
which should ripen at a definite time but which are not definite to ripen at all,
(3) deeds which are definite in both respects, and (4) deeds which are definite
in neither respect.

One may ask which of these deeds projects a discrete being in the future.
Three of them act to project a discrete being, but deeds with results that you
see in this very life do not. This is because they ripen upon the very same
stream of heaps which performed the original deed.
Next we examine the number of different deeds that can be projected with
different realms and types of beings.

Those are definite which involve fierce

"Just what," one may ask, "do you mean when you mention types of deeds that
are certain to ripen?" Those deeds are definite (will definitely ripen into a
future experience) which involve any of the following:
1) fierce emotions, of either mental affliction or faith;
2) an object of special qualities--that is, deeds performed with respect
to the Gems;
3) anything done on a continual basis; and
4) killing one's father or mother, even when this is done with
meritorious intent.

,DE NI MTHONG CHOS 'BRAS BU YIN, , ZHES BSHAD NA DE GANG ZHE NA, MTHONG CHOS 'BRAS BU CAN GYI LAS ZHING DANG BSAM BA'I KHYAD PAR LAS 'GYUR PA YIN TE,
"In the lines above," one may continue, "you mentioned that `one is the type
with results that you see.' Can you describe this further?" Deeds with results
which are something seen in the same life are this way due to special features
of the object or thought involved.

A case of a deed which, because of the special features of the object involved,
turned into the type that gives a result in the very same life would be as
follows. In one of his former lives, our Teacher was once a certain monk who
had mastered all three sections of the canon. There had been a steady increase
in quarreling among the community of monks. One monk--who had himself
committed the sections of the canon to memory--managed to bring the different
sides to an agreement. This angered the other monk (the one who was a
master of the canon), who made the sarcastic statement that "A woman has
settled a women's quarrel." Because of this deed the monk turned into a
woman in that very life, and took five hundred births thereafter as a woman
as well.

An instance of a deed which, because of special features of the thought
involved, turns into the type that gives a result that you see in this very life
would be as follows. King Kanaka had a certain eunuch by the name of
"Longwa." He met someone driving a herd of five hundred cattle and asked
the man what he planned to do. "We're going to castrate them," was the reply.
Overcome with compassion, Longwa managed to save all the cattle from their
fate: as a result, his own organ was restored in the very same life.

Aside from the above, anything which was something certain to ripen at any
particular level can also constitute a deed which gives a result that you see in
the very same life, in cases where the person has become completely free of
any desire for this level.

Help or harm to any of the following
Leads to quick experience of a result:
Anyone coming out of cessation or love,
No affliction, seeing, result of destroying.
[IV.221-4]

One may ask about the features that make an object special. Help or harm
which you perform towards anyone who has just come out of cessation leads
to a quick experience of a result, for it is almost as if such a person has just
come back from nirvana. Help and harm too towards anyone who has just
come out of a meditation on immeasurable love or a state of one-pointed
concentration where he has no affliction at all also leads to the speedy
experience of a result. This is because such persons are helping every living
being; they are involved with a willingness to accept the ultimate personal
responsibility, free of any affliction; and they are totally imbued with an
immeasurable kind of merit, very sharp and clear.

Help or harm done towards a person who has just come out of the path of
seeing is another example of a deed that leads to a quick result. This is true
because this person has just attained, for the first time, an unstained state
where he has gotten rid of every undesirable object eliminated by the path of
seeing.

Finally, beneficial or harmful acts towards a person who has just come out of
the state where he achieved the result of destroying the enemy also lead to the
quick experience of a result. The reason here is that the person has just
achieved, for the first time, the unstained state where he has gotten rid of
every undesirable object eliminated by the path of habituation.

Help or harm performed towards those who have just come out of a state
where they have achieved one of the two results--where they need either
return or not return to the realm of desire--does not though lead to a speedy
result. First of all, their "new" condition of having reached an unstained state
free of the objects eliminated by the path of seeing has by this time become
somewhat old. Secondly, they have yet to reach the unstained state where they
have just managed, for the first time, to rid themselves of the objects stopped
by the path of habituation.

We turn now to the third and final step in our discussion of deeds involving
a sensation of pleasure and so on. This is a presentation of the correlation
between specific sensations and the deeds from which they result. Following
the actual presentation we will go into some detail on the subject of mental
illness.

Je Tsongkapa on the Consequences of Karma
The following selection is from the Great Book on the Steps of the Path, composed
by Lord Tsongkapa (1357-1419) and found at S5392:

GSUM PA DE DAG GI 'BRAS BU LA GSUM LAS, RNAM SMIN GYI 'BRAS BU NI,
Here is the third section, a presentation on the consequences of the various
kinds of bad deeds. We proceed in three parts, beginning with what are called
the "ripened" consequences.

LAS LAM BCU PO RE RE YANG GZHI DUG GSUM CHUNG 'BRING CHE GSUM LA BRTEN PAS GSUM GSUM MO, , DE LA SROG GCOD SOGS CHEN PO BCU PO RE RES DMYAL BA, 'BRING BCU PO RE RES YI DVAGS DANG , CHUNG NGU BCU PO RE RES DUD 'GROR SKYE BAR SA'I DNGOS GZHIR GSUNGS LA,
Now each one of the ten paths of karma can itself be divided into three
kinds--lesser, medium, and greater--depending on the intensity of the three
poisons. The Main Stage of Levels states that, from the ten greater instances of
killing and the rest, one is born into the hells. It says that from medium
instances of each of the ten you take birth as an insatiable spirit; and from the
ten lesser instances, you are born as an animal.

SA BCU PA'I MDO LAS NI CHUNG 'BRING GNYIS KYI 'BRAS BU LDOG STE GSUNGS SO,
The Sutra on the Ten Levels however states the consequences of two of the kinds
of instances, the lesser and the medium, in reverse of this.

The "consistent" consequences are as follows. Even if you do manage to escape
the realms of misery and take birth as a human, the following respective
results occur to you:
1) Your life is short.
2) You don't have enough to live on.
3) You have problems keeping your partner from others.
4) People don't believe what you say, even when you're telling the truth.
5) You lose friends easily.
6) You hear things as bad sounds.
7) No one listens to you.
8) Your personality is dominated by desire.
9) Your personality is dominated by anger.
10) Your personality is dominated by stupidity.

The Chapter on the True and the Sutra on the Ten Levels state that there are two
such consequences for each of the ones given here; even if you do manage to
take birth as a human,

1) Your life is short, and you get sick easily.
2) You don't have enough to live on, and what you do have is all just
common property with others.
3) The people who work around you are "inconsistent," which here
means unreliable, and you find yourself having a lot of
competition for your partner.
4) No one believes what you say, even when you are speaking the truth,
and others are always deceiving you.
5) The people around you are always fighting against one another, and
have an undesirable character.
6) You hear many unpleasant things, and when others talk to you it
always seems to you as if they want to start a fight.
7) No one respects what you say--no one thinks that what you say has
any particular value, and you are afflicted with a lack of
confidence.
8) Your personality is dominated by desire, and you are never satisfied
with what you have.
9) You are always finding yourself without help, or never find the help
you need; and you are always hurting others, or always being
hurt by others.
10) You become a person who keeps harmful views, or a deceitful
person.

Great lamas of the past have expressed the position that it is a consequence of
consistent action where as a karmic result of killing you become someone who
takes pleasure in killing and the rest. It is a consequence of consistent
experience then when you have to undergo the results just listed.

Next is what we call the "environmental" or "dominant" consequence. Here for
example the consequence of killing expresses itself in the outer world around
you. Food, drink, medicine, the crops in the fields, and other such things have
very little power; they are always inferior; they have little nutrition or potency;
they are hard to digest, and they cause disease in you. Because of this the
majority of the living beings around you die before reaching the end of a full
life.

Because you have stolen, then the crops are few and far between; the crops
have no power to remove hunger; they spoil; they never come up; dry spells

Because you have lied, you live in a world where, when you undertake
farming or some work in cooperation with other people, in the end the work
fails to prosper, and the people can't work well together, and for the most part
everyone is cheating one another, and is afraid, and where there are many

so that you can travel only with difficulty, and where you are always afraid,
and there are many things to be afraid of.

Because you have spoken harsh words, the ground where you live is covered
with obstacles like the trunks of fallen trees, and thorns, and stones, and clods
of dirt, and lots of sharp broken pieces of glass; it's rough, and dreary; no
streams, or lakes, or springs of water; the whole earth is parched, poisoned

Because you have talked meaninglessly, fruits refuse to grow on the trees, or
they start to grow at the wrong times, never at the right times, and seem ripe
when they're still not ripe, or their roots are frail, or they can't stay long; there
are no places to take your leisure, no parks, no glades, no pools of cool water,
and many things around to make you afraid.

Because you have coveted what others have, then each and every good thing

Because you have wished bad things on others, you live in a world of chaos,
where diseases spread, and evil is everywhere, and plague, and conflict, and
fear from the armies of other nations; where there are many lions or leopards
or other dangerous animals; where there are everywhere venomous snakes or
scorpions or poison biting worms; you live surrounded by harmful spirits, and
thieves or muggers, and the like.

Because you have held wrong views, then you live in a world where the single
highest source of happiness is steadily disappearing from the earth; a world
where people think that things that are unclean and things that are suffering
are actually nice, and happiness; a world where there is no place to go, no one
to help, nothing to protect you.

The Mind-Only School on How Mental Seeds
Cause our Perceptions
The selections below are taken from the Illumination of the True Thought, found at
S5408 and written by Lord Tsongkapa:

,GNYIS PA LA GNYIS, GZHAN GYI LUGS BRJOD PA DANG , LUGS DE DGAG PA'O, , DANG PO NI, DE SKAD BSTAN PA YIN DANG SLAR YANG SEMS TZAM PAS RANG GI LUGS BRJOD PA GTZO BOR BYAS PA NYID KYIS RANG GI 'DOD DON 'GRUB PAR BSAMS SHING SMRAS PA,
. . .The second part has two sections of its own: stating the position of the other
school, and then denying this position. Here is the first.
This is how the presentation was made. Then those of the Mind-Only School
come back, considering and then presenting a position which by itself reflects
the primary belief of their entire system.

MIG GI BLO STE RNAM PAR SHES PA SKYE BA'I RANG GI NUS PA BAG CHAGS GANG ZHIG KUN GZHI LA, RNAM SHES GZHAN GYIS RANG 'GAG BZHIN PA NA, DE MA THAG TU 'JOG PAR BYED LA, DE SMIN PA LAS DUS PHYIS SNGA MA DE'I RNAM PA'I RJES SU BYED PA'I MIG GI RNAM SHES SKYE BAR 'GYUR ZHING ,
They speak first of the mental seed, the energy, from which the "mind of the
eye" (which refers to the consciousness of the eye) comes forth. Another case
of consciousness, as it is in the process of stopping, in the next moment plants
this mental seed in the foundation consciousness. When this seed ripens later,
it produces that consciousness of the eye, one which takes after the earlier one.
 RANG GI STE MIG GI RNAM SHES DE NUS PA'I SKAD CIG BAR MED PA GANG ZHIG LAS SKYE BA'I NUS PA'I SKAD CIG PAR MED PA RTEN DU GYUR PA DE LA, GTI MUG GIS 'JIG RTEN RNAMS DBANG PO GZUGS CAN MIG YIN NO SNYAM DU RTOGS KYI, RNAM SHES LAS THA DAD PA'I MIG DBANG NI YOD PA MIN NO, , DE BZHIN DU DBANG PO GZUGS CAN LHAG MA LA YANG SBYAR BAR BYA'O,
Consider now this energy as it exists immediately before producing the
consciousness of the eye related to it; consider the energy which acts as the
immediate basis for this eye consciousness. Normal people, out of ignorance,
conceive of this as the physical faculty of the eye. In truth though a power of
the eye which is something separate from consciousness is something that
doesn't even exist. This same explanation applies to all the remaining physical
faculties.

,DE LA MIG SHES SKYE BA'I RGYU BAG CHAGS NI DE'I RGYU'I RKYEN YIN LA, MIG GI DBANG PO NI MIG SHES KYI BDAG PO'I RKYEN NO,
Here the cause behind the consciousness of the eye, the mental seed, is the
primary factor behind it. The faculty of the eye is the component of the body
that provides a contributing circumstance.

,'DIR MIG DBANG MIG SHES KYI DNGOS RGYUR BSTAN PA NI, MIG SHES SKYE BA'I BAG CHAGS SMIN PA'I SKABS LA DGONGS KYI MIG DBANG GANG YIN LA MIN NO,
Here when the physical faculty of the eye is presented as the direct cause of
the consciousness of the eye, the real intent is to refer to the situation where
the mental seed which produces the eye consciousness is ripening. They are
not talking here of what we normally think of as the physical faculty of the
eye.

Regarding this the text called Middle and Extremes states,

The combination of the objects
and the person,
The base consciousness, is a consciousness
that appears;
In reality this is not the being.
Here the word "objects" refers to form and the rest, and "the person" refers to
the five faculties; the lines are describing a consciousness that arises and which
appears to be them, but which is actually foundation consciousness. Master
Stiramati also explains the physical faculties as the object of foundation
consciousness. The point then is that those of the Mind-Only School who
accept the idea of a foundation consciousness believe that the physical faculties
of the eye and so on are actually the condition of the foundation consciousness
appearing as the physical faculties.

Once they have demonstrated that there is no such thing as physical faculties
of the eye and so on that could ever be anything separate from consciousness
itself, then they must show how form as well is nothing other than
consciousness. To do this they give the following description. Consider now
the five types of consciousness that, according to general belief, arise from the
five physical faculties. It is not that there are any outside physical objects such
as the color blue and so on which the consciousness has to grasp to. Rather,
blue and the rest are only an appearance which occurs through the ripening
of the very mental seed which was planted in the foundation consciousness
and from which consciousness itself has arisen. Not realizing this fact, people
look at the mind appearing as blue or whatever and accept or interpret these
appearances as being outer objects.

How the Middle-Way School Says
the Mental Seeds of Karma Work

Here is the second part [of a different] discussion [about where the
Madhyamika school believes the mental seeds from karma are planted, since
they do not accept the concept of foundation consciousness]. One may begin
with the following question:
Suppose you deny then the existence of a foundation
consciousness. Nonetheless you must accept that mental seeds
from virtue or non-virtue do get planted, and that consequences
do arise from the ripening of these mental seeds. After all, the
autocommentary to Entering the Middle Way does state that "For
time without beginning, in the suffering cycle of life, the mental
seeds for things have been planted, and have then ripened, and
have then been interpreted by people as the things themselves."
There are as well many other quotations which mention the same
thing. And it would be incorrect to say that there existed no
basis or place where these mental seeds were planted. What
then, according to your view, provides this place for the seeds to
be planted?

DE BZHIN DU LUGS 'DIS KYANG NGA'O SNYAM PA TZAM GYI BLO LHAN SKYES KYI DMIGS PA DE NYID BAG CHAGS SGO BA'I GZHIR BZHED DO,
According to those who accept the idea of a foundation consciousness, the
thing called "afflicted mind" focuses on foundation consciousness and holds it
to be "me"; they say that this foundation consciousness then is the place where
the mental seeds stay. In our [Madhyamika] school too we have a similar
concept; we say that the base which is stained with the mental seed is exactly
that thing that you focus on with your simple, natural awareness of yourself
and call "me."

One may ask the following:
The autocommentary to Entering the Middle Way states that the
stream of the mind is the basis where the mental seeds are
planted. How does this fit into what you have just said?
The very thing we call the simple "me" is something which results from a label
being applied to the mind, or consciousness. It also goes on in a stream. From
this point of view then we can also refer to it as the "stream of the mind." And
even if what you mean by a "stream" is the continuation of later, similar
instances of mind itself, you can say that it too is the basis which is stained by
mental seeds of particular occasions.

Here is how the mental seed for ignorance works. The autocommentary to
Entering the Middle Way says,
That thing which tends to stop, and yet still stain, and then
continue on in the flow of the mind is what we refer to as a
'mental seed.' The expressions 'continuity' and 'habit' and 'root'
and 'mental seed' for the state of mental affliction all refer to the
same thing. This is something that Listeners and Self-Made
"Buddhas" are unable to eliminate even though they may already
have eliminated the state of mental affliction itself through using
the unstained path. It's similar to what happens with sesame
butter or flowers; you may already remove these things from the
scene, but the vase in which the flowers were, or the piece of
cloth that the butter stained, still retain some subtle trace of them
due to the previous contact.
How then could there be any sense to saying that there is another basis, a
second one, on top of the one mentioned here, where other types of mental
seeds, like those of virtuous deeds and non-virtuous deeds and the rest, are
planted?

One might wonder about something else:
Let's talk about the period while you are in the "uninterrupted"
stage of the path of seeing [the actual direct perception of
emptiness]. I can accept that at this point the negative thoughts
eliminated by this path are no longer present, but we would have
to say that the negative things eliminated by the path of
habituation are still there, in a dormant way. At this particular
point in time, the consciousness of the mind is unstained,
unaffected by the mental seed which causes the mistaken state of
mind where the appearance and actuality of things are different
from one another. As such none of these things could lie
dormant here, due to its very quality at the time. There is no
consciousness of the senses that could act as the basis for those
mental seeds, and it would be improper to say that physical form
could ever provide such a basis either. According to you,
moreover, there's no foundation consciousness. I would have to
think then that there is no basis at all where these dormant things
could stay.
And yet there is no such problem, for at this point in time it is the simple "me"
which is providing the basis for the dormant things eliminated by the path of
habituation to stay. You can apply this reasoning as well to all the other cases
involving things to be eliminated, and the antidotes which eliminate them.

The Middle-Way School on the Question of Where the Seeds of
Karma Stay until They Give their Result

,GNYIS PA NI, DNGOS PO RANG BZHIN GYIS GRUB PA MED PAR 'DOD PA'I PHYOGS LA, KUN GZHI SOGS KHAS MA BLANGS KYANG LAS 'BRAS KYI 'BREL PA 'THAD TSUL JI LTAR YIN ZHE NA,
Here is the second point [of still another discussion]. One may ask the
following:

Those who believe that entities have no natural existence
[meaning the Madhyamika Prasangika (or Consequence) School]
do not accept the concepts of a foundation consciousness and the
like; how then is it that they can still assert that all the workings
of karma and its consequences are totally right and proper?

All the Buddhist schools, whether higher schools or lower schools, accept the
principle that the consequences of pleasure and pain and so on arise from
virtuous and non-virtuous karma or actions, even though the original karma
and its eventual consequences may be separated by a very long period of time.
The problem though is that, if the karma stays around during the entire period
up to the point at which it gives its consequence, it would have to be
unchanging. An unchanging thing though is incapable of affecting anything,
and so you could never have a relationship where karma gave rise to any
consequence.

,LAS DE BYAS PA'I SKAD CIG GNYIS PAR ZHIG NA NI, MTSAMS DE NAS 'BRAS BU DNGOS SU 'BYIN PA'I SNGA LOGS KYI BAR DU LAS DE MED LA, LAS ZHIG PA YANG DNGOS POR MED PAS LAS LAS 'BRAS BU JI LTAR 'BYUNG BAR 'GYUR ZHES BRTZAD PA'I LAN DU,
From the moment after you complete a karma or deed, that deed is finished
and gone. During the entire period from that point up to the point at which
the consequence actually occurs, the deed no longer exists. A deed which is
already gone is no longer a thing that can have any affect on anything. How
then does a deed or karma ever produce any kind of consequence? Here is
how we explain this problem:

LAS BYAS PA'I SKAD CIG GNYIS PAR 'GAGS ZIN PA'I SNGA LOGS KYI LAS 'GAG PA LA MNGON DU PHYOGS PA'I TSE, LAS KYI NUS PA GZHAG PAR BYA BA'I PHYIR KHA CIG KUN GZHI RNAM PAR SHES PA RTOG PAR BYED LA, KHA CIG BU LON GYI DPANG RGYA STE DE'I YI GE DANG 'DRA BA'I LAS GNYIS LAS DON GZHAN PA, CHUD MI ZA BA ZHES PA LDAN MIN 'DU BYED DU GYUR PA CIG 'DOD DO, , KHA CIG NI LAS GNYIS KYI THOB PA ZHES PA DE GNYIS LAS DON GZHAN DU GYUR PA'I LDAN MIN ZHIG RTOG PAR BYED DO,
Let's consider the deed or karma as it exists up to the point right after the
moment in which the deed is completed; that is, let's consider the deed as it
approaches its end. The energy of the deed has to be stored somewhere, and
so some thinkers have invented the idea of some kind of foundation
consciousness for it to stay. Others have said that there is something which is
changing but neither mental nor physical, something they call "the fact of not
just going away"; they say it is something that exists separately from the two
types of deeds [virtue and non-virtue], and that it resembles the document
written up for a loan that has to be repaid. Still others have invented the idea
that there is another changing thing which is neither mental nor physical, again
different from the two kinds of deeds themselves, something they call a "hold."

Others finally have invented the idea of a stream of consciousness which is
stained with the mental seed of the deed. This then is why, they say, that it
is no contradiction for the deed to produce its consequence later, even after a
very long time. The deed or karma plants a mental seed in the foundation
consciousness, and so the mental seed is the result of the deed. This mental

seed continues on in a stream of similar forms until eventually it produces the
consequence. Thus, they say, the consequence of the original karma is
something that is produced indirectly, via a medium. This same type of idea
applies to the other three positions expressed.

The first of these positions belongs to a certain group within the Mind-Only
School. The second position is explained by Master Avalokitavrata to be that
of the Detailist School--of a certain section other than the Kashmiri Detailists.
The third position also belongs to a specific group within the Detailist School.
It is not completely clear where the fourth position belongs, but since it is
consistent with the ninth chapter of the autocommentary to the Treasure House
of Knowledge (Abhidharmakosha), it would appear to be an alternate belief of the
Sutrists and the Kashmiri Detailists.

Although the Kashmiris do accept the idea of a "hold," they do not assert that
a hold could be produced by the two types of karma as something retained by
the hold. The position here though belongs to someone who does assert this,
and this is the point of the phrase "according to someone."
According to someone now of the Madhyamika Consequence school, the deed
or karma is not something which arises in and of itself, and so, for this very
reason, neither is it something which finishes through any nature of its own.
Nonetheless it is no contradiction to say that something which never finishes
through any nature of its own can still produce a consequence. As such a
consequence can come from a deed even if we never accept the idea of a
foundation consciousness or the like.
You must understand then that this is why the two kinds of karma can already
have finished in the mental continuum of any given sentient being, and yet still
after a long time--even after the passing of many millions of years--these
deeds can nonetheless produce their consequences "perfectly," which is to say,
without any confusion. [That is, good deeds lead to pleasure, and bad deeds
lead to pain, and there is never any case where this law somehow goes wrong,
and good deeds lead to pain, or bad deeds to pleasure.]
Given all this, the connection between deeds and their consequences is, in this
school, purely and totally correct.

The point of all this is that all four of the positions above, as they attempt to
answer the problem raised, do so from a viewpoint of accepting that a deed

has a beginning that exists by definition and an ending too that exists by
definition. They are agreeing as well that the later condition of the deed's
having ended is something that exists by definition. The Master [Chandrakirti]
is stating that it is improper to answer the problem raised above by saying
that, "Even though the ending of the deed is that way, it's no problem, because
we believe in foundation consciousness." He is denying all these positions, for
the reason that there simply doesn't even exist any beginning or ending of a
deed that could occur through any nature of its own.

The Master, to demonstrate how this way of answering reflects exactly the
position of the Arya [Nagarjuna], quotes the following statement from the Root
Text on Wisdom:
Because the karma never begins,
Because it has no nature of its own,
And since it has never even begun,
Neither then can it simply go away.
The lines are saying that, because there is no such thing as a karma that exists
through its own nature, no such karma could ever have a beginning that came
in and of itself. Because of this, it is completely impossible for a karma ever
to end by any nature of its own. It is illogical to think of the subsequent
condition of the deed's having ended and invent some idea of something that
can never just go away.

What the Middle-Way School Means When it Says Things are
Just the Results of Projection

This section [still another one] has two parts to it. First we will show how it
is that objects are established through the process of projecting, and then
describe what it is to grasp to true existence, wherein one holds things as
existing in the opposite way. Here is the first.
The Sutra Requested by Upali includes the following lines:
A splash of pleasing flowers open their petals,
Golden palaces blaze in breathtaking beauty;
Look for their maker, but you'll never find him,
For all of these are built of projections--
The world is an invention of projections.
The verse is describing how objects are established through the process of
projection, and there are as well many other statements of the Buddha that
describe how every single object in the universe is nothing more than a
creation of projections.

The Sixty Verses on Reasoning say as well,
The world is something that ignorance causes;
Why? For the Buddhas say it is so.
And why then would it be wrong to say
That this world is only projections.
The meaning of this verse, according to the commentary, is that none of the
many worlds that exist does so through some essence of its own: none of them
are anything more than products of our projections.

The 400 Verses says as well:
Without projections, desire and such
Are nothing that can even exist;
Why then would anyone with a brain
Believe in reality and projection?
The commentary to the work states that--
Things that can't even exist in the absence of projections are, beyond
any manner of doubt, absolutely things that cannot exist through any
essence of their own: they are like a coil of rope you label with "snake."
The expression "reality" here refers to something that could exist through its
own essence. "Projection" is the fact that things occur through the process of
projection.

When this commentary states that "desire and such" are like a piece of rope
labelled "snake," it is only giving a single example; what it means to say is that
each and every other existing object is as well like a rope called a snake: they
are all established through the process of projection.
Here the colored pattern of the rope and the way it's coiled make it resemble
a snake; and if you're in a place where you can't see it very clearly, then you
start to think to yourself, "It's a snake!" The fact though is that there is nothing
about the rope as a whole, nor anything about its various parts, that you could
ever establish as being one kind of a snake; the snake of the rope, then, is
nothing but a creation of projections.

The same thing happens when you get the idea of "me" about the heaps, the
various components to yourself. There is nothing about these components as
a whole, when you consider them as a continuum in time, nor as a whole
considered in a single moment in time, nor as the various parts to a whole, that
you could ever establish as being any kind of "me." We'll go into this in more
detail further on.

Because of this fact, and since moreover there is not the slightest thing outside
of the parts or whole of the components to yourself that you could ever
consider any kind of "me," this "me" is nothing more than a creation of
projection, based on the components. There is no "me" which exists through
any essence of its own.

Now the Sixty Verses on Reasoning says,

Why? For the Buddhas say it is so.
And why then would it be wrong to say
That this world is only projections.
If one were to end his ignorance,
Then how is it that the thing that's ended,
Despite our misunderstanding, could never
Disappear, even in projections?

The meaning of the lines is as follows. If things existed in their very essence,
then they would exist as some independent reality. If this were so, then when
you finally stopped your mistaken states of mind, they would never disappear,
although they should have.

The mind is the main thing; and to show this, the following explanation
appears in the scripture:
The world, in the form of those who live in it, finds its very
being through the power of the karma they have collected with
their minds, and through the bad thoughts in their minds. All
the vast multitude of worlds too, in the form of the places where
these beings live, have been put there, have been produced, by
the collective karma of these same beings, and no one else--by
the karma within their own minds. This refers to everything up
to the farthest reaches of the world, from the great disc of wind
that underpins our planet up to the highest temporary heaven,
the one named "Below No Other."

On this subject, the intricate patterns on a peacock and other such
objects are produced by each one's personal karma. The
intricacies of the petals and colors of a lotus flower and other
such things are produced by the collective karma of living beings.
You can apply these principles to all other cases as well.

As the verse goes,
It's through the karma of living beings
That the great dark mountains arise in their time.
It's like the hells, and the heavens above,
And swords, and jewels, and trees in the world.
The great books of the Mind-Only School also discuss whether the two worlds
[of beings and the place they live] are produced by karma that is collective or
not, and so it's not as though the system of the Mind Only denies the existence
of the world where beings live.

And so it is spoken, that all the living beings of the universe are produced by
karma. And if somehow you could stop all minds, then karma itself would
cease to be, for it is only through mind and what comes along with it that

karma can be collected. Therefore karma itself depends on the mind. So the
statement from the Sutra of the Ten Levels, where it says that there is no great
master of all things, and no great maker of all things, conveys one meaning of
the word "only" in the expression "mind-only"; the point is that there is no
other creator of things than the mind itself.

It is stated in scripture as well that each and every one of the twelve links in
the chain of interdependence depends on a single thing: the mind. These
references convey yet another meaning of the word "only" in the expression
"mind-only." Here the point is that mind is the main thing. The former
scriptural references are putting their point in a negative way, and the latter
references are putting their point in a positive way.
Thus we can see that it's the mind which is the one single principal cause that
sets all life into motion. The principal cause is not something other than the
mind. Therefore when the sutras speak of "mind only," they are making the
point that mind is the main thing, and not matter. Although we do of course
admit that physical matter exists, this matter is not the one prime creator of
sentient beings in the way that mind is.
Therefore all these scriptural references are denying that the opposite of the
mind, something other than the mind, could be the creator. They are not
though saying that there are no outside physical objects at all.

On the Cause of Our Suffering
The following selections are from the Overview of the Middle Way, composed by
Master Kedrup Tenpa Dargye (1493-1568).

Let us first consider enemy destroyers of the Listener or Self-Made Buddha
type. Aren't you saying then that, like the non-Buddhists, they fail to eliminate
all the widespread mental afflictions that operate in all three realms? Because
isn't it true that they have failed to achieve the path which is directly
incompatible, in the way it holds its object, with the root of all these afflictions;
that is, the tendency to conceive of things as existing through some nature of
their own? And this is true, for they lack that comprehensive knowledge
where they realize that things have no nature of their own.

Consider these same enemy destroyers. It is true that they have not yet
realized, entirely, the fact that the person has no self nature. This is because
they have yet to perceive directly the fact that the person has no nature. This
in itself is true as well, for they are still chained by total misperceptions, in
such a way that they will never be able to root out the object that they think
they see when they hold the parts to the person, the thing which gets the label
of "me," as existing from its own side. And this too is true, for they lack that
comprehensive knowledge where they realize that the parts to the person have
no nature of their own.

The first of our logical statements above is always true. For suppose that a
person is still unable to root out the object that he thinks he sees when he
holds the parts to the person, the thing which gets the label of "me," as existing
through some nature of its own. As long as he goes on this way, then he will
continue to find himself unable to root out the object that he thinks he sees
when he holds the thing which gets the label, the "me," as existing from its
own side. And as long as he continues with this, then by the power of this
misperception he will continue to collect karma. And as long as he collects
karma, then he will continue to spin around in this wheel of suffering life.

This then is the ultimate idea within the root text and the commentary of the
Higher Line, [written by Maitreya and Asanga]:
Due to the mental seeds for the two kinds of tendencies to grasp to some self-
nature, these two tendencies themselves spring up.
Due to the fact that they have sprung up, an impression with a wrong way of
looking at things springs up, and some things seem as though they are
pleasant from their own side, and other things seem as though they are
unpleasant from their own side.
Due to the fact that this impression has sprung up, the emotion of liking
springs up, where you focus on a pleasant object and don't want to lose it.
And the emotion of disliking springs up, where you focus on an unpleasant
object and want to avoid it.
This then forces you to collect karma.
And karma forces you to spin around in the wheel of suffering life.
And this is why the Buddhas have said that this suffering life is something
forced on us because we have not been able to see, directly, the essence of the
Ones Gone Thus [that is, emptiness].

Here we will analyze the statement [from Entering the Middle Way, by Master
Chandrakirti (650 AD)] where it says, "...The mind of a craving spirit as well,
which sees a stream of water as pus." One may begin with the following
question:
Let's consider the objects of the following states of mind: the
visual consciousness of a craving spirit where a river of water
looks like pus and blood; the visual consciousness of a person
with a kind of cataract where a clean white porcelain basin looks
like a hair has fallen into it; and that kind of meditation where
you visualize skeletons--where you imagine that the entire
surface of the earth is covered with the bones of corpses. Are all
these objects completely equivalent, as far as being something
that exists or doesn't exist?

In reply we will first set forth a relevant passage, and then we will explicate
the passage. Here is the first. The text called The Abbreviation of the Greater
Way says,

Insofar as craving spirits, animals,
Humans, and pleasure beings, each according
To their class, have differing perceptions
Of a single thing, we say it has no reality.
Asvabhava, the venered layman with lifetime vows, has explained the passage.
His words include the following:

When they look at a single thing, a stream of water, each one sees
what the ripening of his particular karma forces him to see. A
craving spirit sees the river full of pus and blood and the like.

dissolved altogether.

Here secondly we will explain the meaning of the text we quoted first. We
proceed in three steps: disproving the position of others, establishing our own
position, and then refuting their rebuttal. Here is the first.

Someone may make the following claim:
Given the statements that have come above, the fact is that we
should never again consider anything as being one way or the
other.
Well then, you must be suggesting that the system of the Buddha is all the
same as the system of every non-Buddhist belief, that there is no difference in
their correctness at all. And you must be saying too that we could never state
that our Teacher was the highest teacher, and that the teachers of the non-
Buddhists are lesser.

And you must be suggesting all this, for you have claimed that we should
never again consider anything as being one way or the other.

Now if you should agree that none of the differences mentioned above exist,
we must reply that they do, for as the verse says:
All other teachers now I've given up,
And go for refuge now to only You;
Why? Because it's You alone who has
No fault, and perfected every good.

Someone else might make the following claim:
Suppose a pleasure being, a human, and a craving spirit sit down
together and look at a glass filled with water: the thing that we
define as "wet and flowing." Since to the perceptions of each
different type of being it is real, the glass full of wet and flowing
water is in reality pus and blood to the eyes of the craving spirit,
and in reality water to the eyes of the human, and in reality
ambrosia to the eyes of the pleasure being.

We ask you then a question: in the situation you've just described, is it that the
visual consciousness of all three beings are a valid perception, or is it that only
one or two of them are a valid perception? Suppose you say all three are
valid. Well then, the glass of wet and flowing water must be full of something
that is all three different things: pus and blood, and each of the others. And
then too it must be possible for there to be multiple and yet still valid
perceptions which see one thing in two completely incompatible ways. And
finally there must be such a thing as a valid perception which correctly
perceives that the glass is filled with something which is simultaneously water
and yet not water. Why so? Because, according to your view, the three
differing cases of visual consciousness possessed by the three different beings
would all have to be valid perception.

And if you try to agree to these absurdities, you are wrong, for the quality of
being pus and blood is incompatible with the quality of being either one of the
other two substances mentioned. Moreover, the quality of being water and the
quality of not being water are directly incompatible in such a way that, if
something exists and lacks one of these qualities, it must then possess the
other.
31
Which of the Perceptions are Valid?

Someone may answer with the following claim:
In the case mentioned, the visual consciousness of the human is
a valid perception, but the visual consciousnesses of the other
two types of beings are not valid perception. These latter two
see something like the pus and blood, and the ambrosia, only
because their karma (which is good in one case, and bad in the
other) forces them to.

Well then, according to you, the visual consciousness of the human wouldn't
be valid perception either. Because isn't it true that the human sees the water
only because his karma (which in this case is halfway between the good and
the bad just mentioned) forces him to? Moreover, aren't you implying then
that there is no such thing as a valid tactile consciousness, or a valid auditory
consciousness, in the mental stream of any being who is not a human?
Because aren't you saying that there's no such thing as a valid visual
consciousness in the mental stream of any such being? Certainly you are, for
you believe your original position to be correct. And suppose now that you
do agree that such beings can have no such valid consciousnesses.

Aren't you then implying that these beings never have any case where they are
able to reach a definite conclusion about something, or to analyze an object?
And if so, aren't you implying that there could never be a case where one of
these beings could recognize another? Of course you are, given your position.

Here secondly is the section where we establish our own position. Now
suppose three different types of beings--a pleasure being, a human, and a
craving spirit, each with their own karma--sit down together and look upon
a glass filled with water, the thing we define as "wet and flowing." The glass
of water is not at this point one thing which is simultaneously three different
objects. Neither is it necessary in this situation for there to be three identical
valid perceptions. And when the glass full of wet and flowing water occurs,
it occurs with three different, distinct parts to it.

It is not though the case that, from the time it first started, the glass of water
came with the three different parts, or that they stay with the glass of water
until it eventually ends. What happens is that one of the parts of the glass
filled with wet and flowing water provides a material cause, and the karma of
the craving spirit provides a contributing factor; and then based on both of
these the later continuation of one part of the glass of water starts being blood
and pus.

DE'I CHA SHAS GCIG GIS NYER LEN DANG , MI'I LAS KYIS LHAN CIG BYED RKYEN BYAS PA LA BRTEN NAS DE'I CHA SHAS GCIG GI RIGS 'DRA PHYI MA CHUR SKYE BA DANG ,
Another part of the glass of water again provides a material cause, and the
karma of the human provides a contributing factor; and then based on both of
these the later continuation of one part of the glass of water starts being water.

Yet another part of the glass of water provides a material cause, and the karma
of the pleasure being provides a contributing factor; and then based on both
of these the later continuation of one part of the glass of water starts being
ambrosia, and so on.

At this point, the glass full of wet and flowing water is something with three
different parts. Nonetheless, it is not the case that all three different beings see
all three parts. The craving spirit is forced by the bad karma he has collected
to see the glass of water as pus and blood; and he doesn't see the other two
things. One should understand that a similar case holds with the latter two
types of beings.

What we just described as happening is only with reference to where a glass
of something wet and flowing is an object shared by the three different beings,
as they look at it together. When the craving spirit himself though picks up
the glass in his hand and begins to partake of its contents, the glass of liquid
is no longer something that exists with three different parts. Since at this point

it is something that the craving spirit is experiencing exclusively, its
continuation starts being pus and blood.

How the glass of liquid exists originally all depends on the particular outer
world from where it has been taken, for each of the three different beings has
a different outer world, depending on the specific karma he himself has
collected. If the glass of liquid were sweet, cool water taken from the world
of humans--a world created by the specific karma of the human in the
group--then that would be its original condition, and so on.

pus and blood there? Because isn't it true that the burning steel
and so on in the hells is only something that appears to a person
who is born there, but that there is nothing there which actually
is these objects? Because isn't it true that there is no one at all
who went and made all these kinds of things? And isn't this a
fact, because doesn't the text of The Bodhisattva's Way of Life say:
Who made the burning steel that acts
As the floor of the world of hell?
Where did all the mass of flames
You find there all come from?
The Able Ones have spoken that
Everything there like this
Is nothing at all other than
The mind of what's non-virtue.

Yet there is no such problem. The point of this quotation is to say that the
burning steel and so on are not something that was created by some
unchanging creator being or something like that; by someone who thought it
over first and then created them. The lines are meant to show us that what
really made all these things is the non-virtuous states of mind had by the
beings who have to take birth there.

If this were not the case, then consider those holy people who lead their lives
following the ten virtues, and who are then born into the higher realms, and

then experience the pleasures of these realms. And consider too those
miserable people who lead their lives following the ten non-virtues, and who
are then born into the lower realms, and then experience the sufferings of these
realms. Is the difference between them just that they are having some better
or worse kind of misperception, and not whether they are experiencing
pleasure or pain? This would have to be the case, if your reasoning were
correct.

'DOD NA, MTHO RIS KYI BDE BA DANG , NGAN SONG GI SDUG BSNGAL MED PAR THAL, 'DOD PA DE'I PHYIR,
Suppose you agree that it is only a matter of better or worse misperceptions.
Are you saying then that the pleasures of the higher realms don't even exist,
and that the pains of the lower realms don't even exist? You must be, if you
agree this way.

In conclusion now, let us consider again these three kinds of beings, each with
their different karma, as they sit down together and look at a glass full of
something wet and flowing. It's not necessarily true that they must all have
valid perceptions which are identical. If they did, then the three beings
looking at the glass of water would have to think of the water as a place to
live, in the way that a creature living in water would. The three beings as well
would have to see the water in the same way that microscopic organisms

living in the water, little beings imperceptible to normal visual consciousness,
see it with their own visual consciousness. Then too the visual consciousness
of microscopic organisms living in the depths of the ocean would have to be
a valid perception towards the entire extent of the sea. And certain kinds of
near-gods too would have to see weapons as glasses of water, and on and on;
the problems raised would be many.

Again consider this same situation. Even though it is not necessarily true that
the valid perceptions are identical, it is possible for there to be three valid
perceptions here which happen to be identical. This is because, as we have
already established logically, there can be a case where by the force of karma
three different objects, each one confirmed by a valid perception, start to exist.
And since this is possible, then it is equally possible that, by the force of
karma, three equivalent valid perceptions of a vessel could start to exist as
well.

Generally speaking, each of the three objects mentioned--the pus and the other
two--are things of the type that block other objects from entering into the
space which they themselves occupy. It is no contradiction though to say that,

in this situation where the beings are looking this way, they are not objects
such that they block other things from entering into the space they occupy.
This is true for the following reason.
A central mountain of the world which is square in shape, and a central
mountain of the world which is round in shape, and the like, are objects such
that they block other things from entering the space they occupy.
Nevertheless, it is possible for both these things to occupy the space taken up
by a single central mountain of the world. A red-hot ball of steel is something
that's hot, but consider what happens when a person touches it after he has
used the mantra of steel on his hand. The sensation that he feels is not a
sensation of heat; on the contrary, it is a sensation of something not heat.

Now sutra states that there are three types of killing: that which comes from
desiring something, that which comes from disliking something, and that
which comes from being ignorant of things. One may ask then whether the
various paths of action are each brought to completion by these three roots of
all non-virtue.

MIN TE, MDO LAS GSUNGS PA NI SROG GCOD PA LTA BU'I SBYOR BA RTZA BA GSUM LAS SKYES PA LA DGONGS SO,
The answer is that they are not. The statement from sutra was made only with
reference to the fact that the "undertaking" stages of deeds such as killing
come from the root three.

One may next ask for a description of the process by which the "undertaking"
stages of the ten non-virtues come from the three roots of non-virtue. Let's
start with the act of killing. The "undertaking" stage of this type of act comes
from desire in a case where, for example, you take the life of another being in
order to get its flesh to eat. An instance where this stage comes from dislike
would be where you kill your enemy. And a case where the undertaking stage
comes from being ignorant of things would be where you kill someone like
your father or mother out of some meritorious intent.

Next let's consider the act of stealing. An example of the "undertaking" stage
for this act coming from desire would be where you steal something of value
out of a longing for it. A case where this stage comes from dislike would be,
for example, where you steal something of value from your enemy. An

example of the "undertaking" stage for stealing coming from ignorance is
exemplified by the description that "It's religion when a Brahmin steals."

Sexual misconduct that comes from desire would be a case where, for example,
one engages in some wrong kind of sexual activity because of lustful feelings.
Sexual misconduct born from dislike would be represented by engaging in
sexual intercourse in order to harm someone else's reputation. Sexual
misconduct that you do from ignorance is typified in the statement that "Sex
should be enjoyed by everyone together, like the flowers and the fruits of the
earth, like a banquet ready for the feast, like a pool in the river, like a public
road."

Coveting and the rest of the three misdeeds of thought come from these three
roots of non-virtue because they occur just subsequent to them--to these three
roots. The ten virtues, and here we consider them with all their various stages
(undertaking and conclusion, as well as actual commission), come from the
states of possessing no desire for something, no dislike for a thing, and no
ignorance of things.

completion by desire.

"Suppose," one may begin, "that a person takes a weapon and delivers a blow
to someone else which is sure to kill him, but then this murderer himself
happens to die, either before his victim or together with him--at the same
time. Can we say then that the actual "commission" stage of a full path of
action has occurred for such a murderer, or not?"

The answer is that there is no occurrence of this stage for such a person. In
the first place, the stage cannot occur before the victim dies; in the second
place, where the murderer dies at the same time as his victim, another body
of the killer has been born. There is no actual commission because the body
never went through the stage of undertaking this act towards the victim in
question.

One may raise another question: "Suppose a group of people are engaged in
a war or similar activity, and one of these people kills someone from the other
side. Does a path of action occur only for the one person who actually did the
killing?" It does not. Because they are engaged in the war (or whatever
activity it may be) for the same common goal, all the people involved come to
possess a full path of action, just as much as the one who commits it.

Next we present the definition of each individual non-virtue. We start with the

"What," one may ask, "is the basic nature of each of the ten non-virtues?" The
taking of life is defined as killing another being purposely, and without a
mistake. The word "purposely" is meant to indicate that there is no problem
like where the being in question has died but there was no intent.

The words "without a mistake" are meant to indicate that no "actual-
commission" stage of an act occurs in a case of mistaken identity; for example,
in a case where you undertake to kill John but instead kill Joe because you
have mistaken him for John. The word "another," finally, is meant to indicate
that no "actual-commission" stage occurs either in an instance where one takes
his own life.

Stealing is to take possession of another's wealth, purposely and without a

Sexual misconduct is engaging in kinds of sex which are improper to

This sexual misconduct is of four different types, as the number of the
following list each constitutes one of its forms:
1) sex with someone else's wife or with a woman who, although she is
not another person's wife, is too closely related to oneself--his
mother, or sister, or any female related to one up to seven
generations past;
2) sex with a woman, even is she is one's wife, using an improper part
of her body--her mouth or anus;
3) sex in an improper place--out in the open or in the environs of a
shrine or temple; and
4) sex at an improper time--while a baby is still nursing from the

Coveting consists of a wrong (that is, an improper) desire for another's
wealth, which leads to a wish that one make it his own. Harmful intent is the
desire to hurt another living being, a desire which comes from the attitude of
hating him. And mistaken view is the idea that neither virtue nor non-virtue
even exists.
Next we discuss the literal meaning of the expression "a path of action."
40
Explanation of the Expression "Path of Action"

   'DI LA,
,GSUM LAM BDUN NI LAS KYANG YIN,
In them,
Three are paths, seven deeds as well.
[IV.311b-12]

,GSUM PA NI, BCU PO 'DI LA CI'I PHYIR LAS KYI LAM ZHES BYA ZHE NA, YID KYI GSUM LAS SEMS PA 'JUG PA'I LAM YIN PA DANG , LUS NGAG GI BDUN NI LAS KYANG YIN LA, SEMS PA 'JUG PA'I LAM YANG YIN PAS NA LAS KYI LAM ZHES BYA'O,
One may ask why the expression "path of action" is used in reference to
"them"--to the group of ten just listed. The name derives first of all from the
fact that the three involved with thought are paths by which the "action" or
deed of mental movement is expressed. Moreover, the seven involved with
body and speech are action or deeds themselves, as well as paths through
which mental movement is expressed. Thus they are all "paths of action."

41
The Parts of a Karmic Act
For the next selections, we return to Je Tsongkapa's Great Book on the Steps of the
Path.

,DANG PO NI, SROG GCOD PA GANG ZHE NA, 'DI LA BSDU BAR GZHI DANG 'DU SHES DANG BSAM PA DANG NYON MONGS DANG MTHA' STE LNGAR GSUNGS KYANG , BAR PA GSUM BSAM PAR BSDUS TE SBYOR BA BSNAN NAS GZHI DANG BSAM PA DANG SBYOR BA DANG MTHAR THUG BZHI BZHIR BSDUS TE BSHAD NA 'JUG PA BDE ZHING DGONGS PA DANG MI 'GAL LO, ,
Here is the first. One may ask, "How do you define the act of killing?" The
Abbreviation says that five parts are involved: the object, the conception, the
thinking, the bad thought, and the conclusion. These five can be shortened
into four: the middle three can be included into the thinking, and we can add
the stage of undertaking; this makes the presentation easier, and in no way
violates the intention of the original text.

Now the object for killing is a sentient being: anything with life. The Levels of
Practitioners does state "another living being," but is only referring to the fact
that, when the murderer is murdering himself, there is a wrong deed of
undertaking, but not one of completion.

The part of the thinking has three components of its own. Conception can be
of four different types: to conceive of the object, say a living being, as being a
living being; to conceive of a living being as something other than a living
being; to conceive of something other than a living being as being other than
a living being, and to conceive of this same thing as a living being. The first
and third types of conception here are unmistaken; the second and fourth are
mistaken.

'DI LA KUN SLONG BYE BRAG CAN DPER NA, LHAS BYIN KHO NA BSAD SNYAM NAS SBYOR BA BRTZAMS PA NA MCHOD SBYIN DU NOR NAS BSAD NA, DNGOS GZHI'I SDIG MED PAS DE LTA BU LA 'DU SHES MA 'KHRUL BA DGOS SHING , SBYOR BA'I DUS SU GANG BYUNG YANG GSOD SNYAM PA KUN SLONG SPYI LA ZHUGS PA YOD NA 'DU SHES MA 'KHRUL BA MI DGOS SO, , TSUL 'DI NI LHAG MA DGU LA YANG CI RIGS PAR SHES PAR BYA'O, ,
This is a particular feature of the motivation. Suppose, for example, that you
think to yourself, "I only want to kill John," and undertake the deed. Then you
mistake Joe for John, and kill Joe. In this sort of case, there is no "actual-
commission" stage; so we can see that, for this stage, the conception you have
must be unmistaken. If on the other hand you undertake the deed with some
general kind of motivation, if you think to yourself, "I'll kill anyone I happen
to meet," then this detail of the conception having to be unmistaken need not
be complete. You should understand that this point applies to the other nine
as well.

NYON MONGS PA NI, DUG GSUM GANG RUNG NGO , ,
The second component of the thinking is the bad thought involved. In this
case, it can be any of the three poisons.
A third component is the motivation; here, it is the wish to kill.

Here are the different aspects of the undertaking. As far as the one who
undertakes the deed, it doesn't matter whether you perform it yourself, or get
someone else to do it for you, it's all the same. The essence of the undertaking
is when the deed is initiated, either with some kind of weapon, or poison, or
spell, or whatever the case may be.

The conclusion occurs when, due to this undertaking of the deed, the other
person dies, either at the time of the undertaking, or later on. As the Treasure
House of Knowledge says,
There is no actual stage for those who die
Before or together, for another body's been born.

The Motivation for Negative Karma

The movements of the mind are an action (karma) but not a path of action.
The seven of body and speech are both an action and--because they are the
basis in which the movement of the mind engages--are also a path of action.
The three of coveting and so on are a path of action but not themselves action
(karma).

How Most Basic Virtue is Lost
We return now to the commentary of His Holiness the First Dalai Lama:

,MED PAR LTA BAS RTZA BA GCOD,
,'DOD GTOGS SKYES NAS THOB PA RNAMS,
,RGYU DANG 'BRAS LA SKUR 'DEBS PAS,
,KUN GYIS RIM GYIS MI'I NANG DU,

,LTA SPYAD DE NI MI LDAN PA'O,
Most basic lost by the view they don't exist;
Taken in the desire, had from birth.
Through the one denying cause and effect,
And through all. In stages, among humans,
Lost by those who are male or female, by the
Intellectual. This is not to have it.
[IV.313-8]

,BZHI PA NI, MI DGE BA GANG GIS DGE RTZA GCOD CE NA, MED PAR LTA BAS DGE BA'I RTZA BA GCOD PAR BYED DO,
One may ask just what kind of non-virtue can make one lose his most basic
virtue. The most basic virtue that a person possesses is lost by the view that
certain important objects don't even exist.

,JI LTA BU ZHE NA, 'DOD PAR GTOGS PA'I DGE RTZA GCOD KYI, GZUGS GZUGS MED KYI DGE RTZA MI GCOD DE, DE'I RGYUD LA DE MED PA'I PHYIR,
One may next ask how the process occurs. Most basic virtue which is taken
in by the realm of desire can be lost, but not that which is taken in by the
form or formless realms. This is because the types of views required can never
appear in the mental streams of the beings of these realms.

'DOD PAR GTOGS PA'I YANG SKYES NAS THOB PA GCOD KYI, SBYOR BYUNG MI GCOD DE, LOG LTA CHUNG NGU'I CHUNG NGU'I GNAS SKABS SU DE'I THOB PA CHAD NAS MED PA'I PHYIR,
Even among the most basic virtues included in the realm of desire, only those
which one had from birth can be lost--never those which have been acquired
by applying some efforts in practice. This is because these latter types of
virtue are gone by the time the mistaken views involved have even reached a
minor stage of minor intensity. They have been lost because the hold retaining
them was lost.

LOG LTA YANG RGYU DANG 'BRAS BU LA SKUR BA 'DEBS PAS GCOD KYI, 'PHAGS PA LA SKUR BA 'DEBS PAS GCOD PA MIN NO,
As for the type of mistaken view involved, a person loses his most basic virtue
through the one denying the principles of cause and effect. It is not however

the view that realized beings do not exist which causes one to lose his most
basic virtues.

,BAG MED DANG BSKAL BA MI MNYAM PAS GCOD PA MIN ZER YANG , SKAL BA MNYAM MI MNYAM ZAG BCAS ZAG MED LA DMIGS PA KUN GYIS GCOD PAR BYED,
Now some make the claim that views involving unstained phenomena or levels
which are not comparable cannot cause a person to lose his most basic virtues.
The fact though is that this virtue can be lost through all the forms of this
view: through those that focus on levels that are comparable or those which are
not; through those that focus on unstained phenomena or on those with stain.
 JI LTAR NA, KHA CIG, MTHONG LAM GYIS MTHONG SPANG SPONG BA LTAR CIG CAR GCOD ZER YANG , SGOM SPANG SPONG BA LTAR RIMS KYIS GCOD PAR BYED DO,
How exactly does the loss occur? Some claim that a person loses his most
basic virtue all at once, the same way he loses all the undesirable objects that
the path of seeing eliminates, once he gains this path. What actually happens
though is that the virtue is lost in stages, the same way one loses the
undesirable objects eliminated by the path of habituation.

,RTEN GANG LA GCOD CE NA, GLING GSUM GYI MI'I NANG DU GCOD KYI, GZHAN RNAMS SU MI GCOD DE, NGAN SONG BA RNAMS SHES RAB NYON MONGS PA CAN MI BRTAN PA'I PHYIR DANG , BYANG SGRA MI SNYAN PA SDIG PA'I BSAM PA MI BRTAN PA'I PHYIR DANG , 'DOD GZUGS KYI LHA NI GNAS GSUM MNGON DU GYUR PA YIN PAS, SKYES MA THAG TU LAS 'BRAS MNGON DU GYUR PA'I PHYIR,
One may next ask what kind of being can lose his basic virtue. Such a loss can
occur among humans of the three continents, but not among other types of
beings. The afflicted mental capacity of hell beings lacks the necessary
stability, and the same lack of stability characterizes the non-virtuous thoughts
of humans on the continent of Terrible Sound. Pleasure beings in the realms
of desire and form are beings who see the three conditions directly; the
principles of cause and effect are evident to them therefore, just after their
birth.

MI YANG SKYES PA DANG BUD MED KYIS GCOD KYI, ZA MA DANG MA NING GIS MI GCOD DE, SDIG PA'I BSAM PA MI BRTAN PA'I PHYIR,
Even among humans, basic virtue is lost by those who are male or female--not
by those who have lost their sexual organ, or who never had one. This is
because non-virtuous thoughts in the minds of such beings are never very
stable.

MI LA LTA BA SPYAD BA DANG SRED PA SPYAD PA GNYIS KYI NANG NAS SNGA MA DE LA GCOD PAR BYED DE, SHES RAB NYON MONGS PA CAN BRTAN PA'I PHYIR,
Humans in general can be divided into two types: the more intellectual, and
the more sensual. It is the former of the two that can lose this virtue, for they
are capable of sustained intellectual activity marred by mental afflictions.

DGE RTZA CHAD PA DE'I NGO BO NI DGE RTZA DANG MI LDAN PA'O,
The basic nature of this loss or what we call "cut-off" of a person's most basic
virtue is simply not to have it.
44
How Most Basic Virtue is Regained

,MTSAMS NI THE TSOM YOD LTA BAS,
,MTSAMS MED BYED PA'I 'DI LA MIN,
Regained by suspecting, view there are;
Not in this, when immediate's done.
[IV.319-20]

"What," one may ask, "can help a person regain his most basic virtue after he
has lost it?" This virtue can first be regained simply by suspecting that the
principles regarding deeds and their results may actually exist. It can also be
regained by gaining the correct view, whereby one actually perceives that there
really are such principles.

DGE RTZA CHAD PA DE TSE 'DI LA MTSAMS SBYOR BAR NGES SAM ZHE NA, MTSAMS MED BYED PA'I TSE 'DI LA SBYOR BA MIN NO,
One may ask whether it is always certain that a person will be able to regain
his most basic virtue in the same life that he lost it. The answer is that he does
not regain the virtue in this same life when he has done any of the
"immediate" type of wrong deeds.

,DUS NAM GYI TSE SBYOR ZHE NA, SNGON RGYU'I STOBS KYIS DGE RTZA CHAD NA DMYAL BA NAS 'CHI 'PHO BA'I TSE SBYOR, RKYEN GYI STOBS KYIS DGE RTZA CHAD NA DMYAL BAR SKYES PA'I TSE MTSAMS SBYOR BA YIN NO,
"When then," one may ask, "does such a person regain his basic virtue?" If he
originally lost this virtue because of some main cause, then the person regains
it once he dies and migrates out of his hell birth. If on the other hand it was
only some secondary factor that made him lose the virtue, then he regains it
when he takes his hell birth.
45
The Projecting Energy of Deeds

,GCIG GIS SKYE BA GCIG 'PHEN TO,
A single one projects a single birth.
[IV.377]

Does a single deed project but a single birth, or many different births? And
do a number of deeds project a number of births, or just a single birth? The
answer is that a single deed projects a single birth; it cannot project a number
of births. And since they would function to project a whole group of similar
births, a number of deeds on the other hand is never something that projects
but a single birth. This by the way is all the Detailist system.

,'O NA RGYAL PO DANG YANG DAG PAR LDAN PA'I MDO LAS,
Now someone may object that this description contradicts the following
quotation from the Sutra of Sovereignty--

GNAS BRTAN MA 'GAGS PAS DGE SLONG RNAMS LA SMRAS PA, TSE DANG LDAN PA DAG BDAG WA RA nA SIR SKYES BU DBUL PO RTZVA 'THU BA ZHIG TU GYUR PA NA, RANG SANGS RGYAS STENG GNAS BSAM SHES BYA BA'AM, SPYI GTZUG ME TOG TA KAR LTA BU ZHES BYA BA LA BSOD SNYOMS PHUL TE,
The elder, Aniruddha, spoke to the monks as follows:
"Venerable monks, I once took a birth in Varanasi, as a poor man
whose job it was to collect straw for use as fuel. The poor man
made the traditional offerings of food to a Self-Made Buddha by
the name of Tengnesam [?], who was also known as `the one
with the top center part of his head protruding like a takar
flower.'

BDAG GI BSOD SNYOMS GCIG PO DE'I RNAM PAR SMIN PAS LEN BDUN GYI BAR DU SUM CU RTZA GSUM PA'I LHA RNAMS KYI NANG DU SKYES SHING , LAN BDUN GYI BAR DU 'KHOR LOS SGYUR BA'I RGYAL POR GYUR PA NAS, DA LTA SH'AKYA PHYUG PO'I RIGS SU SKYES PA'I BAR DU YIN NO, , ZHES GSUNGS PA DANG 'GAL LO ZHE NA,
"My one act of giving away these offerings ripened into a birth
as a pleasure being in the Land of the Thirty-Three. I was born
there a total of seven times, and then took another seven births
as a Wheel Emperor. And still it continues now, with my present
birth into the wealthier class of the Shakyas."

Yet there is no contradiction: the process was as follows. His offerings brought
the poor man the good fortunes of a happier birth; later, he recalled what had
brought him this state. These recollections themselves brought him still further
merit. Thus although we can say that the one act of merit brought him such
and such different births, what we really mean is that he achieved these births
through a process that began with the one act. It's like saying "I got rich on
a single dong-tse [an amount of money]" when what you really did was start
with a single dong-tse and turn it over in a great many business deals until
eventually you became wealthy.

,YANG NA BSOD SNYOMS GCIG PHUL BA DE LA BRTEN NAS DGA' BA DANG YID RANG PA LA SOGS PA'I SEMS PA'I LAS DU MA YOD PA'I PHYIR DE DAG GI 'BRAS BU YIN NO,
You could also say that the poor man started with the one instance of offering
food and that it caused numerous instances of gladness and rejoicing over the
act; these are themselves deeds consisting of a movement of the mind, and the
many births can be said to have resulted from them.
46
The Finishing Energy of Deeds

,YONGS RDZOGS BYED PA DU MA YIN,
Those that act to finish them off are many.
[IV.378]

,LAS GCIG GIS 'PHANGS PA'I RIS MTHUN PA'I SKYE BA DE'I KHYAD PAR GYI CHOS YONGS SU RDZOGS PAR BYED PA'I LAS NI DU MA YIN TE, DPER NA, RI MO MKHAN MKHAS PAS SKYA RIS RI LU GCIG GIS BYAS NAS, GZHAN RNAMS KYIS TSON SNA TSOGS KYIS RDZOGS PAR BYED PA LTAR,
It is but a single energy of deeds that projects a birth having a nature
consistent with the deed; those deeds though that act to finish off the finer
details of this future life are many. A master painter for example can sketch
out the canvas with a single piece of chalk, and then a number of other people
can come and fill it in with various different colors.

Any given group of people is similar in being human, but some of them
who've had the details of their lives finished by virtuous deeds will have more
attractive bodies, all their senses complete, greater material wealth, freedom
from illness, positions of greater authority, and so on. Others in the same
group who've had the details of their lives finished by non-virtuous deeds will
have bodies with a repulsive appearance and so on.

Thus we can say that all four combinations between the two are possible:
projection of a life by virtue but finishing by non-virtue, the reverse, a case
where both are virtue, and a case where both are non-virtue. An example of
the first would be persons born as pleasure beings or humans but who
possessed certain sufferings.

An illustration of the second would be either the "Lord of All Things"--the
Lord of Death--or the kings of the serpent-like nagas, those like the "Prince of
Opulence." An example of the third combination would be "Hundred
Offerings"--lord of the great pleasure beings. And a case of the final
combination would be the beings in the lowest hell, known as "No Respite."

The Sutrists and others assert though that there are many explanations, in a
number of different sutras, that a single deed can project multiple rebirths.
Therefore, they say, a single deed can project many births and a number of
deeds can as well project a single birth.

Split community, a thing without a

Not afflicted, neither specified,
Something the community possesses.
The disapproved that leads to it's a lie;
This the one who made the schism has.
[IV.389-394]

MTSAMS MED PA LNGA PO DE DAG LAS DANG PO GSUM SROG GCOD PA DANG , LNGA PA SROG GCOD PA'I SBYOR BA YIN PAS LUS KYI LAS DANG , BZHI PA RDZUN YIN PAS NGAG GI LAS SO,
The first three of the five "immediate" misdeeds mentioned above are different
types of killing, and the fifth is a preliminary to killing. These are, therefore,
deeds of the body. The fourth of the immediate misdeeds is a kind of lie, and
therefore a deed of speech.

Now a split in the community of monks, at least according to the Detailist
system, is said to "exist as a distinct entity--it is a thing (one of the factors)
without involvement in a mental link; its basic nature is for the two factions
of the community of monks to be still unreconciled.

Such a split can also belong to both those who have eliminated their mental
afflictions and those who have lost even their most basic virtue; the nature of
the split is thus such that it is not afflicted, but neither was it specified as
being virtue. We can therefore say that it is ethically neutral, without acting
as an obstacle.

The kind of schism described here is something the community of monks on
both the opposing sides possesses. It is not though the "immediate" misdeed
itself. The disapproved deed that leads to the community's division--its
cause--is a lie that functions to split the community up.

DGE 'DUN 'BYED PAR BYED PA'I RDZUN TE DE NI MTSAMS MED YIN LA, DE NI DGE 'DUN 'BYED PAR BYED PA PO LHAS BYIN LA SOGS PA DANG YANG DAG PAR LDAN NO,
It is the lie which constitutes the immediate misdeed, and this the one who
made the schism in the community has--whether it be Devadatta or someone
else.

The Consequences of Immediate Misdeeds

"Into what kind of consequence," one may ask, "does the immediate misdeed
of dividing the community ripen?" It ripens into suffering, for the person who
committed it, within the hell known as "Without Respite." He must endure
this suffering for the length of an intermediate eon.

,'O NA MTSAMS MED LHAG MA RNAMS BYAS PAS JI LTAR ZHE NA, MTSAM MED GZHAN DAG GIS NI SPYIR DMYAL BAR SKYE BAR NGES KYANG MNAR MED KHO NAR SKYE BAR NI MA NGES SO,
"And what happens," one might continue, "when a person commits any of the
remaining immediate misdeeds?" Committing any of these other immediate
misdeeds is certain to lead one to a birth in the hells, but in a more specific
sense it is not a definite thing that they will always bring a birth in the hell
Without Respite.

One might next pose the following question:
Suppose a person commits two, or even more, of the "immediate"
misdeeds. If he takes only one birth in the hells, then you would
have to say that committing several of these deeds is no more
serious than committing only one. If on the other hand he takes
two or however many births in the hells, you can no longer say
that these deeds give "immediate" results, and that their results
are invariably experienced in the very next life.

The Detailists respond with the following claim:
A person takes no more than a single birth in the hells as a result
of committing "extra ones"--that is two, three, or even more
immediate misdeeds. His body there in the hell of "Without
Respite" though is twice the normal size (or more, according to
the number of such deeds committed), and much more sensitive.
He therefore feels an extra amount of pain: his torment increases
in multiples the same way as his size. This frees us of both the
problems you raised; incidentally, the earlier of the deeds is the
one that projects the birth and the later one (or ones) finishes the
details.

,MDO SDE PA LA SOGS PA NI, MTSAMS MED MANG PO BYAS PAS MNAR MED PAR YANG DANG YANG DU SKYE YANG , LAS BYED PA'I LUS DE DANG DMYAL BA'I BAR DU SKYE BA GZHAN GYIS MTSAMS MED PA'I PHYIR DANG , DE SKYES NAS MYONG 'GYUR DU 'DOD PA LA'ANG BSAL BA MED PA'I PHYIR,
The Sutrists and others though explain the point as follows:
If a person commits a number of immediate misdeeds, he is born
into the hell of torment Without Respite again and again. There
is though no other type of birth taken between the body in which
the deed was done and the body of the hellbeing, so the result is
still "immediate." The idea that the result must be experienced
in the very next life cannot be substantiated.
49
The Details of a Schism

,DGE SLONG LTA SPYAD TSUL LDAN PAS,
,'BYED DO GZHAN DU'O BYIS PA RNAMS,
The schism's made by an intellectual,
Full monk with his morals, elsewhere, children.

What kind of person causes the split? The schism is made by someone who
is a full monk and an intellectual type with all his morals. The person in
question cannot be a layman, or the type more inclined to sensual pleasures,
or someone who has lost his morals. This is because, first of all, he is vying
with the Buddha. Secondly, he must have a very sharp mind. Finally, the
community of monks would lend no credence to such types.

,GANG DU ZHE NA, SANGS RGYAS BZHUGS PA'I GNAS DE LAS GZHAN DU YIN GYI, STON PA'I MNGON SUM DU NI MA YIN TE, SANGS RGYAS KYI GZI BRJID MI BZOD PA'I PHYIR RO, , GANG 'BYED NA, BYIS PA SO SO SKYE BO'I DGE 'DUN RNAMS 'BYED KYI, 'PHAGS PA RNAMS NI MA YIN TE, CHOS NYID MNGON SUM DU GYUR PA LAS SANGS RGYAS LA SHES NAS DAD PA THOB PA'I PHYIR,
Where does the split occur? It must take place "elsewhere"--that is, in some
location other than where the Buddha himself is residing. It could never occur
in the direct presence of the Buddha, since his overwhelming glory would
never permit it. And who is it that gets split off? It is only "children"--that
is to say, common beings [which refers to those who have yet to see
selflessness directly]--among the community of monks who are estranged.
Realized beings cannot be led into a schism, for they possess a faith in the
Buddha born from knowledge: they have perceived Reality directly.

One may ask at what point a schism is considered to have occurred. The
community of monks is considered split at that point when, first of all, there
is an acceptance of some Teacher (namely, Devadatta) other than the Buddha
himself. Secondly, this is the point where there is an acceptance and attempt
to practice some path other than that enunciated by the Buddha. This
opposing path consists of the "Five Rules" set forth by Devadatta for attaining
freedom from the world:
1) giving up the use of curds;
2) giving up meat;
3) giving up salt;
4) giving up the traditional patchwork robes; and
5) staying in temples inside of towns.

A division of the community of monks is accepted as a breaking of the wheel
of the teachings, for no new paths start up in the minds of anyone at all until
the estranged monks are reconciled. What we've described here is the
immediate misdeed of a schism in the community; other types of divisions are
possible, but do not constitute the "immediate" type of deed.

The break in the wheel described above occurs on Dzambu Continent (as this
is where the Buddha resides), but not on the others. As for the individuals
involved, the deed can only be accomplished with nine "or such" (meaning "or
more") full monks. This is because it takes at least four monks to make what
we call a "community" of monks; there have to be two such groups created,
along with one person who incites the schism--and he too must definitely be
a full monk. This of course represents the bare minimum--there is no
certainty that a great many more individuals might not be involved in such a
schism.

Now what we call a "split in the activities" of the community can occur on
three different continents--that is, on any one where the teachings exist, which
would eliminate only the northern continent of Terrible Sound. This type of
schism occurs only within the confines of a single physical monastic institution,
and where the required rites of the monastic confession and so on have been
performed with unity up to that point.

,GANG ZAG DUS ZHE NA, LAS KYI DBYEN DE NI 'BYED PA PO GZHAN MI DGOS PAS, DGE SLONG BRGYAD YAN CHAD KYIS 'GRUB BO,
How many individuals are required for this type of schism? A split in the
activities of the community requires no separate person to incite the division,
so the deed can be accomplished with the involvement of eight or more full
monks.

Now a breaking of the wheel of the teachings as described above never occurs
at "the beginning"--that is, during the period just after the Buddha has first
set this wheel in motion. This is because at this point everyone shares a
peculiar sense of unity, a perfect harmony born of communal joy.

Neither does the break ever occur at the end of the Buddha's precious
life--when he passes into his final nirvana. This is because his followers at
this point share exactly the same thoughts: a special awareness of how rare the
Buddha is, and strong feelings of resignation with life once its impermanence
has been drawn to their attention then.

This means that a schism in the community will furthermore never happen
before certain faults occur--faults in the way that followers view the teachings
and maintain their morality. For until such time, the teachings themselves
remain without defect.

Furthermore, no division can occur before the appearance of one or another
of The Great Pair. This is because the division is of very brief duration and
could not otherwise be brought to an end, since the reconciliation is always
performed by one of these two.

THUB PA NONGS PA STE MYA NGAN LAS 'DAS PA'I 'OG TU'ANG MI 'BYUNG STE, GANG LA 'GRAN PA'I SANGS RGYAS MI BZHUGS PA'I PHYIR,
No schism can occur after The Able One himself passes on (that is, subsequent
to his final nirvana), since there is then no Buddha present for the leader of the
schism to compete with.

Finally, no division of the community can occur until such time as different
monastic residences, both large and small, are set apart from each other. This
is because divisions between the community of monks that occur within a
single monastic institution do not qualify as a breaking of the wheel, although
they are a type of schism. In summary then we can say that there are six
periods during which it is impossible for a break in the wheel of the teachings
to occur.

Now this schism is something that depends upon the past deeds of the
disciples involved, so does not occur with every single Buddha. The
explanation goes that, in a former birth as a bodhisattva, our own Teacher (the
Leader of the Shakyas) created a schism among the followers of a certain great
adept who possessed the five types of supernormal powers: the present schism
is just the eventual ripening of this misdeed. According to the teachings for
those of higher capacity though this description is not to be taken literally.

What Makes Deeds Immediate

,PHAN 'DOGS PA DANG YON TAN ZHING ,

As objects of assistance, qualities,
Since you reject and also eliminate them.

One may ask the following: "Why is it considered an `immediate' misdeed only
when a person performs one of the actions such as killing his father or mother?
Why isn't it the same kind of deed when a person commits an act, such as the
killing, towards someone else?" The answer is that killing one's father or
mother is an "immediate" misdeed as they are very special objects, due to the
great assistance they have rendered one: they have given you a body, a body
with which you can attain freedom. And by thinking to kill them you reject
them; by actually undertaking the deed, you also eliminate them.

The case with enemy destroyers, the community of monks, and Buddhas is
similar. They are objects possessed of exceptional qualities; by thinking to do
the particular deed towards them you reject them, and by actually undertaking
the various deeds involved you create conditions which are not at all
conducive to their continued life.

DE BZHIN GSHEGS PA DKRONG BAR MA NUS KYANG BSAM PAS SPANGS PA'I PHYIR RO, , LAS GZHAN DAG LA NI DE LTA BU'I NYES PA CHE BA MED PA'I PHYIR, MTSAMS MED DU MI 'GYUR RO,
Here we should mention that, although it is impossible for anyone to actually
kill a Buddha, the thought to do so is a rejection of the Buddha. Kinds of
actions other than those described above are in no way as serious, so are not
counted among the "immediate" misdeeds.

Clarification of Certain Immediate Misdeeds

It is, even should the organ switch.
Mother, the one whose menses he came from.
[IV.411-12]

One might ask the following question: "Suppose a person kills a father or
mother whose sexual organ has changed. Is it still an `immediate' misdeed?"
Even should the sexual organ of one's father or mother switch (and they thus
become a female or a male, respectively), it is still the "immediate" deed of
patricide or matricide if he kills them. This is because one has still killed the
person who performed the function of a father or mother: the one who
endowed him with his very special body.

GAL TE BUD MED GZHAN GYI NUR NUR PO, , GZHAN GYI MNGAL DU BLUG NAS DE'I MNGAL DU BSKYED NA, BUD MED GNYIS PO DE LAS GANG BSAD NA MTSAMS MED DU 'GYUR ZHE NA, GNYIS PO DE LAS BUD MED DANG PO GANG GI ZLA MTSAN LAS BYUNG BA DE NYID DE'I MA YIN PAS, BUD MED DANG PO DE BSAD NA 'GYUR TE, THAR PA DAR MTHUN PA'I LUS DE SKYED PA'I GTZO BO YIN PA'I PHYIR,
One may then pose another question: "Suppose the embryo in one woman's
body is removed and placed in the womb of another, and the child takes birth
from this woman's womb. Killing which of these two women would constitute

the `immediate' misdeed?" The mother of the person in question is the former
of the two women: the one whose menses he came from. Therefore killing
this first woman would be the immediate misdeed; she played the principal
role in providing the person a body fit for gaining freedom. We could not
consider the second woman, the woman who kept the child in her womb, the
child's mother--this act alone would not make hers the principal role.

Now it is not an "immediate" misdeed if a person undertakes to kill his father
or mother and ends up killing someone else; nor is it if one undertakes to kill
someone else and ends up killing one of his parents. This is because, with an
"immediate" misdeed, the actual commission of the act must be concluded with
the same person towards whom the act was undertaken. And this is true of
neither of the cases mentioned. Similar examples would be where the person
killed his mother by accident as she hid under his bed, or where the son of the
washerman threw a rock to kill a fly and smashed his father's skull instead.

Suppose that a person, in the single blow of some weapon, kills his mother and
some other living being. The non-communicating form here consists of both
deeds: the "immediate" misdeed and a simple act of killing. The
communicating form though is subsumed only by the immediate deed, since
an immediate deed possesses such tremendous force.

Next let's take a case where a person kills his father, a father who happens to
be an enemy destroyer as well. Or suppose he kills a person who is both his
mother and an enemy destroyer too. Here he commits a single "immediate"
misdeed, that of killing an enemy destroyer--for only the single physical base
of a person was involved.

One may ask how then we reconcile this position with the following message,
quoted in Divisions of the Word:
In days gone by there was a king of Rauruka City by the name
of Udrayana. He was murdered by his son Shikhandi, who thus
killed a person who was both his father and an enemy destroyer.
The King's last words to the assassins sent by his son were
"Return and tell Shikhandi for me, `You have now committed
two immediate misdeeds--that of killing your father, and that of
killing an enemy destroyer.'"

DE NI KHYOD KYIS RGYU GNYIS KYIS MTSAMS MED PA BYAS TE ZHES PA'AM, YANG NA SGO GNYIS NAS SPYOS PA YIN GYIS, MTSAMS MED DE NI GCIG LAS MED DO,
The point of the king's words was to tell his son that he had on two accounts
committed an immediate misdeed, or that he had committed the deed in two
different ways. There was though no more than one immediate misdeed done.

Let's next consider the immediate misdeed of striking and drawing blood, with
evil intent, from the One Thus Gone. It's considered the immediate misdeed
when a person uses his weapon with the intent to kill the Buddha, but it is not
considered this type of misdeed when a person uses his weapon simply with
a mind to strike the Buddha. This is because such a person lacks the "intent"
stage for an act of taking life.
Suppose for a similar example that someone uses a weapon against a person
who has yet to reach the stage of "enemy destroyer," and then at some point
after the attack the victim does attain this level. Suppose further that our new
enemy destroyer then dies as a result of wounds incurred in the original attack.
It is not considered the immediate misdeed with such a person, for his attacker
did not undertake the action against someone who was an enemy destroyer.

One may pose the following question: "Suppose a person undertakes to commit
an immediate misdeed. Is it possible for such a person--without abandoning
this course of action--to achieve the state where he is free of desire, or to gain
one of the results?" The answer is that it is impossible for one who has
undertaken an immediate misdeed to gain either the level where he is freed
from desire or one of the results. The two states of mind are completely
contradictory.

One may ask, "Which of all these immediate misdeeds is the most serious?"
Lying in order to divide the community of monks into two parts is accepted
as the most heinous of misdeeds among all the immediate. This is because
a person has thereby struck a blow to what is known as the "reality body" of
the One Thus Gone. And as long as the community remains unreconciled,
there is a general stop in the world to certain great virtuous deeds: no one
finds the true certainty, no one achieves the results, no one gains freedom from
desire, and no one brings an end to all stains.

Moreover, such a division prevents persons from engaging in meditative
concentration, and from reading scripture--from daily recitations and from
contemplations. This then interrupts progress in gaining both higher births
and the states of nirvana and Buddhahood. All the inhabitants of the world,
on up to the great pleasure beings, are thrown into turmoil--they lose their
happiness, they lose their freedom, they lose their ability to think. And the
perpetrator must take his birth in the lowest hell, Without Respite, for an eon.
These are what make this deed the worst.

The next most grave of the immediate misdeeds is the fifth; then come the
third, the first, and second--in that order. Thus the murder of one's father is
explained as the least serious of the five.

One may object that this description contradicts the statement in sutra that, of
all the three types of wrong, the three deeds of thought are most serious and
that--within these three--holding mistaken views is most grave. There is
though no inconsistency here. The misdeed we've described leads one to the
hell "Without Respite" for a full intermediate eon; from the viewpoint of the
magnitude of the result that ripens from the deed, we can say that dividing the
community is the most serious of all the immediate misdeeds.

One the other hand there is the case where the raw emotion of fury in the
mind of the great adept brought death to the many individuals of Dantaka
Monastery and other places; we can say then that, with respect to the general
result of death among the populace, actions of the thought are the most
powerful among three groups of deeds that relate to the three passageways.

And with respect to the "creative" result of losing one's most basic virtue,
mistaken views would be the most serious of the deeds of the thought, for the
others in this group lack the power to make one lose this virtue. To express
it in a different way, we can say that each was stated to be the most serious:
dividing the community, deeds of the thought, and holding mistaken
views--but only with the respective assumptions that one is limiting himself
to the five immediate deeds, deeds of the three passageways, or the five views.

The Meritorious Act of Giving

Out of a wish to honor or to aid.

Now among these three, giving is described as follows. It is when any person,
with thoughts of virtue, acts to give any thing he owns to someone else. As
we read in A Sutra Taught at the Request of Vyasa, a Great Adept: "Oh great
adept, all acts of giving even the smallest thing from faith are Giving."

As for the motivation involved, it is only the meritorious act of giving when
one gives away the thing either out of a wish to honor (some very high object)
or out of a wish to aid (some very miserable object). It is not real giving when
one does so only out of fear, or out of hopes of getting something in return,
and so on.

,LAS DE YANG LUS DANG NGAG GI LAS KUN NAS SLONG BA MTSUNGS LDAN DANG BCAS PA YIN NO, , SBYIN PA DE'I 'BRAS BU NI GNAS SKABS SU LONGS SPYOD CHEN PO CAN NO,
Giving moreover consists of deeds of body and speech along with their
motivation and what is linked with it mentally. The result of the giving is the
possession of great wealth, at least for the time being.

As for the different divisions of giving, the first is that giving which benefits
oneself. This would be for a person who had not yet freed himself from desire
for desire-realm objects, or for a common person who had done so but through
the "path of the world," to make offerings to a shrine.

Giving that benefits the other would be any act of giving performed by a
realized person free of desire towards another living being not so freed. This
assumes by the way that we do not consider any results that the former
individual will experience in this same life.

,GNYIS KA'I DON GYI PHYIR SBYIN PA NI 'PHAGS PA 'DOD CHAGS DANG MA BRAL BA'AM, SO SO SKYE BO 'DOD CHAGS DANG MA BRAL BAS, 'DOD CHAGS DANG MA BRAL BA'I SEMS CAN GZHAN LA SBYIN PA'O,
Giving that benefits both would be for a realized being who was not yet free
of desire, or for a common being who was not thus free, to present something
to another living being who was not yet free from desire either.

Giving that benefits neither would be for a realized being who was free of
desire for the desire realm to make offerings to a shrine. This is because the
only point of the offering is for this being to express his deep respect and
gratitude. Here again incidentally we are not counting any results of the
offering that he will achieve in the same life.

Very exceptional types of "it"--of this giving, come from exceptional kinds of
givers, exceptional kinds of things which are given, and exceptional kinds of
objects to whom the things are given. Of these, the giver is made exceptional
through a motivation of faith and "the rest"--which refers first of all to the
rest of the "seven riches of realized beings": morality, generosity, learning, a
sense of shame, a conscience, and wisdom. The phrase also refers to having
little desire for things.

As for how he undertakes the act, the exceptional giver performs his giving
(1) with an attitude of respect and "the like." These last words refer to
handing the object to the other person with one's own hands; (2) giving
something when it is really needed; and (3) performing the actual deed in a
way that does no harm to anyone else. Examples would be where one had
stolen the object from someone else in the first place, or where one presented
a sheep to a butcher. Included here too are cases where the object given hurt
the recipient--examples would be giving someone poison or unhealthy food.

Concerning the consequences of such giving, the person has performed his
charity with an attitude of respect and so on, as listed above. As a result he
gains the following (and here the list follows the three numbers above). In his
future life he wins (1) the honor and respect of those who follow him, as well
as a wealth of material things (which because of his former faith he enjoys at
his total discretion). In this next life he also gains (2) the timely fulfillment of
his own needs, as well as (3) complete freedom from any hindrances to his
wealth: enemies, loss of his things in a fire, and so on.

From "it" (that is, from giving things with an excellent color), one gains an
excellent bodily form--at least for the time being. Temporarily too he gains
other results (following the order of the qualities just listed): a good and
widespread reputation; great happiness; and a body with a very youthful
complexion. The body that one possesses is moreover like that which belongs
to the "jewel of the queen": it is pleasant to touch in each of the
times--whether the temperature is just normal, or whether it is cold (when the
queen's body gives you warmth), or hot (at which time the queen feels to you
cool).

To the sick, a spiritual teacher, or
A bodhisattva in his final life

Those to whom you give a gift can be exceptional by virtue of four different
reasons, first by the type of being involved. As Gautami's Sutra states,
Ananda, you can look forward to a hundredfold result ripening
back to you, if you give something to an individual who has
reached the animal's state of birth. But you can look forward to
a thousandfold result if you give something even to a human
who's immoral.

The object towards whom you perform your giving may also be distinguished
by his suffering. Suppose for example that you take all the things that a

person can give in one of those types of acts where the merit derives from a
substantial thing. It is stated that if you give these things to a sick person, or
to someone nursing a sick person, or to someone when it's cold outside or
whatever, the merit is immeasurable.

PHA MA DANG PHAN 'DOGS PA GZHAN YANG RUNG STE, DOM DANG RI DAGS RU RU LA SOGS PA'I SKYES RABS LTA BU RANG LA PHAN 'DOGS PA DANG ,
The recipient may furthermore be distinguished by the aid he has given one
in the past. Here we include one's father and mother, or anyone else who has
been of special help to one. Examples may be found among stories of the
Buddha's former lives, such as the one about the bear and the ru-ru deer.

The person to whom one gives his gift may, lastly, be exceptional by virtue of
his good qualities. Gautami's Sutra provides some examples:
If you give to someone who has kept his morality, you can expect
it to ripen into a result a hundred thousand times as great. If
you give to someone who has entered that stage known as the
"result of entering the stream," it ripens into something which is
immeasurable. And if you give even more to someone who has
entered the stream, the result is even more immeasurable.

CHAGS BRAL LA CHAGS BRAL BAS, BYIN NA ZANG ZING SBYIN PA'I MCHOG, CES GSUNGS SO,
Now the highest kind of giving is for someone who has freed himself of the
three realms to give something to someone else who has freed himself as well.
This is because both are the highest kind of individual. Again we see, in
Gautami's Sutra,
The highest form of giving a physical thing
Is by one free to another free of desire:
But one with his body and speech restrained,
Reaching out his hand to offer food.

We can also though take a giver who is a bodhisattva and who gives any
object at all, for the sake of helping every being alive. Although this is an act
of giving by a person who is not yet freed and is directed to another person
not yet freed, it is still the highest kind of giving. This is because the act has
been performed for the sake of total enlightenment and every living being.
And this is because one has given something in order to become the savior of
every single being.

Now a certain sutra gives the following list of eight types of giving:
1) Giving to close ones;
2) Giving out of fear;
3) Giving because they gave to you;
4) Giving because they will give to you;
5) Giving because one's parents and ancestors used to give;
6) Giving with the hope of attaining one of the higher births;
7) Giving to gain fame;
8) Giving to gain the jewel of the mind, to gain the riches of the mind,
to win what great practitioners collect together, to achieve the
ultimate goal.

,ZHES SBYIN PA BRGYAD GSUNGS PA'I NANG NAS NI BRGYAD PA SEMS KYI RGYAN LA SOGS PA'I PHYIR SBYIN PA MCHOG 
We can alternately describe the highest type of giving as the eighth in this list:
giving to gain the jewel of the mind and so on.

As for the meaning of the expression "giving to close ones," certain masters of
the past have claimed that it refers to giving to someone when they are
standing close by, or to someone when they approach close by. "Giving out
of fear" means that a person decides he will give the best he has, but only
because he perceives some great imminent danger to himself. And "giving
because they gave to you" refers to giving something to a person with the
thought that "I'm doing this because he gave me something before."

The remaining members of the list are easily understood. "Jewel of the mind"
refers to the ability to perform miracles, while "riches of the mind" refers to the
eight parts of the path of realized beings. "What great practitioners collect
together" refers to perfectly tranquil concentration and special realization. The
"ultimate goal" can be described as achieving the state of an enemy destroyer,
or the state of nirvana. This is how the Master Jinaputra explains the various
types of giving.

Master Purna explains them as follows:
Giving to gain the "jewel of the mind" and the rest of the four
refers respectively to (1) that which brings one the riches of faith
and the rest; (2) that which is totally inconsistent with the stink
of stinginess; (3) that which makes the happiness of balanced
meditation grow; and (4) that which brings on the state of
nirvana.

These four have also been accepted as relating respectively to the four "results
of the way of virtue," or to (1) the paths of collection and preparation, (2) the
path of seeing, (3) the path of habituation, and (4) nirvana. An alternate way
is to correlate them with (1) the paths of collection and preparation, (2) the
seven impure levels, (3) the three pure levels, and (4) the level of a Buddha.

Beyond the above, we can say that there are other acts of giving where, even
though the recipient is not a realized being, the resulting merit still cannot be
measured in units such as a "hundred thousand times greater" or such. These
would involve gifts made to one's father or mother (recipients who had given
one great aid), to the sick (recipients who are in a state of suffering), to a
spiritual teacher, or to a bodhisattva in his final life.

Support for this description can be found in the Sutra on Causes and Effect of
Right and Wrong, which equates the merit of giving to these objects with the
amount of merit you collect from giving something to the Buddha himself:
Moreover, the act of giving performed towards any one of the
three different kinds of individuals ripens into a result which
never reaches an end at all. These objects are the One Thus
Gone, a person's parents, and the sick.

The Severity of Deeds according to Six Factors

,MJUG DANG ZHING DANG GZHI DANG NI,
,SBYOR DANG SEMS PA BSAM PA STE,
,DE DAG CHUNG DANG CHE BA LAS,
,LAS KYANG CHUNG DANG CHE BA NYID,
Conclusion, one who's acted toward, commission;
Undertaking, thinking, and intention:
The power of the deed itself's exactly
As little or great as these happen to be.
[IV.473-6]

,ZHAR LA CI YANG BSHAD PA NI, MJUG TU BYED PAS CHE BA NI LAS KYI LAM DNGOS KYI RJES LA RGYUN TU BYED PA DANG ,
Here we might touch by the way on what determines how serious a given
deed will be. The first factor that can make a deed serious is what we call
"performance in conclusion," which means to continue a particular act well
after the original course of action.

ZHING GIS CHE BA NI PHAN 'DOGS PA DANG , GZHIS CHE BA NI LUS KYI LAS LA SROG GCOD PA DANG , NGAG GI LAS LA RDZUN DANG , YID KYI LAS LA LOG LTA CHE BA LA SOGS PA DANG , SROG GCOD PA'ANG CHEN PO NI DGRA BCOM PA GSOD PA LA SOGS PA STE, MNAR MED DU 'GRO BAS SO, , 'BRING NI LAM LA GNAS PA BSAD PA'O, , THA MA NI DUD 'GRO DANG TSUL KHRIMS 'CHAL PA BSOD PA'O, , ZHES DRAN PA NYER GZHAG LAS 'BYUNG NGO ,
The one who's acted toward in any particular deed--someone who may have
lent one great aid in the past--is also a factor in making the deed a serious
one. Deeds which are more serious because of the basic type involved in the
actual commission of the act would include cases like killing (among the
different deeds of the body), lying (among the deeds of speech), and mistaken

views (among the deeds of thought). Even among the different types of killing
there are those which are more serious--killing an enemy destroyer, for
example--because as Close Recollection states,
...it leads one to the lowest hell, "Without Respite." A less serious
type of killing would be to take the life of a person who had
reached any of the paths. And the least serious type would be
to kill an animal, or a very immoral person.

,SBYOR BAS CHE BA NI LUS NGAG GIS DNGOS SU SBYOR BA DANG , SEMS PAS CHE BA NA RDZOGS PAR BYED PA'I SEMS PA CHE BA DANG , BSAM PAS CHE BA NI KUN SLONG GI BSAM PA CHE BA STE,
Deeds made serious by the stage of their preliminary undertaking would be
those which involved actually applying oneself physically or verbally. Deeds
made serious by the thinking involved would be those where one's thoughts
in carrying out the act were particularly strong. And deeds which turn more
serious because of the intention involved would be those where one
undertakes an act with particularly strong thoughts of motivation.

DE LTAR NA MJUG LA SOGS PA DRUG PO DE DAG CHUNG BA DANG CHE BA LAS, LAS KYANG CHUNG BA DANG CHE BAR 'GYUR BA NYID DO, , RNAM PA DRUG KA TSANG NA SHIN TU LCI BA'I LAS SU SHES SO,
We can summarize by saying that the power of the deed itself is exactly as
little or great as these six factors of conclusion and the rest happen to be in
their own force. One should understand that deeds where all six factors are
present in force are extremely serious.
63
Whether Deeds are Collected or Not

A deed is called "collected" from its being
Done intentionally, to its completion,
Without regret, without a counteraction,
With attendants, ripening as well.
[IV.477-80]

,YANG MDO LAS, LAS BYAS LA BSAGS BA DANG , LAS BYAS LA BSAGS PA MIN PA SOGS GSUNGS NA, DE DAG JI LTA BU ZHE NA,
Now sutra also mentions a number of concepts including "deeds which are
done and also collected" as well as "deeds which are done but which are not
collected." One may ask just what these are.

A deed is called "done and also collected" from its being done with six
different conditions, described as follows:
1) The deed must be done intentionally; that is, it cannot have
been performed without premeditation, or simply on the spur of
the moment.
2) It must have been done "to its completion"--meaning with all
the various elements of a complete deed present.
3) The person who committed the deed must feel no regret later
on.
4) There must be no counteraction to work against the force of
the deed.
5) The deed must come along with the necessary attendants.

6) The deed must as well be one of those where one is certain to
experience the ripening of a result in the future.

LAS GZHAN NI BYAS LA BSAGS PA MIN PA'I LAS ZHES BYA'O, , DE BZHIN DU BSAGS LA MA BYAS PA DANG , GNYIS KA MIN PA'ANG SHES PAR BYA'O,
Deeds other than the type described are what we call "done but not collected."
From this one can understand what kinds of deeds are meant by the
expressions "collected but not done" and "neither done nor collected."

,DE LA RDZOGS PA NI LAS KHA CIG NI NYES SPYAD DANG LEGS SPYAD GCIG GIS NGAN 'GRO DANG BDE 'GROR 'GRO LA, KHA CIG NI SGO GSUM GYI LAS BCU CAR GYIS NGAN 'GRO DANG BDE 'GROR 'GRO BA YOD DE, DE NI LAS DAG RDZOGS PAR BYAS PA'O,
As for the phrase "to its completion," in some cases a single act of right or
wrong leads one to a birth in the states of misery or to a birth in the happier
states. In other cases, all ten deeds of all three doors lead a person to the
appropriate one of these two births. In either case the deeds have been done
to their completion.

,GNYEN PO MED PA NI LOG LTA DANG 'GYOD PA LA SOGS PA DANG , BSHAGS PA DANG SDOM PA LA SOGS PA MED PA'O,
The phrase "without a counteraction" refers to deeds done (1) with mistaken
ideas, misgivings, or the like; (2) without confession, future restraint, or such.
 , 'KHOR NI DGE MI DGE'I LAS LA 'KHOR YANG DGE BA DANG MI DGE BA STE, GANG ZHIG BYAS NA RJES SU YI RANG BAR BYED PA'O ZHES t'AI K'AR BSHAD MOD, 'DIR NI 'KHOR SBYOR MJUG GNYIS KA YIN NO,
A deed "along with its necessary attendants" means a deed of virtue or non-
virtue along with attendants of further virtue or non-virtue. Admittedly, the
Commentary does explains these as "Any deed which you rejoice about having
done." Nonetheless the attendants here are the preliminary undertaking and
final conclusion stages of the deed.
