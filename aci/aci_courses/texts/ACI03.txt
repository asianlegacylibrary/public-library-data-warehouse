Course III: Applied Meditation
Readings One and Two: The Six Preliminaries to Meditation,
and the Seven Ingredients
The following selection is taken from the Great Book on the Steps of the Path
(Lam-rim chen-mo) written by Je Tsongkapa (1357-1419). This part of his work
is a commentary on a special prayer called the King of All Prayers, the Prayer of
the Realized One, Deeds of All Goodness.
************

*, , LAM RIM CHEN MO LAS, ,
From the Great Book on the Steps of the Path by Je Tsongkapa:

,SKYONG TSUL MDOR BSDUS TE BSTAN PA LA GNYIS, SKYONG TSUL DNGOS DANG , DE LA LOG RTOG DGAG PA'O, , DANG PO LA GNYIS LAS, THUN GYI NGO BO LA JI LTAR BYA BA LA, DANG PO SBYOR BA'I CHOS NI DRUG STE,
Here we begin a brief presentation of how to practice the steps of the path to
Buddhahood. First we will make the actual presentation, and after that refute
certain mistaken ideas about the steps. The presentation itself comes in two
sections; the first is how to proceed during meditation periods. This starts
with Six Preliminaries to meditation.

1A/GSER GLING PA'I RNAM THAR YIN PAS, GNAS KHANG LEGS PAR BYI DOR BYAS LA SKU GSUNG THUGS KYI RTEN LEGS PAR DGRAM,
[1] Here we are following the descriptions of how Serlingpa practiced during
his life. The first preliminary to meditation is to make the room tidy and clean;
then set up a beautiful altar, with representations of the Buddha's body,
speech, and mind.

2A/MCHOD PA G-YO MED PAR BTZAL LA BKOD PA MDZES PAR BSHAM,
[2] The second preliminary is to go and find offerings that you obtain without
using any dishonest means. Put them forth in an attractive arrangement.

3A/DE NAS NYAN SA LAS GNYID RMUGS KYI SGRIB PA LAS SEMS SBYONG BA'I SKABS SU PHAN TSUN 'CHAG DGOS LA DE LAS GZHAN PA'I 'DOD PA LA 'DUN PA LA SOGS PA'I SGRIB PA RNAMS LAS SEMS SBYONG BA'I TSE KHRI'AM KHRI'U LA SOGS PA'I STENG DU SKYIL MO KRUNG DU 'KHOD NAS BYA BAR GSUNGS PAS, GNAS MAL BDE BA LA LUS DRANG POR BSRANG STE SKYIL MO KRUNG NGAM SKYIL MO KRUNG PHYED DU'ANG RUNG BA'I SPYOD LAM GYIS 'KHOD NAS SKYABS SU 'GRO BA DANG SEMS BSKYED PA RGYUD DANG 'DRES NGES PA ZHIG BYA,
[3] Now the Levels of Listeners [by Master Asanga] says that, when you are
practicing to purify the mind of the obstacles of sleepiness and fogginess, you
should "press them upon each other." It also states that, when you are
practicing to purify the mind of other kinds of obstacles, such as attraction to
the objects of the senses, you should seat yourself upon a platform or smaller
seat and assume the full lotus position. Therefore the third preliminary is to
seat yourself on a comfortable cushion, sit up straight, and assume a full lotus
position with your legs (a half lotus is also acceptable). In this pose then sink
your mind deep into the thoughts of taking refuge, and the wish for
enlightenment.

4A/MDUN GYI NAM MKHA' LA RGYA CHEN SPYOD PA DANG ZAB MO LTA BA'I BRGYUD PA'I BLA MA RNAMS DANG GZHAN YANG SANGS RGYAS DANG BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA' 'PHAGS PA NYAN THOS DANG RANG SANGS RGYAS BKA' SDOD DANG BCAS PA DPAG TU MED PA BZHUGS PAR BSAMS 
TE TSOGS GSOG PA'I ZHING GSAL GDAB,
[4] The fourth preliminary is to visualize the garden for gathering the power
of good. In the space before you, imagine the Lamas of both the far-reaching
lineage, and the lineage of the profound view. Together with them are an
inconceivable mass of Buddhas, and bodhisattvas, listeners, self-made Buddhas,
and protectors of the Dharma.

5A/DE NAS LAM RGYUD LA SKYE BA'I MTHUN RKYEN TSOGS BSAG PA DANG 'GAL RKYEN SGRIB PA SBYONG BA'I LHAN CIG BYED RKYEN MED NA NYER LEN GYI RGYU DMIGS RNAM SKYONG BA TZAM LA 'BAD KYANG LAM SHIN TU SKYE DKA' BAS BSAG SBYANG GI GNAD RNAMS BSDUS PA'I YAN LAG BDUN PAS RGYUD SBYANG DGOS SO,
[5] It is extremely difficult to bring the path to grow within the stream of your
mind if all you practice is the various principal causes. You also need the
supporting causes for the path to grow; you need to gather together the
different factors that are conducive to the path, and you need to clean yourself
of the factors that are obstacles, the ones that oppose the path. Therefore you
must train your mind in the Seven Ingredients, which include in them all the
critical points for gathering good and cleaning away obstacles.

[a] The first ingredient is prostration. There is one kind of prostration that
combines all three doors of expression. It is found in the verse [from the King
of All Prayers, the Prayer of the Realized One, Deeds of All Goodness] that includes
the words "Whosoever they are, as many as there may be." [The full verse
reads:
 , JI SNYED SU DAG PHYOGS BCU'I 'JIG RTEN NA,
,DUS GSUM GSHEGS PA MI YI SENG GE KUN,
,BDAG GIS MA LUS DE DAG THAMS CAD LA,
,LUS DANG NGAG YID DANG BAS PHYAG BGYI'O,
I bow down, and purely,
In body and speech and mind,
To all those Lions of living kind,
Whosoever they are,
As many as there may be,
To those Who are Gone;
Gone in the past,
In the present or the future,
On any of the planets
In the ten directions of space.]
Here we are not talking of a Buddha on a certain planet in a certain direction
of space, nor are we talking of a Buddha of a particular time; our prostrations
rather are directed at each and every Victorious Buddha, those who live in
every one of the ten directions of space itself--those who have already come
before, those who are going to come in the future, and those who now are
here. Don't do your prostrations just to go along with the crowd; do them
rather out of deep respect, from the depths of your heart.
On this the master Yeshe De, in his commentary, notes that "The good deed
you do by prostrating to a single Buddha is beyond any means of measuring.
So there's no need to mention what a goodness it is to picture this many
Buddhas, and then prostrate yourself to them."

This is how we explain what it is to prostrate through each one of the three
doors of expression. The first is the prostration in body, and is found in the
one verse that includes the lines "Deeds of Goodness" [The full verse reads:

,BZANG PO SPYOD PA'I SMON LAM STOBS DAG GIS,
,RGYAL BA THAMS CAD YID KYI MNGON SUM DU,
,ZHING GI RDUL SNYED LUS RAB BTUD PA YIS,

By all the power
Of the prayer of Deeds of Goodness
Each and every Victorious One
Is actually here
Before my mind,
And I bow myself to them
Perfectly,
With bodies that are as many
As the atoms
Of all the worlds
Of the universe.]
Here first picture each and every Victorious One, those of every place, and
those of every time; see them in your mind, as if they were actually here before
you. Then send forth copies of yourself, bodies that are equal in number to the
atoms of all the worlds of the universe, and bow down to them.

Next is the prostration in mind. This too is found in a single verse, the one
with the words "Atop a single atom." [The full verse reads:

,RDUL GCIG STENG NA RDUL SNYEED SANGS RGYAS RNAMS,

Atop a single atom
Are Buddhas as many
As all the atoms
There are.
Around them are
Their sons and daughters.
I see
Every corner of space,
Each and every place,
Filled like this,
With Victors.]
Imagine every single atom of the universe, and atop each one see Buddhas, as
many as all the atoms there are. These Buddhas are surrounded by their
followers, all the bodhisattvas. Try to have a feeling where you see, where you
sense you are in the presence of, all their incredible good qualities.

LAG NI RGYU STE LCE'O, , RGYA MTSO NI MANG PO'I TSIG 
Last is the prostration in speech. This one is found in the single verse which
mentions "my words of admiration." [The full verse reads:

GO,DE DAG BSNGAGS PA MI ZAD RGYA MTSO RNAMS,
,DBYANGS KYI YAN LAG RGYA MTSO'I SGRA KUN GYIS,
,RGYAL BA KUN GYI YON TAN RAB BRJOD CING ,

I sing the praises
Of all those
Who have Gone to Bliss;
I proclaim
The high qualities
Of each and every Victor;
And my words of admiration
Are an ocean that will never dry,
A sea of sound
From the seed of harmony.]
Speak now words of admiration, words that never end, for each of the holy
beings before you, in a song of lovely harmony. Do this the way it is
described in the other books; turn each head of your bodies into an infinite
number of tongues, and sing. Here in the verse the word "harmony" refers to
the praises you sing, and their "seed" is what makes them come out; that is,
your tongue. The words "sea" and "ocean" express the idea of a multitude.

[b] This brings us to the second ingredient: offering. The offering which does
have something higher is found in the two verses that contain the words "holy
flowers". [The full verses read:

,ME TOG DAM PA 'PHRENG BA DAM PA DANG ,
,SIL SNYAN RNAMS DANG BYUNG PA GDUGS MCHOG DANG ,
,MAR ME MCHOG DANG BDUG SPOS DAM PA YIS,
,RGYAL BA DE DAG LA NI MCHOD PAR BGYI,
I make offerings
To all of these
Victorious Ones;
Holy Flowers, holy garlands,
Cymbals and ointments,
The highest parasol,
The highest lamp,
And holy incenses.

,NA BZA' DAM PA RNAMS DANG DRI MCHOG DANG ,
,PHYE MA PHUR MA RI RAB MNYAM PA DANG ,
,BKOD PA KHYAD PAR 'PHAGS PA'I MCHOG KUN GYIS,
,RGYAL BA DE DAG LA NI MCHOD PAR BGYI,
I make offerings
To all of these
Victorious Ones;
Holy silken clothing,
The highest scent,
And a mountain of incense powder
High as Meru--
All set forth
In a way more lovely
Than any other thing there is.]
The words "holy flower" refer to the most wondrous blooms of all in the lands
of both pleasure beings and humans; here they are single flowers. "Garlands"
are assortments of flowers pressed together on a string. Either way, the
flowers can be real ones, or made of other things.
The word "cymbals" refers to all types of music, whether it's on a stringed
instrument, a wind instrument, or percussion like drums or cymbals.
"Ointments" are thick potions with a delicious smell of incense. The "highest
parasol" is the finest of all umbrella-like coverings. The "highest lamp" is one
that burns from a fragrant mixture like incense and butter; it shines bright, and
gives forth a light as lovely as the flask of a precious gem. The incense
mentioned can be either the kind that is a concoction of various sweet-smelling
substances, or just one of these substances by itself.
"Holy silken clothing" refers to the finest of all the clothing there is. "Highest
scent" means perfumed liquid presented in the form of a water offering; it is
made of water, or something similar, imbues with a delicious scent so powerful
that it can spread throughout the entire system of a thousand thousand
planets. "Incense powder" refers to incense in the form of powder, which you
either spread itself or sprinkle atop a fire to make a fragrant smoke. It is in
packets, or else laid out in lines like the colored sand used to draw a mandala,
in a huge mass as high and wide as Meru, the great mountain in the center of
the world.
The phrase "set forth" applies to each of the substances that are being offered;
the original Sanskrit word here can mean "majority," or "put forth," or
"various."

,BKOD PA NI GONG MA KUN GYI MTHAR SBYOR BA STE PHAL CHE BA DANG SPRAS PA DANG SNA TSOGS PA LA BYA'O, , MCHOD PA BLA NA MED PA NI, MCHOD PA GANG RNAMS ZHES PA'I TSIGS BCAD GCIG STE, BLA NA YOD PA NI 'JIG RTEN PA'I MCHOD PA YIN PAS, 'DIR NI BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA' LA SOGS PA MTHU CAN RNAMS KYIS BZANG DGU SPRUL BA'O, , TSIG RKANG PA THA MA GNYIS NI GONG MA DE GNYIS MA TSANG BA THAMS CAD LA SBYAR TE PHYAG DANG MCHOD PA RNAMS KYI KUN SLONG DANG YUL STON PA'O,
The other kind of offering is the one which does not have anything higher.
This one is found in the single verse which includes the words "Any and every
offering." [The full verse reads:

,MCHOD PA GANG RNAMS BLA MED RGYA CHE BA,
,DE DAG RGYAL BA THAMS CAD LA YANG MOS,
,BZANG PO SPYOD LA DAD PA'I STOBS DAG GIS,
,RGYAL BA KUN LA PHYAG 'TSAL MCHOD PAR BGYI,
I see as well
Any and every offering
Unsurpassed, reaching far and wide,
Handed up to every Victor;
By all the power of my faith
In the Deeds of Goodness may I truly
Bow down and make offerings
Onto all the Victors.]
Offerings which we say "have something higher" are those of worldly beings.
Therefore the offerings made in this verse consist of all the many wondrous
things that very powerful beings, such as bodhisattvas, are capable of
emanating with their mind.
The words of the second half of this verse should be applied anywhere in the
verses before where the intent is not stated directly. Their function is to
express both the motivation with which the prostration and offering are made,
as well as the object towards which they are directed.

[c] The third ingredient is confession, and is found in the single verse with the
words "like and dislike". [The full verse reads:

,LUS DANG NGAG DANG DE BZHIN YID KYIS KYANG ,
,SDIG PA BDAG GIS BGYIS PA CI MCHIS PA,

I confess, one by one,
Each and every one
Of all the wrong deeds
I may have committed
In action or word,
And also thought,
Motivated by like or dislike,
Or by dark ignorance.]
This refers to what was done with one of the three mental poisons as its cause;
and with my body or of the rest as the vehicle; and with a nature of having
been committed, either directly by myself, or by someone else at my bidding,
or by someone else with my gladness that it was done. The words "all the
wrong deeds I may have committed" are meant to include all these elements.

Try to bring to mind all the problems that these deeds will bring you, and so
feel regret for whatever you have done in the past, and a sense to restrain
yourself in the future. Then make your confession. Doing this prevents any
future wrong from starting at all.

words "Victors in any of the ten directions." [The full verse reads:

By all of the Victors,
By all of their Sons and Daughters,
By those Self-Made,
By those on the paths of learning,
By those on the paths done learning,
By anyone at all.]
[d] Try to think about the great goodness that comes from the virtuous deeds
of these five different kinds of holy beings, and dwell in a sense of gladness,
like a beggar who has stumbled across a mine of gold.

[e] The fifth ingredient is urging holy ones to turn the Wheel of the Dharma.
This is found in the one verse with the words "Who in all the ten directions."

Saviors I urge You all,

Nothing is higher.]
This verse is addressed to those who in paradises in all the ten directions of
space have but only recently found Buddhahood in the Buddha's perfect
enlightenment--who have reached the state beyond desire, a knowledge which
goes anywhere it wants, unstoppable. We are urging them to send forth an
equal number of bodies, to come and teach the Dharma.
The commentary by Yeshe De gives the root text here as "found Buddhahood

Here we are making supplication to all those in worlds of the ten directions of
space who might pretend to pass into nirvana. We are requesting them to
stay, ultimately to bring all beings help, and in the interim to give them
happiness. We ask them to stay, and not to pass on, for eons equal in their
number to all the atoms that make up the various worlds of the universe. We
make our supplication, praying that they will remain, in bodies beyond all
counting.

I dedicate
To my future enlightenment
All my merit,
Whatever little goodness
I may have gathered here
By bowing myself and offering,

By confessing and rejoicing,
By urging and supplication.]
Here we are taking all the virtuous seeds within us, represented by the
goodness we have accomplished in practicing the six ingredients that have
already come, and dedicating them as a cause for the full enlightenment of
ourselves and every living being, together. Make this dedication with
tremendous will, and the power of your good will flow forever, and never
finish.
Read this prayer as I have taught you to here; understand what each verse
means, and say it out slowly, without letting your mind wander to something
else. If you can do this, then you will gain a great mountain of good deeds,
beyond any kind of measuring.
Five of the ingredients we have listed here--prostrating, offering, urging,
supplicating, and rejoicing--help you to gather together the different factors
that are conducive to the path. One of them, confessing, helps you clean
yourself of the factors that are obstacles, ones that oppose the path. One part
of rejoicing--dwelling in a sense of gladness over the good you have done
yourself--also functions to multiply your virtue.
Dedication works to multiply, fantastically, even the minor good deeds you
have done in the acts of gathering, and cleaning, and multiplying. It also takes
good deeds that are short-term, those that are going to give a good result and
then disappear, and changes them so that they will never be exhausted. In
brief, it functions in all three ways: to gather, to clean, and to multiply such
that goodness never ends.

For the sixth and final preliminary, refresh your visualization, and make an
offering of a mandala. Them make a request that the Lamas bless the stream

of your mind. Ask Them to help you stop, quickly, everything from
disrespecting your Spiritual Guide on up to grasping to some ingrained self-
nature, in either of its two forms. Ask Them to help you develop, smoothly,
every single kind of thought which is perfect and unmistaken; everything from
respect for your Spiritual Guide, on up to the realization of suchness, the fact
that nothing has any nature of its own. And ask them finally to help you put
a final end to all the things, within you or outside of you, that might obstruct
your spiritual progress.
Make this supplication over and over, many times, with fierce hopes for its
success.

Reading Three: The Six Conditions for Meditation
The following selection is taken from the Great Book on the Steps of the Path
(Lam-rim chen-mo) written by Je Tsongkapa (1357-1419).

ZHI GNAS KYI TSOGS,
The Conditions for Developing Quietude

*, , LAM RIM CHEN MO LAS,
From the Great Book on the Steps of the Path:

,SO SO'I BSLAB TSUL LA GSUM, ZHI GNAS LA BSLAB TSUL, LHAG MTHONG LA BSLAB TSUL, DE GNYIS ZUNG DU 'BREL BA'I TSUL LO, , DANG PO LA GSUM, ZHI GNAS KYI TSOGS BSTEN PA, DE LA BRTEN NAS ZHI GNAS BSGOM PA'I TSUL, BSGOMS PAS ZHI GNAS GRUB PA'I TSAD DO, , DANG PO NI RNAL 'BYOR PAS THOG MAR BDE ZHING MYUR DU ZHI GNAS 'GRUB PAR 'GYUR BA'I RGYU ZHI GNAS KYI TSOGS LA BRTEN PAR BYA'O, , 'DI LA DRUG LAS,
The explanation of how to train yourself in each of the two [quietude and
special sight] has three parts: how to train yourself in quietude, how to train
yourself in special sight, and how the two are joined in union. The first of
these parts itself has three sections: how to gather together the conditions for
quietude, how to meditate on quietude after you have gathered together these

conditions, and how to know when your meditation has actually brought you
to quietude. The first is described in the words, "Holy practitioners should
first gather together the conditions for quietude: the causes that will allow
them to develop quietude quickly and easily." Here there are six different
conditions.

1A/MTHUN PA'I YUL NA GNAS PA NI, YON TAN LNGA DANG LDAN PA'I YUL TE, ZAS GOS LA SOGS PA TSEGS MED PAR RNYED PAS RNYED SLA BA DANG , GCAN GZAN LA SOGS PA'I SKYE BO MI BSRUN PA DANG DGRA LA SOGS PA MI GNAS PAS GNAS BZANG BA DANG , NAD MI BSKYED PA'I SA YIN PAS SA BZANG BA DANG , TSUL KHRIMS DANG LTA BA MTSUNGS PA'I GROGS DANG LDAN PAS GROGS BZANG BA DANG , NYIN MO SKYE BO MANG PO MED CING MTSAN MO SGRA CHUNG BAS LEGS PAR LDAN PA'O,
[1] The first condition is to do your meditation staying in a place which is
conducive for it. The place should have five different qualities:
a) It should be a place with things that are "easy to find," in the
sense that you can find food, clothing, and other necessities
without any trouble.
b) It should be a "good place," in the sense that there are no fearful
creatures like wild animals or the like, nor any persons like
enemies who would try to harm you.
c) It should have a "good environment," in the sense that the
environment doesn't cause any kinds of sickness to develop in
you.
d) There should be "good friends" there, in the sense that your
companions in the place share your sense of morality, and your
world view.
e) The place should "have goodness," in the sense that, during the
day, there should not be many people around and, during the
night, there should not be many sounds.

,RNAL 'BYOR BDE BA'I YO BYAD LDAN,
,ZHES GSUNGS SO,
As the Jewel of the Sutras says,
The place where intelligent people practice
Should have things that are good to find,
It should be a good place, with a good environment,
A place where good friends stay,
With all the practitioner needs, with ease.

2A/, 'DOD PA CHUNG BA NI, CHOS GOS LA SOGS PA BZANG PO'AM MANG PO LA LHAG PAR CHAGS PA MED PA'O,
[2] The second condition is that you keep your wants few; you have no great
attachment to things like fine robes, or a lot of things, or the like.

3A/, CHOG SHES PA NI, CHOS GOS LA SOGS PA NGAN NGON TZAM RNYED PAS RTAG TU CHOG SHES PA'O,
[3] The third condition is that you are easily satisfied; you always feel like you
have enough, even if all you can find is robes or the like that are the worst.

[4] The fourth condition is that you give up trying to do too many things. You
give up undesirable actions like business; you avoid being too familiar with
laymen or monks; you stop practicing the minor arts of medicine, astrology,
or the like.

5A/, TSUL KHRIMS RNAM PAR DAG PA NI, SO THAR DANG BYANG SEMS KYI SDOM PA GNYIS KA LA RANG BZHIN DANG BCAS PA'I KHA NA MA THO BA'I BSLAB BYA'I GZHI MI 'DRAL BA DANG BAG MED PAS RAL NA'ANG SKYEN PAR 'GYOD PAS CHOS BZHIN DU PHYIR 'CHOS PAR BYED PA'O,
[5] The fifth condition is that your morality is perfectly pure. With regard to
your vows of individual freedom, and your bodhisattva vows, you never break
down the foundation of your training, the things you have been taught that are
naturally wrong to do, and those that the Buddha has prohibited. If out of a
lack of attention you do commit such deeds, your are quick to regret them, and
you try to make up in the proper way.

[6] The sixth condition is that you totally rid yourself of the stupid thoughts
of desire and the rest. You meditate on the problems of desire in this
life--how it can bring you to death, and to bondage; and you meditate on the
problems it brings you in the life after--a birth in the realms of misery, or the
like. Or else you can meditate on how each and every one of these pretty
things in the suffering cycle of life is going to end; how quickly it disappears;
how surely it will be torn from me before very long. Try then to get
accustomed to thoughts like this: So why do I find myself caring at all about
these things? What use are they for me? Use these to rid yourself of every
stupid thought of desire.

I have explained all these following the Stages of Meditation; for a more detailed
presentation, you can refer to the Levels of Listeners. These six include in them
all the essential points, all the causes and conditions you need to know to first
develop good concentration; and to keep from losing it once you have
developed it; and to bring it to an ever higher and higher state. The most
important points here are that you keep your morality pure, and that you
realize all the problems of desire, and that you stay in a place which is
conducive to meditation.

Geshe Tonpa has said, "When we find ourselves unable to develop deep
concentration, we blame it on the instructions we got, and we go and look for
some different ones. The real reason though is that we fail to do the
gathering." Here "gathering" refers to the six conditions and so on that I have
explained above.

We can also say that the first four of the perfections function as conditions for
the fifth perfection, of meditation. The first book of the Stages of Meditation
says,
If you want to reach quietude quickly, then make great effort:
don't be concerned with a desire for things; keep your morality
well; and be ready to undergo whatever pain or such you must.
This is in fact why texts like the exalted Commentary of the True
Thought teach that giving and the rest are causes for each of the
perfections above them.

A Lamp for the Path says as well,
You may try meditation as hard as you can,
But if the parts of quiet are lost
You may sit and practice for thousands of years
And never achieve this deep concentration.

Therefore those who are really serious about achieving the state of
concentration where quietude ("quiet") and special sight are joined must make
special efforts in the various "parts" or conditions of concentration, for example
in the thirteen conditions outlined in the Levels of Listeners. These conditions
are absolutely vital for your success.

Reading Four: The Eight-Part Posture
The following selection on the proper way to sit for meditation is taken from the Great
Book on the Steps of the Path to (Lam-rim chen-mo, ACIP electronic text
S5392), written by Lord Tsongkapa (1357-1419).

Here then is the section on how to meditate on quietude, once one has
assembled all the proper circumstances. There are two parts here: the
preparation, and then the actual meditation.

Here is the first of the two. As a preparation, one should begin with the six
preliminary practices presented above. One should, most especially, meditate
for an extended period of time on the Wish for enlightenment. As an auxiliary
to this meditation, one should finally train oneself in the subjects that are
shared with people of lesser and medium capacities.

Meditating itself can be presented in two parts: an explanation of how one
should position ones body during meditation, and an explanation of the actual
steps of meditation itself.

SGOM RIM BAR PA DANG THA MA LAS GSUNGS PA LTAR STAN SHIN TU 'JAM PO BDE BA LA LUS KYI KUN SPYOD CHOS BRGYAD DANG LDAN PAR BYA'O, ,
The middle and the final books of the Steps of Meditation explain how one
should position ones body; that is, one should sit on a very soft and
comfortable meditation cushion, in a position with eight different features.

[1] As for the legs, one should sit in a full lotus, similar to the full-lotus
position of the holy being named Vairochana. It is also quite acceptable to sit
in a half lotus position.

MIG NI HA CANG YANG MI DBYE HA CANG YANG MI ZUM PAR SNA'I RTZE MOR GTAD DO, ,
[2] Ones eyes should be loosely focussed around the plane of the tip of the
nose, and neither opened too wide nor completely closed.

[3] Avoid having your body lean too far back or too far forward: straighten up
your spine, and sit there directing your thoughts within.

[5] The head should be kept erect: neither tilted down nor up, nor pointed off
to the side. The nose should draw a straight line to the navel.

[6] Leave your teeth and your lips in their normal, natural position.

[8] As for the breath, see that it makes no noise as you breathe it in. Don't let
it be too rough, and don't just remain thoughtless about it. Try to reach a
point where you can hardly tell when it is coming and going; where it runs
very slowly and effortlessly.

In the Levels of Listeners, five different reasons are given for sitting in a cross-
legged position on a platform or seat of the kind allowed by Lord Buddha, and
covered with comfortable straw or grass.

When you position your body a bit strictly, it is quite conducive to reaching
the state of practiced ease; as a result, you will then be able to reach practiced
ease very quickly.

'DUG PAS DUS YUN RING PO 'DA' BAR BYED NUS SHING SPYOD LAM DES DE'I LUS SHIN TU NGAL BAR MI 'GYUR BA DANG ,
When you sit this way, you find yourself able to sit for a long period of time.
It also helps to prevent you from feeling tired.

Another advantage is that this position is unique to Buddhists, and cannot be
confused with the position of non-Buddhists in general, or of those whom you
may be debating.

GZHAN GYIS SPYOD LAM DES 'DUG PA MTHONG NA SHIN TU DANG BA SKYE BA DANG ,
Whenever someone else sees you sitting in this position, then they start to have
deep feelings of faith in you.

This position, finally, is one that Lord Buddha, and the disciples of Lord
Buddha, have granted us, and have used themselves. Understanding these five
reasons for doing so, states the text, one should determine to sit in a cross-
legged position.

LUS DRANG POR BSRANG BA NI RMUGS PA DANG GNYID MI 'BYUNG BA'I DON DU GSUNGS SO, ,
It is stated as well that the purpose of sitting up very straight is that this
prevents mental fogginess and sleepiness.

Practice then as we have explained it: start by putting your body into the
meditation position, and remember especially to bring your breathing down
first.

Readings Five and Six: The Five Problems of Meditation, and
the Eight Corrections
The following is a translation of a special chart on the stages of meditation designed
by Kyabje Trijang Rinpoche (1901-1981), tutor to His Holiness the XIVth Dalai Lama,
and Root Lama of Khen Rinpoche Geshe Lobsang Tharchin. The chart itself is found
in the pocket of the notebook for this course.

It has been spoken that each and every high spiritual quality of all three ways
is a result of meditation, either in the form of quietude (shamata), or some state
which is close to it. The benefits of meditation are many, beginning with the
fact that--once you have attained quietude--then any virtuous practice you
undertake becomes extremely powerful. It is an absolute necessity, and so
attaining the state of quietude is extremely important for any deep practitioner
who really hopes to reach freedom.

And here is how to do it. A meditator must first seek out all six of the
conditions that support the attempt to reach quietude. Then they should
acquaint themselves with the five obstacles to one-pointed concentration; these
are explained, in Lord Maitreya's work entitled Distinguishing the Middle and
the Extremes, as not feeling like meditating, losing the object, dullness and
agitation, failing to take action, and taking action when there is no need to do
so.
The corrections for the first of these obstacles are a deep belief in the benefits
of meditation, a strong desire to master it, the physical and mental pleasure of
a person who gets good at meditation, and the hard work needed to get good
at it.

GNYIS PA'I GNYEN POR DRAN PA, GSUM PA'I GNYEN POR SHES BZHIN, BZHI PA'I GNYEN POR 'DU BYED PA, LNGA PA'I GNYEN POR BTANG SNYOMS TE GNYEN PO 'DU BYED BRGYAD BSTEN NAS SGRUB DGOS LA,
The correction for the second obstacle is to bring the mind back to the object.
The correction for the third problem is watchfulness, and the correction for the
fourth is taking the necessary action. The correction for the fifth problem is to
leave well enough alone. Thus one must attain quietude through undertaking
eight different corrective actions.

It is further stated that--if you come to understand how these can be divided
into nine mental states, and how these in turn are achieved through six
different powers and grouped into four modes of focus--then you can quite
easily attain a state of single-pointed concentration which is perfect.

The text called The Essence of the Middle Way includes a verse that says,
Master the elephant of the mind
Step by step, as follows:
He wants to go the wrong way,
So be sure to tie him to the stake
Of the object of your meditation
With a strong rope made of bringing
The mind back to your object;
Then finally use the iron hook
Of your wisdom to take control.
Here the process of learning to meditate is being compared to the way in
which you tame a wild elephant, and this is the point of the illustration above.
Here I will give you just a rough explanation of each of the steps you see here.
 SEMS GNAS DGU NI, SEMS 'JOG PA, RGYUN DU 'JOG PA, GLAN DE 'JOG PA, NYE BAR 'JOG PA, DUL BAR BYED PA, ZHI BAR BYED PA, RNAM PAR ZHI BAR BYED PA, RTZE GCIG TU BYED PA, MNYAM PAR 'JOG PA RNAMS YIN LA,
The nine mental states are as follows: setting the mind on the object; keeping
the mind on the object with brief continuity; keeping the mind on the object
with patches where you lose the object; maintaining the mind tightly on the
object; controlling the mind; quieting the mind; completely quieting the mind;
attaining single-pointedness; and reaching deep meditation.

Here is how you use the six powers to attain these nine states. The first of the
states is attained through the power of learning the instructions for meditation
from your Lama. The second is reached through the power of contemplating
these instructions. You achieve the third and fourth mental states through the
power of bringing your mind back to the object. The fifth and sixth are
attained by the power of watchfulness. The seventh and eighth you bring
about through the power of effort, and the ninth with the power of complete
habituation.

Here is how these nine are grouped into four different modes of focus. During
the first and second mental states, you focus by forcefully concentrating the
mind. Over the course of the middle five states, you focus in a stream, but
with interruptions. In the eighth mental state you focus in an uninterrupted
stream, and during the ninth you focus on the object completely effortlessly.

The final result of attaining these nine states, one by one, is that you reach an
unshakeable state of physical and mental meditative pleasure. Simultaneous
to achieving this pleasure, you attain a state of quietude which is taken in by
the preparatory stage of the first concentration level, [which is the meditative
platform needed to see emptiness directly].

Suppose that, after achieving quietude in the way described above, you go on
to meditate one-pointedly upon the profound worldview of the middle way,
reaching a balance in your practice between the ability to analyze reality and
the ability to hold your mind fixed in meditation on the conclusions gained
from your analysis. This analysis will automatically enable you to reach an
extraordinary level of physical and mental meditative pleasure--and it is at
this point that we can say you have attained the special insight into reality
(vipashyana), in its authentic form.

If you practice these instructions correctly, then you will gain the razor-sharp
sword of wisdom, a form of one-pointed concentration where quietude and
special insight (shamata and vipashyana) are married together. You can then
carry this mighty sword onto the field of battle, and as time goes by smash the
two great obstacles [those to achieving nirvana, and those to achieving total
enlightenment]; that is, you can eliminate within you every undesirable quality.
With this you will win the great victory of the four bodies of a Buddha, and
find yourself able to perform enlightened deeds, constantly and spontaneously,
without any conscious thought--fulfilling the hopes of every living creature,
for as long as space itself endures.

The following is a list of the scenes found in the middle of the blockprint chart just
described.

1A/SEMS 'JOG PA,
[1] 1) Setting the mind on the object

4A/LAM GYI KHUG PA DRUG STOBS DRUG DANG SBYAR BA LAS DANG PO THOS PA'I STOBS SO, , 'DI LA BRTEN NAS SEMS GNAS DANG PO 'GRUB PA YIN,
[4] The six bends in the road represent the six powers. The first represents the
power of learning the instructions. Based on this, one achieves the first mental
state.

5A/GLANG PO SEMS DANG , KHA DOG NAG PA BYING BA MTSON,
[5] The elephant represents your mind, and his black color symbolizes dullness.
 6A/SPREL 'PHRO BA DANG , KHA DOG NAG PA RGOD PA MTSON,
[6] The monkey stands for distraction, and his black color represents agitation.
 7A/'DI NAS SEMS GNAS BDUN PA BAR ME LCE YOD MED DANG , CHE CHUNG GI KHYAD PAR BKOD PA NI, DRAN SHES KYI 'BAD RTZOL STOBS SHUGS BSKYED CHE CHUNG GI KHYAD PAR RO,
[7] The presence of the flames, and their relative size, from this point up to the
seventh mental state represent the relative amount of effort needed to bring
your mind back to the object, and the degree of watchfulness needed.

8A/BSAM PA'I STOBS SO, 'DIS SEMS GNAS GNYIS PA 'GRUB,
[8] The power of contemplating the instructions. You use this to reach the
second mental state.

9A/RGYUN DU 'JOG PA,
[9] 2) Keeping the mind on the object with brief continuity

1A0/'DI NAS GZUNGS MGO NAS DKAR CHA RIM GYIS 'PHEL BA DE GSAL CHA DANG , GNAS CHA JE 'PHEL 'GRO BA,
[10] The gradual increase in the white patch from this point on, starting with
the elephant's head, represents a gradual increase in the clarity and fixation of
the mind.

1A1/'DOD YON LNGA NI RGOD PA'I YUL MTSON,
[11] This symbol stands for the five objects of the senses, which themselves
represent the various objects that agitation focuses upon.

1A2/DRAN PA'I LTOBS SO, 'DIS SEMS GNAS GSUM PA DANG BZHI PA 'GRUB,
[12] The power of bringing the mind back to the object. This allows you to
attain the third and fourth mental states.

1A3/GLAN DE 'JOG PA,
[13] 3) Keeping the mind on the object, with patches where you lose the object.
 1A4/BYING BA PHRA MO, 'DI NAS BYING BA PHRA RAGS SOGS NGOS ZIN PA,
[14] Subtle dullness. From this point on, you are able to recognize the
distinction between obvious and subtle dullness, and other such details.

1A5/PHYI MIG BA LTA BA NI, SEMS G-YENG BA NGO SHES NAS SLAR DMIGS PA LA GTOD PA'O,
[15] The monkey looking back represents the ability both to tell when your
mind is wandering, and to re-focus it upon the object of meditation.

1A6/NYE BAR 'JOG PA,
[16] 4) Maintaining the mind tightly on the object.

1A7/SHES BZHIN GYI STOBS SO, , 'DIS SEMS GNAS LNGA PA DANG DRUG PA 'GRUB,
[17] The power of watchfulness. This allows you to reach the fifth and sixth
mental states.

1A8/RGOD PA SNGON LA SKYE BA'I NUS PA NYAMS PA,
[18] Agitation is the first of the two that loses its power to appear in your
mind.

1A9/GZHI GNAS SGRUB SKABS SEMS DGE BA'I PHYOGS LA 'PHRO BA'ANG BAR GCOD YIN PAS 'GOG DGOS KYANG , SKABS GZHAN DU MI 'GOG PAR DON GNYIS KYI 'BRAS BU LEN PA,
When you are trying to develop quietude, even allowing your mind to be
distracted to a virtuous object becomes an obstacle, and you must seek to stop
it. When you are doing other practices though you do not have to stop it.
And so we see the monkey reaching for the fruit of a second activity.

2A0/SHES BZHIN GYIS SEMS 'PHROR MI STER ZHING , GZENGS GTOD NAS TING 'DZIN LA DREN PA,
[20] Watchfulness will not let the mind get distracted; and uplifting your heart
leads you to a state of one-pointed concentration.

2A1/DUL BAR BYED PA,
[17] 5) Controlling the mind.

2A2/ZHI BAR BYED PA,
[22] 6) Quieting the mind.

2A3/BRTZON 'GRUS KYI STOBS SO, , 'DIS SEMS GNAS BDUN PA DANG BRGYAD PA 'GRUB,
[23] The power of effort. This allows you to reach the seventh and eighth
mental states.

2A4/RNAM PAR ZHI BAR BYED PA, SKABS 'DIR BYING RGOD PHRA MO'ANG SKYE DKA' LA CUNG ZAD SKYES KYANG DE MA THAG RTZOL BA CHUNG NGUS SPONG BAR BYES PA'O,
[24] 7) Completely quieting the mind. At this point it is difficult for even
subtle forms of dullness and agitation to occur. Even if they do come, you are
able to eliminate them immediately with a minimum of effort.

2A5/'DIR GLANG PO'I NAG CHA ZAD CING SPRE'U DANG BRAL BA NI THOG MAR DRAN SHES CUNG ZAD BRTEN NA BYING RGOD DANG 'PHRO BAS BAR GCOD MI NUS PAR TING 'DZIN CHAD MED DU 'JUG PA'O,
[25] Here the fact that the elephant has lost all the black, and left behind the
monkey as well, represents your ability to engage in one-pointed concentration
in an uninterrupted stream: if you apply just a little effort to bring your mind
to the object and maintain watchfulness, then dullness, agitation, and
distraction can no longer interrupt your meditation.

2A6/RTZE GCIG TU BYED PA,
[26] 8) Attaining single-pointedness

2A7/YONGS SU 'BRIS PA'I STOBS SO, , 'DIS SEMS GNAS DGU PA 'GRUB,
[27] The power of complete habituation, which enables you to reach the ninth
mental state

2A8/MNYAM PAR 'JOG PA,
[28] 9) Reaching deep meditation

2A9/ZHI GNAS THOB PA,
[29] Achieving quietude [shamata]

3A0/LUS SHIN SBYANGS,
[30] Physical meditative pleasure

3A1/SEMS SHIN SBYANGS,
[31] Mental meditative pleasure

3A2/STONG NYID LA DMIGS PA'I ZHI LHAG ZUNG 'BREL GYIS SRID RTZA GCOD PA,
[32] Special insight [vipashyana] and quietude [shamata] marry together,
focussing on emptiness, and allow you to cut the root of this suffering life.

3A3/DRAN SHES SHUGS CAN GYIS LTA BA 'TSOL BA,
[33} One goes on to seek the correct view of reality, with a great ability to
bring the mind to the object, and to maintain watchfulness.

Here is the third division, which is a description of how one achieves the nine
states of meditation using the steps explained above. Anyone who hopes to
practice meditation must become proficient in these nine states; and to become
proficient in them, one must know what they are. So here is an explanation
of the nine states, which are called (1) placing the mind on the object; (2)
placing the mind on the object with some continuity; (3) placing the mind on
the object and patching the gaps; (4) placing the mind on the object closely; (5)

Here is the first state of meditation, called "placing the mind on the object."
You achieve this state by means of receiving instructions from your lama about
the object you should use for your meditation. The mind at this point stays on
the object only from time to time, and for the most part is not fixed on the
object at all: you are unable to keep your mind on the object for any
continuous length of time. The two mental functions of noting and examining
are present, and due to this you often lose yourself to scattering and agitation.
You become aware of this condition and so you get the impression that you
have even a greater problem of too many thoughts coming up to your mind
than you ever had before. What's really happening though is not that you
have more of these thoughts than before; it's just that you have now become
aware of the problem.

Here is the second state of meditation, called "placing the mind on the object
with some continuity." This state is reached when you practice placing the
mind on the object enough that you can now keep your mind on it for some
continuous, although brief, period of time. You could say it would be like
being able to keep your mind from wandering for as long as it would take to
do one round of the mani mantra on your rosary. At this point your problem
of having too many thoughts goes away for a while, and then comes back for
a while, so the impression you have is that these thoughts are making a

periodic resurgence. This particular state of meditation is achieved through
contemplating.

During these first two states of meditation, you have an abundance of dullness
and agitation, and only occasionally fix your mind on the object. Therefore at
this point we say that your mind is in the first of the four mental modes, the
one described as having to "concentrate to focus." During these stages, said
our Lama, the periods of distraction last longer than the periods in which the
mind is fixed on the object.

Here is the third state of meditation, called "placing the mind on the object and
patching the gaps." The place where you put a normal patch is a piece of
cloth; here the place you put the patch is the continuation of your focus. What
this means is that you catch your mind quickly after it wanders away from the
object, and so "patch" the hole in the continuation. The difference between this
state of meditation and the two that come before it is in the length of time you
are distracted. Our Lama also noted that this is the time when you are able to
develop your recollection to a high degree.

Here is the fourth state of meditation, called "placing the mind on the object
closely." Since by now your recollection is highly developed, you are able to
place your mind on the object of meditation in such a way that it is no longer
possible to lose it completely; this then is what differentiates this state from the
three before it. Even though you are succeeding in keeping the object from
being lost, nonetheless dullness and agitation are present in your mind, and
they are very strong. Therefore you must at this point apply the correction for
dullness and agitation. These two levels, the third and fourth, are achieved by
means of recollection. Our Lama noted that from this point on the power of
our meditation was complete, or full-grown, like a person who has reached
maturity.

Here is the fifth state of meditation, called "controlling the mind." There is a
tendency during the fourth state to draw your mind too far inside, and there
is a great danger that this can lead to subtle dullness. Therefore we must now
develop our watchfulness to a high degree. It goes and spies on the mind, and
finds something wrong; in response then we must uplift the mind by thinking
over the many benefits that single-mindedness can bring to us. The difference
between this state and those before it is whether or not obvious dullness can
occur.

Here is the sixth state of meditation, called "pacifying the mind." The great
danger at this point is that subtle agitation occurs, as a result of uplifting the
mind too far while in the fifth state. Whenever this subtle agitation comes, you
must raise up a powerful kind of watchfulness to detect it; realize that even
very subtle agitation is a serious fault in your meditation, and stop it. What
distinguishes this stage from the one before it is whether or not there is a great
danger of having subtle dullness. These last two states, the fifth and the sixth,
are achieved by means of watchfulness. From this point on, said our Lama,
the power of our watchfulness is complete.

By the time you reach the seventh state of meditation, which we call "pacifying
the mind totally," your recollection and watchfulness are total, and so it is
unlikely that dullness and agitation are going to occur. At this point you must
bring your effort up to a powerful level; see how destructive even subtle forms
of dullness and agitation are, and do whatever you can to eliminate them
altogether. The difference between this state and the ones before it is whether
or not you should worry much about slipping into subtle dullness or agitation.
Although there is no great danger at this point that subtle dullness and
agitation will occur, you must still make great effort to implement the various

methods for eliminating them. While you are in the fifth and sixth states of
meditation, you still have to be concerned whether or not dullness and
agitation are going to attack you. Here in the seventh state though you have
the ability to initiate the effort necessary to block them; and so, said our Lama,
dullness and agitation are unable to attack and create an obstacle. During
these last five states of meditation--that is, from the third through to the
seventh--the mind is for the most part in single-pointed meditation.
Nonetheless, conditions such as dullness and agitation are interrupting ones
concentration, and so we describe the mental mode during these periods as
"engaging but interrupted."

Here is what happens when you reach the eighth state of meditation, called
"making the mind single-pointed." When you begin a meditation session, you
must still make a slight effort to bring up the various corrections. After that
though you are able to go for an entire session without even the subtle forms
of dullness and agitation coming up in the mind. These last few stages are like
having an enemy who is at full strength, one who has lost part of his strength,
and one whose strength is completely lost. Since these examples describe how
dullness and agitation gradually lose their power, we can say that from the
eight state of meditation you no longer need to make any conscious effort to
apply watchfulness. Because in this eighth state you can make a little effort at
the opening of a meditation session and then pass the entire period without
being interrupted by problems such as dullness and agitation, the mental mode
at this point is described as "engaging without interruption." The seventh and
eighth states of meditation are achieved through applying effort.

Here is the ninth state of meditation, called "achieving equilibrium." Here your
mind is engaging in the object without any conscious effort at all. This state
comes about as a result of having repeated the eighth state over and over until
you are completely accustomed to it, and then you can go into meditation
spontaneously, effortlessly. This is similar to the point you reach in your
recitations when you can read out a text from memory without any effort,
since you have practiced reciting it repeatedly. You go into single-minded
meditation in a single swoop. This state of mind is for all intents and purposes
a desire-realm form of single-pointed quietude. The ninth state is achieved
through being totally accustomed.

The impression you have during the first state is one of recognizing that you
have too many thoughts. In the second state you have a feeling that they are
making a resurgence. By the third state the impression is that the problem of
too many thoughts has in a sense tired out. In brief then we can say that in
the first two states there is a question of how long the mind can stay fixed on
the object. What distinguishes the third and the fourth states is whether or not
one can lose the object or not. The fourth and fifth states are differentiated by
whether obvious dullness can arise or not. The fifth and sixth states are
separated by whether or not you have to be worried about subtle dullness
coming up. Moreover, there is the distinction that--although it is possible for
subtle agitation to occur during the sixth state--it is much less likely than in
the one before it. The sixth and seventh states are distinguished by whether
or not you have to be very concerned about slipping into subtle agitation or
dullness. States number seven and eight are separated by whether there is any
agitation or dullness at all; and eight and nine are differentiated by whether or
not you have to rely on any conscious effort. The seventh level is devoted to
eliminating dullness and agitation, rather than having to think about any
serious danger that you could slip into them. Our Lama said that at this point
it was like having a fist-fight with an enemy who was already weakened to the
point of exhaustion; it's not like you need to be on your guard especially, it's
enough just to be thinking about how to finish him off.

FOREWORD
Before you start this little book, decide on your motivation for reading it.
Think to yourself,
I want to reach enlightenment as soon as possible. I
want to reach it in this very life. And when I do, I
will free every living being from every pain of the
suffering existence we all live now. Then I will take
all these beings up to the level of a Buddha, which is
the ultimate state of happiness. This is why I am
going to read this book, which shows all the steps to
enlightenment.
Take a moment now before you go on. Make sure you have this motivation.
This little book covers absolutely everything that the Buddha ever taught. In
Tibet we have a hundred great volumes of the Buddhas' own teachings,
translated into Tibetan from Sanskrit, the language of ancient India. And this
small book covers all of them.
All the old, great books of Buddhism have but one main goal, and that is to
show how any one of us can reach the state of perfect enlightenment. They tell
us everything we have to do: how to reach the goal, how to practice, and how
to learn. They show us how to begin, they show us how to finish. Everything
we need is in those books.
Five hundred years ago in Tibet there came a master monk and teacher, whose
name was Tsongkapa the Great. He took these ancient volumes and arranged
them into a kind of book known as the Lam Rim, which means "Steps of the
Path to Enlightenment." Here he laid out all the steps that any of us can go
through, one by one in the proper order, if we truly wish to reach
enlightenment. He took care to present the steps clearly and simply, yet
covering everything that must be done, as we start on the path, and travel
along it, and finally reach its end.

The small book here is called the Source of All My Good. It is the absolute
essence of all the Lam Rims, of all the books on the Steps to enlightenment.
The text was written by Tsongkapa himself, and it is named from the opening
lines, which read: "The source of all my good is my kind Lama, my Lord."
In the teachings on the Steps this work is also known by another name,
something of a secret name, which is Begging for a Mountain of Blessings. The
word "blessing" here refers to the blessings of all the Buddhas of the universe.
"Mountain" comes from a Tibetan word which means a huge pile, a great mass
of things all heaped together in one place. The word "begging" is meant to
show how much we need and want these blessings.
When we recite this work out loud, then, it's as though we are begging the
Buddhas to grant us their blessings, to help us achieve everything from the
beginning up to final enlightenment. We are asking them to help us reach all
the various paths, all the different levels of knowledge; we are asking for the
power of their blessings, we are begging them for help.
Just whom are we asking for help? Normally when we perform the secret
Ceremony of the Tenth, we begin with the Practice of Six, followed by the
Thousand Angels. Just after that we start this Source of All My Good. Therefore
we still have in front of us the same holy beings who were there during the
Thousand Angels.
Sitting in the center, in mid-air before us, is Tsongkapa. Inside his heart is
Gentle Voice, or Manjushri, who is the image of all the Buddhas' wisdom. In
the heart of Gentle Voice is another holy being, Vajradhara--this is the Keeper
of the Diamond, or the Buddha of the secret teachings. His body is blue, and
within his own heart is the Sanskrit letter huung. This letter is marked with
another letter, mam.
On Tsongkapa's own right is his disciple Gyaltsab Je, whose full name is
Gyaltsab Darma Rinchen. Within this disciple's heart is Loving Eyes, whose
Sanskrit name is Avalokiteshvara, and who is the embodiment of all the
Buddhas' love. Inside the heart of Loving Eyes is again the Keeper of the
Diamond, and in his heart the letter huung, marked with a mam.
On the other side, to Tsongkapa's left, is his disciple Kedrup Je, whose full
name is Kedrup Je Gelek Pelsang. Inside of his heart is the Holder of the
Diamond, or Vajrapani, and in the Holder's heart is the Keeper of the
Diamond. Within the Keeper's heart is a letter huung, marked with a mam.
All of these beings are seated in the air in front of you, and they are the ones
whom you are asking for their blessing. They are the ones that you are
requesting to help you, to grant you every kind of knowledge, from the
beginning of the path on up to final enlightenment.

Now I want you to think about something. What is the difference between a
Buddha and us? What is it that makes all the Buddhas different from us?
And what about you, yourself? You are trying to reach Buddhahood; but what
is the difference between all these Buddhas, and you? This is a question you
must examine, and then the answer will come to you.
What are the Buddhas? First of all the places where they live are paradise.
Pure paradise. The paradises where the Buddhas live are completely pure,
they are pure by their very nature, and there is not a single thing about them
which is not pure.
Inside themselves too the Buddhas are pure. They have no inner obstacles at
all, no bad deeds stored up in them, no problems of any kind. They have none
of the problems that are caused by any of the four elements of the physical
world, either around them or within them. They have no sickness, no getting
old, no death. They do not even have a word for these things where they live.
This is why their paradises have names like the "Heaven of Bliss," for they live
in the highest happiness that there is.
When we think about our own lives then we can see the big difference
between Buddhas and us. In one sense we are very fortunate; we have all had
the very great fortune to be born as a human being, and we can enjoy that
small amount of happiness which human beings sometimes experience. And
so sometimes we think we are happy.
But still we have problems, a lot of problems. We have problems all around
us, and we have problems inside of us. We have problems that come with the
very nature of the kind of life we live. The Buddhas have none of these
problems.
Try to think about this difference between the Buddhas and you. Why did you
get this book, why are you going to read this book? The main purpose is to
reach enlightenment, to gain the highest state of happiness that exists. And to
get there you must escape all the sufferings that come with our present kind
of life.
To do all this you are going to have to follow some kind of practice. You are
going to have to move up through certain levels, certain paths, one by one
through a great many different Steps. You will have to go in order, gradually,
through each of these Steps. Each higher Step you will have to reach by
practicing, and to practice you must learn what to practice. If you never learn
what to do, you will never be able to do it.
In this little book you are going to learn what to do. But this is only a
preparation for something else.

Generally speaking, this book is all you need. If this is all you ever learn, and
if you practice what you learn here, then you will reach enlightenment. But
it will take a long time to do so if you restrict yourself to this way, to the way
of the open teachings of the Buddha. It will take a very, very long time.
But you want enlightenment, you need it, and you need it now. Why?
Because the reason you are reading this book, the whole point of studying
these things and reaching these goals, is to help each and every living being.
All of them have been your own mother, and the purpose of everything is to
help them.
Right now they are suffering, by the very nature of the life we live. Most of
them are living in the three lower kinds of birth. Even those who live in one
of the higher kinds of birth are suffering too; by the very nature of things, they
are in some kind of pain, all the time. Your goal is to save them from this
pain, your goal is to help them reach enlightenment, which is absolute
happiness. This is why you are studying, this is why you are practicing.
If you only use the way of the open teachings, it will take a long time to reach
the goal. But you want the goal now, you want to reach it quickly, because all
these living beings around you, all who have been your mother during some
lifetime in the past, are suffering in this kind of existence. You cannot stand
to have their pain continue, you cannot let them go on suffering so long.
And so you will free them, and you will free them quickly, now. But is there
any way to do it so fast? The answer is yes, there is a way, a path that works
faster than any other, a path which is very deep and powerful and holy. This
is the Tantric path, the secret path of the Diamond Queen: Vajra Yogini.
To practice this path you must receive an initiation to enter it, and then you
must receive her teachings. But before you can do this you must first be
granted another initiation, one which will qualify you to study and follow her
path. There are four great groups of secret teachings, and to qualify to practice
the path of this Angel you must be granted an initiation that belongs to the
group which is called the "unsurpassed." Therefore the most important thing
for you to do first is to seek an initiation of the "unsurpassed" group.
According to the tradition of the Diamond Queen, the best initiation to prepare
yourself for her own initiation and path is the one we call the "Union of the
Spheres," or Chakrasamvara. There are though other initiations of the
unsurpassed group which you can seek if you cannot get this one; for example,
there is the initiation of the being known as Frightener*, or Bhairava, which is
much shorter and easier than the one for the Union of the Spheres, and still
qualifies you to take her initiation later.

There is another step you should take too before seeking her initiation. When
you go to a college to get an advanced degree, or any degree at all, you must
first enter the college. Then you go to classes, do your study, and finally after
a number of years you complete all the requirements, and reach your goal. To
reach the goal then it is very important that you study and learn, on a constant
basis. But to study, and learn, you first have to gain entrance into the college.
It's all the same here. The first thing you have to do is to gain entrance into
the unsurpassed group of the secret teachings of the Buddha. To enter these
teachings you have to go through the gate, and this is the initiation. The
initiation is the door.
When you take the initiation, you commit yourself to a number of vows.
Keeping these vows is like doing your study on a daily basis once you've been
allowed to enter the college. In a school you have to learn what to study, and
then you have to maintain a regular schedule of study. Here in the secret
teachings, the vows that you took when you received your initiation are what
you have to study: these are what you have to maintain on a regular, daily
basis.
To keep the vows, you have to learn all about them. This is why it's essential
that after your first initiation you study, in detail, the secret vows, along with
the regular vows of morality, and the bodhisattva vows. The very function of
these vows, the result of these vows, is very simple. If you keep them, they
produce enlightenment in you.
Aside from this main function, keeping the vows has another effect as well.
In the short run--that is, while you are still on the path, from the very
beginning on up to the day you reach the ultimate goal--they help you, they
keep you, they preserve you. They make you sweeter and sweeter, more and
more pure, every single day you keep them. Everything about you gets better
and better: the way you act, the way you think, higher and higher, day by day,
month by month.
The vows then are your dear companion, the vows are your devoted helpmate.
Vows are not some kind of punishment; the Lama doesn't come to the sacred
place of initiation, and say to you, "Well now that you've got the initiation,
here are some vows to keep, as a punishment." You must understand all the
great good which the vows do for you, and you must learn what they are.
Once you have learned the vows, you must keep them as your daily practice.
You should reach a point where, as you look back after some time has passed,
you can see progress, you can say to yourself, "A number of years ago, I used
to act like that; I had a certain kind of attitude, certain ways of behaving, the
limitations of my knowledge were such, and my ability too was only so. Now
they have all changed, for the better. Even in the last two years I have

changed; no, even in the last year I have changed." You should be able to see
for yourself, you should be able to judge, by yourself, whether you are keeping
the vows, and how it changes everything about you.
So we are working mainly towards the day when we can receive initiation into
the practice of the Diamond Queen. This will allow us to receive her
teachings, and then to carry them out. To do this, we will first have to seek
any one of the preliminary initiations into the secret teachings of the
unsurpassed group, the highest group of secret teachings.
A person who seeks to be granted an initiation into this highest group should
himself be highest, in the sense that he is highly qualified to receive the
initiation. Becoming highly qualified is something that you must do in the
proper stages, in certain steps, one by one.
Above I asked you to think about what it was that made Buddhas different
from us. In the beginning though all the beings who are Buddhas now were
just the same as we are at present. They lived the same kind of suffering life
that we pass our days in now, and they did so over millions and millions of
years, over very many lifetimes.
At some point though these beings were able to achieve an excellent life as a
human; the same kind that you have now. Within that human life they were
able to meet with an excellent spiritual teacher as well. He or she gave them
the proper training, and the necessary initiations, and as a result these beings
began to get better and better. Finally they achieved enlightenment: they were
able to stop all the problems within them and outside of them, everything. If
they have been able to practice and achieve this goal, then why can't you?
Why not?
And so it is possible for you to become someone who is highly qualified, who
is qualified to an unsurpassed degree to take one of the initiations of the
unsurpassed group of the secret teachings. To be qualified to take this
initiation, to be a highly qualified practitioner in this sense, means that you
must be a practitioner of what we call the Mahayana: the Greater Way. This is
because all the secret teachings also belong to the greater way; they are in fact
the highest teachings and practices of the greater way. You too then will have
to be an unsurpassed practitioner, of the greater way. But how do you reach
this point?
You must first prepare yourself, with what we call the "shared" practice. The
word "shared" means that this preliminary practice is shared by the way of the
open teachings, and the greater way, and the way of the secret teachings--all
three. It is a practice which all three ways share in common.

Suppose you are planning to construct a very high building, a building with
many stories. The most important thing to do first is to build a good
foundation, a very strong foundation. If the foundation is strong, then you can
build as many stories as you like on top of it.
The little book you have here--Begging for a Mountain of Blessings, complete
with the commentary of the great Pabongka Rinpoche--presents this
foundation. It shows you the practice which is shared by all three ways, and
which will prepare you for initiation into the secret teachings. This is the
strong foundation upon which you will build your great, high house.
Think about it, and be happy. Take some joy now in what you are about to
do. You must realize what a precious opportunity you have in your hands at
this very moment, this one good time. Read, and learn, and try not to forget.
Try to remember what you learn in this little book, and then try to put it into
practice, in your daily life, in a regular way.
By the time you finish this book you should be a different person. The person
who picks this book up to read, and the person who sets it down after
finishing the last page, should be totally different people. On the inside. You
must change: you must change in the way you think, you must change in what
you know, in the way you behave all day, in everything about you. Try to
change yourself. If you do, then you will win the result of reading this book,
of picking it up, and of entering into what it stands for.

Abbot Emeritus, Sera Mey Tibetan Monastery
Abbot, Rashi Gempil Ling Kalmuk Buddhist Temple

Je Tsongkapa's Day
December 27, 1994
ABOUT THE AUTHORS
JE TSONGKAPA (1357-1419), also known as Je Rinpoche Lobsang Drakpa,
was perhaps the single greatest commentator in the 2,500 year history of
Buddhism. He was born in the district of Tsongka in eastern Tibet and took
his first vows at a tender age. As a teenager he had already mastered much
of the teachings of Buddhism and was sent by his tutors to the great monastic
universities of central Tibet. Here he studied under the leading Buddhist
scholars of his day; it is said as well that he enjoyed mystic visions in which
he met and learned from different forms of the Buddha himself.

The 18 volumes of Tsongkapa's collected works contain eloquent and incisive
commentaries on virtually every major classic of ancient Buddhism, as well as
his famed treatises on the "Steps of the Path to Buddhahood." His students,
who included the first Dalai Lama of Tibet, contributed hundreds of their own
expositions of Buddhist philosophy and practice.
Tsongkapa founded the Great Three monasteries of Tibet, where by custom
nearly 25,000 monks have studied the scriptures of Buddhism over the
centuries. He also instituted the great Monlam festival, a period of religious
study and celebration for the entire Tibetan nation. Tsongkapa passed away
in his 62nd year, at his home monastery of Ganden in Lhasa, the capital of
Tibet.
PABONGKA RINPOCHE (1878-1941), also known as Jampa Tenzin Trinley
Gyatso, was born into a leading family in the state of Tsang in north-central
Tibet. As a boy he entered the Gyalrong House of Sera Mey, one of the
colleges of the great Sera Monastic University, and attained the rank of geshe,
or master of Buddhist philosophy. His powerful public teachings soon made
him the leading spiritual figure of his day, and his collected works on every
facet of Buddhist thought and practice comprise some 15 volumes. His most
famous student was Kyabje Trijang Rinpoche (1901-1981), the junior tutor of
the present Dalai Lama. Pabongka Rinpoche passed away at the age of 63 in
the Hloka district of south Tibet.

Herein contained is a book named Opening Your Eyes to What You Should Keep,

It consists of a brief series of notes that were
taken at a teaching delivered by the Lord of the Secret World, Vajradhara, the
Keeper of the Diamond, the Good and Glorious Pabongka.2
The teaching was
a profound explanation of the text known as the Source of All My Good,3
a work
which is the distilled essence of the Steps of the path to Buddhahood.

Here I will give just a brief account of a wonderful teaching bestowed upon us by the
One, the Lord of the Secret World, the Savior of His Followers, and the Keeper of the
Diamond: Pabongka Rinpoche, whose kindness knows no match.
His teaching was a profound clarification of the one and only highway used by each
and every Victor of the past, present, and future to reach the highest goals; the Steps
on the path to Buddhahood, its very essence distilled; the inner nectar of the
instructions imparted by our Father, the Lord, the Buddha himself come again; and the
ultimate elixir extracted from the highest of words, the Speech of the Enlightened
Ones: that is to say, the work known to us as the Source of All My Good, also called
Begging for a Mountain of Blessings.6

As he began the teaching, the Lord himself led us in reciting the Essence of Wisdom,
and then the prayer of Simhamukhi--the Angel with the Face of a Lion, from the part
where we ward off any evil that might disrupt the teaching, all the way up to the
words "May goodness come to be," in the way we usually do them.

Then in turns we took the lead, sounding out in unison the various verses that include
the words "Virtues perfected finally," and "Loving One, Avalokiteshvara, with
Asanga," and "Gentle Voice, Manjushri, with the one who destroyed the extremes of
being and not," and "The one of great compassion," and "Teaching what to learn, to
reach," and "Founder from the Land of Snows," and "All three places of refuge in

The lead then went to the chanting master, who guided us in the offering of the
mandala, beginning with "The great Earth, filled with the smell of incense," and on
through "Atop a lion throne in the space before me," as well as "Sponges of the sky,
made of most excellent knowledge and love," along with the lines that begin with
idam guru.

The lead returned to the Keeper of the Diamond, who deigned to direct us thrice
through the prayer for taking refuge and developing the wish for enlightenment, the
one that includes the words "To the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha." Here finally the
Lord himself bespoke the verses containing the lines "Pleasure beings and those near
so," along with "In the language of pleasure beings" and the rest.7

THE PRELIMINARIES

"And so we begin," said the Lama.
Let me remind you, he said, of those lines by the King of the Dharma of all
three realms--Tsongkapa the Great; the ones that mention "This life of spiritual
leisure, more precious than a jewel that can give you whatever you wish for."8
The refrain throughout these verses reads: "Those of you who wish for freedom
should seek to master this, as I have done." You and I have lived in this circle
of suffering life forever; and there is not a single form of life, in any of the six
realms of pain, that we have not already lived.

In these lives we have suffered, and enjoyed the occasional short-lived
pleasure, wandering aimlessly from that high level known as the "Peak of
Existence," then down to the lowest hell, "Torment with No Respite," then back,
and back again. We have lived this way for time with no beginning, and yet
we have never gotten any meaning out of it; the time has slipped away from
us useless, senseless, empty. And so still we are here, circling up and down
in the three realms of the wheel of life, and certain we are to continue the
round.

At some point in days gone by, you and I through sheer good luck were taken
for some brief moments under the care of a Lama, or the Three Jewels, and so
were able to gather together some bit of pure and powerful karma. The force
of this karma, I will admit, has allowed us to gain, just this once, the present
life we enjoy--full of the various leisures and fortunes, free of the problems
that come when we lack the conditions that allow a proper spiritual practice.

I will admit as well that everything we need has come together for us this
time: we have a Lama, we have some Dharma to practice, we have every
favorable condition that we need. And so the capability to follow the spiritual
path is something we now hold in our own two hands. Yet suppose we fail;
suppose that we find ourselves unable to achieve the ultimate goal of the
infinite lives we have led.

Beyond a doubt then we will fall back again to the births where we have no
chance for Dharma. And when we fall it matters not where we fall; wherever
we fall in a birth without the Dharma, our life can never be anything but pain.

The way to avoid ever taking another birth where we have no chance for
Dharma is to practice the Dharma purely now; there is no better way at all.
And our practice must start this minute; you will die, you must die, it is
certain you will die. But you've no idea when. And what will happen after
that?

Whatever we do now decides where we go then: if we do good, it will throw
us forth into one of the better births; if we do wrong, it will throw us to a birth
of misery. So suppose we fail to practice; suppose we die in the middle of our
present evil way of life. It is only fitting then that we should go right where
we belong: to these very births of misery.

We must then for the short term go for shelter to the Three Jewels, to keep
ourselves from a birth in the lower realms. We must as well open up and
admit the things we have done wrong before, and restrain ourselves in the
future. To do so we must make strong and heartfelt use of the four forces9
that
counteract the power of the wrong. We must too put all our effort into taking
up even the smallest virtue, and giving up even the slightest harms we commit
against others.

If in addition to all this we are able to follow perfectly the path of the three
extraordinary trainings,10
then we ourselves will come to be free of each and

every fear of the circle of suffering life. But it's not enough if it is only you

Even a cow knows how
To take care of himself,
To eat a few clumps of grass
He easily comes across;
Even the beast can merrily drink
From a pool of water he finds
As bitter thirst Torments him.
But think now what it is
To put your whole heart
Into taking care of others;
This is glory,
This is a park of pleasure,
This is the ultimate.

GZHOL,
The Sun
Climbs aboard his fantastic chariot,
Flies across the sky,
Lights up all the world.
The Earth
Raises up his mighty arms,
Bears the load,
Holds up all mankind.
And so is the way
Of those great beings
Who wish nothing
For themselves,
Their lives devoted
To a single song:
The well-being and the happiness
Of every living thing.11

We must do as the verses say: we must distinguish ourselves from common
animals, we must find that great courage of heart to accomplish the goals of
all other sentient kind. And there is a good reason why we should.

Every single creature in the universe has been our father, and been our mother,
not once, but more times than numbers can count. And there is not a one who
when they served as our parent did not shower us with every deep kindness,
over and over again.

Suppose then I were to forget their kindness, and give no thought to returning
it. This would truly be an evil way to act, the way of a person without a
conscience, of one who had no shame. For the Verses of Drumsong, King of the
Serpentines, say as well:

Think: everything we have now, from this precious human body on up, has
come to us through the kindness of other living beings. And so it is now that
we must repay them. The repayment must begin here, in these circumstances,
while I am able, while I possess this perfect form for the practice of the
Dharma.

If now I cannot accomplish this great goal, if all I have gained is wasted, then
there is little point in claiming to work for every living being: it is little likely
that I myself will be able even to reach the higher realms of suffering life
again.

What is the way then to pay this kindness back? No way would be higher
than to see to it that every living creature has every happiness there is, and
that every living creature is free of every pain which exists. And I will do it!
Raise these thoughts of love and compassion up in your heart--bring them on
fiercely.

to every being, and frees each one from every pain."

And yet the ability to perform this noble task is had only by a single being:
only by a Buddha, there's no one else at all who can do it. If for the sole
purpose of all other living creatures I can reach the state of a Buddha, then I
can fulfill completely both of the ultimate goals,14
and so by the way achieve
everything I ever needed as well.

If this is not the way I go--if instead I achieve a lower nirvana, and become
one of those foe destroyers they call a listener, or a "self-made buddha,"15
then
I cannot achieve all that I need myself, and can accomplish no more than a
shadow of what others need from me.

And so I must reach the state of a Buddha, the One who has come to the final
end where his own and other's needs are perfectly filled. To do so, I must
know how. To know how, I must learn how. I will begin with the Dharma
of this very teaching, and others like it; I will follow these instructions well,
and I will come to the state of Buddhahood itself. Think these thoughts to
yourself, here as our teaching starts, for they are the greater way's Wish for

Buddhahood. At the very least, you must try to imitate this line of thinking;
even if you cannot do the real thing, let these thoughts dwell in your heart all
through the teaching that you are about to hear.

And what is the teaching that you are to hear? It was spoken by our Gentle
Savior, by the Lama, the Great Tsongkapa, at Yangon--the hermitage of the
Victor. This was at the monastery of Radreng, standing to the north, at the
foot of a great crag of rock shaped like the mouth of a lion.16
The Lord imparted these vital instructions to his disciples there, acting only for
the good of living beings and the Buddha's Word. The title of the text he
spoke is the Source of All My Good; it is also known by another name, Begging
for a Mountain of Blessings.

This is a work of the kind we call the "Steps to Buddhahood"; books like this
contain within themselves each and every crucial point in all the open and
secret teachings of Buddhism. They present these points without the slightest
error, from the very beginning to the very end: from finding and serving a
spiritual guide on up to the perfect secret Union, where there is nothing more
to learn.

These teachings on the Steps are the pure essence of everything that all the
victorious Buddhas have ever spoken, the sum rolled into one. They are the
one and only form of the Teaching that embodies all of the greater way; they
are the point of the tip of the highest, matchless peak.

Our Lord Lama, in his work entitled Songs of My Spiritual Life, says,
When within yourself you've developed
The path that is shared,
The one that's needed
For both the highest paths...17

,ZHES PA LTAR SPYIR MDO SNGAGS GANG YIN YANG CHOS BYANG CHUB LAM GYI RIM PA 'DI MED THABS MED LA, LHAG PAR DU RGYAL MCHOG LNGA PA CHEN POS,
What he means is that, speaking in a general way, this instruction on the Steps
to Buddhahood is one that you could never do without, whether you are
practicing the open or the secret teachings of Buddhism. To put it more
specifically, the Great Fifth of the Dalai Lamas has said,

,SKYES PU CHEN PO'I CHOS LUNGS SNYING PO'I DON,

Everybody talks of it,
The Secret Word, The Most Profound,
Essential thread
In the River of Dharma
For those of the great capacity;
But try it before
Your mind is trained
In the path that both them share,

Climb atop a mighty elephant
Still wild, and not yet tamed;
You will only lose
Yourself.18

,ZHES GSUNGS PA LTAR GSANG SNGAGS KYI SGOR 'JUG BAR 'DOD PA RNAMS KYIS SNGON DU LAM THUN MONG BAS RGYUD SBYANG BA 'DI HA CANG GAL CHE BA YOD,
It is absolutely vital then, for anyone with hopes of entering the door that leads
to the way of the Secret Word, that you train your mind first in this path
shared by both the open and secret teachings.

Now there is a reason why this text is known as "Begging for a Mountain of
Blessings." As we recite it we are entreating our Lama to grant us, in one big
pile or mountain, each and every spiritual realization: from finding and
following a spiritual guide as we should, on up to the perfect Union. And we
are asking that he do so in the form of a personal blessing from himself.

The ability to wrap the totality of the teachings into

nothing is not a teaching.19

He has said as well that:
His wondrous word is all three the collections,
Advice adorned by teachings of three scopes,
A gold and jewel rosary of the Keepers,
Meaningful to all who read its beads.20

Geshe Tonpa is describing here what our Lord Lama has spoken in all his
presentations of the Steps of the path, both the brief and more detailed: that
these very Steps are far superior to every other form of instruction, by virtue
of their three extraordinary qualities, and four different kinds of greatness.21
They contain each and every crucial point in the three collections, which are
the entire teachings of the Buddha. They are the single crossroads where all
the 84,000 massive stores of the Dharma intersect,22
they are the one single way
by which each and every victorious Buddha has travelled, or travels now, or
ever again will travel. As the shorter Gem of Fine Qualities says it,

,RGYAL BA 'DAS DANG MA BYON DA LTAR GANG BZHUGS PA,
,KUN LAM PHA ROL PHYIN PA 'DI YIN GZHAN MA YIN,

It is this perfection, nothing else,
which is the path that's shared
By all the Victors, stay they in
the past, the present, or the future.23

People like you and I can go to great Lamas all we want, and receive from
them high initiations, or special oral transmissions, and teachings on texts or
the like. We can claim to have studied the five great classics,24
and plumbed
them to their depths, it doesn't matter. But if in the end we are unable to put
these Steps into practice within our own lives, joining them all into one, then
there's a risk that we'll end up as the Great Fifth described it:

,MI SHES BLUN PO TSE 'DI'I DON GYI CHED,
,MI DGE'I LAS LA 'JUG PA BDEN MOD KYI,
,KHO BO GSUNG RAB MANG PO THOS BZHIN DU,
,GTAN 'DUN RLUNG LA BSKUR BA NGO RE GNONG ,
True we see fools
Who know no better,
Doing what's wrong
For things of this life.
But we err worse
Who've studied much
The holiest of words,
And yet still see
Our ultimate hopes
Swept away on the wind.25

So you must turn your learning within, into Dharma: you must take those four
great qualities of the Steps to Buddhahood and apply them to your own heart.

And there is more you should know; verses like those of the Master Translator
of Taktsang:

Elucidation of all
The highest of speech,
Especially the diamond way;
Teachings on all
The secret groups,
Especially the Unsurpassed;
On all the parts
Of both the levels,
Especially the magic body.
The lines beginning from "Diamond Way" refer to the secret teachings of
Buddhism.26

There are as well the words of the Karmapa, Mikyu Dorje, who in the later
part of his life developed for Lord Tsongkapa an extraordinary level of
admiration, a kind that is found among those of high intelligence, who follow
the Dharma not out of faith, but rather out of reason. The lines read in part:
I make this praise
To the tradition of
The Mount of the Heaven of Bliss;
To Tsongkapa,
For in these days
When the vast majority
Of those in our Northern Land
Act only wrong
With the teachings of the Victors,
He instead has wiped
And cleaned away the dirt on them,
Ever faultlessly.27

That highest of Victors, Kelsang Gyatso, has said too:

It is a pure tradition,
The lineage of the Heaven of Bliss;
It is no biased
Or limited school of thought.
It is the essential nectar,
To learn and practice the Teaching
So all the open and secret Word
Seems personal instruction.28

And that's just the way it is: our scriptural tradition, that of the Mount of the
Heaven of Bliss, is one that is totally complete and spotless, on both sides--in
the open and the secret Word. It is a kind of teaching that is found nowhere
else. And it possesses a multitude of unique and unrivalled qualities: its
depth, the speed with which it works, and so on. Thus it is that this teaching
on the Steps of the Path to Buddhahood, as it was inaugurated by the Gentle
Protector, Tsongkapa, looks to contain a nearly limitless number of spiritual
advices found in none of the other schools, nor even among the older Keepers
of the Word.29

Could any system be more profound or far-reaching than this Dharma, the
Steps of the Path? Certainly not those teachings that others claim are
oh-so-deep, or oh-so-high and inscrutable. People chatter about attaining some
realization, some supposed zenith of some very secret way: they talk of
termination; they talk about the levels of creation and completion; about the
channels and winds and drops; the great seal, or the great completion,
whatever.30
But if one never makes use of these very Steps, he can never even
plant the seeds, much less bring the path in full to grow within his mind.

This then is why it is so very important to go through the Steps, in the three
stages of learning, and contemplating, and meditating upon them. So it is too
that I shall now present you, said our Lama, with just a very brief explanation
and oral transmission of the work known as the "Source of All My Good," for
it contains within it the complete heart of the Steps of the Path to Buddhahood.
II. How to Take a Lama

The text of the Source of All My Good may be divided into four different parts:
1) the very root of the path, which is how to take a
Lama and serve him or her properly;
2) how to train your mind, once you have taken a Lama;
3) a request so that you can attain all the favorable
conditions for succeeding in the path, and stop
all the circumstances that might prevent you
from doing so; and then finally

4) a prayer that in all your future lives you may be
taken under the care of a Lama, and so gain the
strength to reach the final end of the various
levels and paths.

The first of these is presented in a single verse, the first one of the work:
(1)
The source of all my good
Is my kind Lama, my Lord;
Bless me first to see
That taking myself to him
In the proper way
Is the very root
Of the path, and grant me then
To serve and follow him
With all my strength and reverence.

This Step of taking a Lama is itself divided into two sections: developing clear
faith in him, which is the very root of the Path; and then building up reverence
for him, by considering the great kindness he has paid us. The instruction in
developing faith comes in two stages: how to follow a Lama in one's thoughts,
and then how to follow him in one's actions.

Now the Secret Teaching of Sambhuta says,
You will never be able to take a boat

Even if you perfect yourself
In every other respect.31

Take themselves to a spiritual guide

There is a single key
For finding a perfect start to reach
Your every wish, both happiness
In the short run and ultimately;
And the highest words ever spoken
Speak it always the same:
It is your Lama.

And so you must devote yourself
To meditation upon him,
Upon the essence of all

And the Lama that we are describing here is not just any one you might
happen to come across; it's not just anyone they call a "Lama." Rather, he must
have in him the ten high qualities described in the Jewel of the Sutras. He must
first of all be subdued, at peace, and at high peace; that is to say, he must
possess all three of the trainings.33
He must display fine spiritual qualities that
exceed those of his student, and exhibit exceptional effort. He should have a
total mastery of the Dharma in the form of scripture, and should have realized
suchness. He should be highly skilled in teaching the Dharma, he must have
a great love for his disciples, and he must never become tired or discouraged
in his teaching, no matter how much or how often he is called upon to do so.

We are though now in the days of degeneration, and so perhaps it is difficult
to find someone who possesses each and every one of these qualifications. In
such a case, we must follow the advice of the Lord of Lamas:
If you take my advice,
Man of the land of Gyalkam,
Take yourself to the ultimate
Spiritual guide:
To one who grasps Reality,
To one who has controlled his senses,
Who takes your heart away
As soon as you lay your eyes on him;
To the one that,
When you follow what he teaches,
The good in you begins to flower,
And the bad begins to fade.34

These and other such lines are telling us that the Lama we seek must at least
possess a complete set of five different qualities: He must have brought his
mind under control, by following the three trainings; he must have realized
thusness; and He must have love.

As a bare minimum, the Lama must surely fit the following description. He
must occupy himself more with the Dharma than with the things of the world.
He must as well occupy himself more with the concerns of the future life, than
with those of the present one. He must occupy himself more with helping
others, than with helping himself. He is never careless in what he does, or
says, or thinks. And, finally, he never leads his disciples along a path which
is mistaken.

Suppose you are able to find a Lama like the one we have described above.
What are the benefits you can expect from following him properly? Simply
put, you will win each and every good thing in this and all your future lives.
What are the dangers of refusing to follow him, or of following him less than
properly? You will undergo a great mass of unendurable pain, in both the
short term and the long. You must seek to grasp these facts fully.

Your Lama is like the source, he is like the very root, from which every single
good quality of all the different levels and paths of both the open and secret
teachings spring. If you ever succeed in stopping a single personal fault, it will
be because of him. If you ever manage to cultivate a single spiritual quality,
any good at all, that too will come from him. The whole range of virtues, from
the final attainment of secret Union on down to having a single wholesome
thought, all flow from him.

Your Lama is also the one and only "source" in the sense of being the
embodiment or actuality of all the mighty deeds, all the great good, that all the
victorious Buddhas perform in their holy actions, words, and thoughts. Try
now to develop this root of the path--clear faith in him or her.

If with eyes made clear by this faith you begin to see your Lama as a real
Buddha, then the blessing of a real Buddha will follow in your mind-stream.
It's essential therefore that you train your mind in the relevant parts described
in the texts on the Steps: the reasons why you should see that your Lama is a
Buddha; the reasons why you can see that your Lama is a Buddha; how to see
him, and so on.

The word "kind" in the verse here is meant to convey the Step of building up
reverence for your Lama by considering all the kind things he has done for
you. The word "Lord" is a translation of the Sanskrit word Svami, a word that
applies to someone who is like a crowning jewel which all the beings of the
universe, including the great worldly beings of power, humbly place above
their heads.

What does it mean to "follow your Lama properly?" You must understand that
it means to surrender yourself completely to him or her. Here you should take
yourself to him in the way of an obedient child, and with the rest of the nine
attitudes described in the Arrangement of Trunks.35

To put it briefly, you must absolutely conduct yourself correctly in this regard;
you must follow precisely every one of the classical descriptions of how to find
and follow a Lama. If the cornerstone of a house--the walls of its
foundation--are solid, then the house itself is solid. If the roots of a tree are
planted firmly in the soil, then the branches and fruit and all the rest grow
strong.

What we hope to grow is the path, in its entirety: all the Steps from
recognizing the importance of the spiritual leisure and fortune of our present
circumstances, on up to the attainment of secret Union itself. We must find
sure and solid knowledge, we must see, that taking ourselves to our Lama
properly will bring all of this about, without any difficulty at all.

The entire subject of how to follow your Lama in your thoughts is revealed in
the words "first to see." Thus you must come to see your spiritual Friend as
a real Buddha; and this brings us to how you should follow him in your
actions.

How can we please our Lama? Relative to the path which is shared, you
should use the instructions found in the discussions on how to find and follow
a Lama in general. Relative to the way of the secret Word, use the instructions
in the Fifty Verses on Lamas.36
Both of these describe how you should, to the
very best of your ability, "with all your strength," gladly take up any difficult
task in any of the three doors of expression--of body, speech, or mind--in
order to please him or her.

There are different levels of how we pay homage to our Lama: to offer him or
her gifts, material things; to give ourselves up to his service, his honor; and to
take what he has taught us and put it into actual practice, accomplishing our
spiritual goals. Each of these is higher than the one before it, and the last one
is supreme.

And as you serve your Lama, remember. When a farmer goes to plant his
seeds, whatever work he does in the field, he does for his own sake. It's not
as if he is doing the field a favor. Here I am the same. It's me who hopes to
reach freedom from pain, and the state of knowing all things. To do so, I must
take up certain things and give up others; but I am like a man who is blind--I
am totally ignorant of which of these things are which.

And I am not to view this service as if I were laboring for someone else; on the
contrary, I should not even see it as a burden, but rather as a reward: it is my
great good fortune to have the opportunity. And so I must succeed in serving
him or her in both my thoughts and actions, with the deepest feelings of
reverence.

If our service of our Lama is good, then in all our future lives we will find
ourselves taken under the care of Lamas. Then too we can count the life we
have found now as the first in a long and unbroken series of lives in which we
enjoy each of the eight spiritual leisures, and the ten fortunes. And there will
never again be any mistake in this particular arithmetic: we will always enjoy
the exact number of circumstances needed to follow our practice of the
Dharma, and so finally reach the state of perfect enlightenment.

The words "bless me" here mean "embellish me"; which is to say, "transform
the condition of my mind." A minute ago my mind was twisted wrong, and
joined with every kind of bad thought. Now, in the very next moment, may
I be blessed with the good fortune of being able to find and follow my Lama
properly, with every reverence; may my mind be straightened, and become
filled with each and every Step of the path. This is the thing I ask, my Lama.
The explanation of the words "bless me" here applies as well to each of the
other verses in which they appear.

Notes to Reading Eight
*The presence of an asterisk after a translated proper name indicates that the
equivalent Asian-language form or forms may be found in a special appendix.
1
Opening Your Eyes: The edition used for this translation is a woodblock print
of 27 folios on handmade Tibetan paper held in the private collection of the
venerable Geshe Lobsang Thardo, from the Gyalrong College of Sera Mey
Tibetan Monastic University, South India. The copy was presented to him
personally by the Third Pabongka Rinpoche, the Ven. Geshe Lobsang Tupten
Trinley Kunkyab. Another copy is listed in the catalog to the library of His
Holiness Trijang Rinpoche, the late tutor of the present Dalai Lama. The text
is somewhat rare, and was not included in the standard edition of Pabongka
Rinpoche's collected works.
2
the Good and Glorious Pabongka: Refers to the first Pabongka Rinpoche (1878-
1941), whose full monk's name was Jampa Tenzin Trinley Gyatso. He was the
foremost Buddhist teacher of his era, and renowned for his ability to convey
the deepest concepts of Buddhism to the common man in popular public
teachings. For a full biography in English, refer to the introduction of The
Principal Teachings of Buddhism.
3
Source of All My Good: Written by Tsongkapa the Great (1357-1419), perhaps
the greatest commentator of Buddhism who ever lived, author of some 10,000
pages in explanation of the early classics of Buddhism, and teacher of many
eminent disciples, including the First Dalai Lama. This brief work covers all
the necessary stages of the entire path to Buddhahood and is often recited at
the beginning of important teachings and high secret rituals. It also forms the
final section of Necklace for the Fortunate, a popular text used in readying
oneself for a Buddhist meditation session.
As will be explained in more detail further on, the text of the Source of All My
Good is found within a longer work, entitled Open Door to the Highest Path.
This piece is a supplication to the Lamas of the great lineages of Buddhism: the
masters through whom concepts such as the Wish for enlightenment, and the
vision of emptiness, have been passed down to us. The importance of the Door
is indicated by the fact that it appears first in a compendium of 135 briefer
titles within the Master's collected works.
The name and role of the work have evolved over the centuries. Je Tsongkapa
composed the Door in 1402, and by the time of the famous Path of Ease, a
presentation on the Steps of the path by His Holiness the First Panchen Lama
(1567?-1662), it is recommended under its original name for a petition and
visualization of the lineage Lamas.

By the middle part of the 18th century the Door's central section, itself a concise
yet complete presentation of the Steps, has become the subject of a number of
philosophical commentaries, under the name of the Source of All My Good (a
phrase taken from the first line of the text). By this time too, the work is being
referred to by the name of Begging for a Mountain of Blessings. It is also
recommended throughout this period as a component in the six standard
practices used to prepare for a meditation session.
Other commentaries or works based on the Source include those of the
following authors:
Akuching Drungchen Sherab Gyatso (b. 1803)
Gelong Yeshe Gyeltsen
Gushri Kachupa Mergen Kenpo Lobsang Tsepel (b.
about 1760)
Gyal Kenpo Drakpa Gyeltsen (1762-1837)
His Holiness the Sixth Panchen Lama, Lobsang
Tupten Chukyi Nyima (1883-1937)
Je Lodro Gyatso (1851 1930), ed. by Gyal Kentrul
Kelsang Drakpa Gyatso (b. 1880)
Jikme Samten (19th century)
Kalka Damtsik Dorje (18th century)
Kirti Lobsang Trinley (1849-1905)
Lumbum Sherab Gyatso (1884-1968)
Ngawang Yeshe Tupten Rabjampa (19th century)
Shangton Tenpa Gyatso Pel Sangpo (n.d.)
Shasana Dipam (n.d.), probably
Tsechokling Yeshe Gyeltsen (1713-1793)
Explanations of the six preliminary practices are also a rich source of
commentary upon the Source. Pabongka Rinpoche himself gives a profound
interpretation of the text in two such works. He includes all the original verses
in a recitation text based on the Fifth Dalai Lama's text on the Steps. He also
mentions using them as the basis of a review meditation in his masterpiece on
the Steps to Buddhahood entitled A Gift of Liberation, Placed into Our Hands.
And it was his own precious teacher, Dakpo Lama Jampel Hlundrup, who
attached the work to the Necklace mentioned above.
Other commentaries on the six practices which include explanations of the
Source have been written by the following masters:
Akya Yangchen Gaway Lodru (c. 1760)
Keutsang Lobsang Jamyang Monlam (b. 1689)
Tsechok Ling Yeshe Gyeltsen (1713-1793)
The Second Jamyang Shepa, Konchok Jikme
Wangpo (1728-1791)

One very interesting additional work is another Open Door to the Highest Path,
written by Tsechok Ling Yeshe Gyeltsen (1713-1793). The title is the same as
that of Je Tsongkapa's original piece because the author undertakes to extend
Tsongkapa's supplication to the lineage Lamas, in order to include the great
teachers beginning from Je Tsongkapa himself.
Incidentally, the very expression "source of all my good" (in the Tibetan form
of yon-tan gyi gzhi-rten) is used very early on in Buddhist literature. The
phrase in Sanskrit appears in the Letter to a Friend, written by the realized
being Nagarjuna some seventeen centuries ago. Here it refers to the practice
of morality which, like proper reliance upon a Lama, acts to provide us with
all good things.
4
Three doors: The three ways in which one can express himself--in action,
speech, or thought. A typical presentation of the three appears in the works
on Higher Knowledge (Abhidharma); see for example Chone Lama Drakpa
Shedrup (1675-1748).
5
The person who is the Essence of Great Bliss: Another name for Pabongka
Rinpoche, describing his mastery of the secret teachings of Buddhism. The
additional names that follow indicate that the Rinpoche embodies Je
Tsongkapa, Shakyamuni Buddha, and the form that Lord Buddha takes to
deliver the secret Word.
6
Mountain of Blessings: The concept of a blessing in Buddhism refers to a
specific process through which a disciple's ability to achieve spiritual goals is
altered, enhanced, through a true request to a Lama for his or her blessing.
Pabongka Rinpoche himself describes this in his famed Gift of Liberation.
7
"Language of pleasure beings..." These and the other lines belong to selected
verses which recited by tradition at the start of a major teaching, in order for
both teacher and listener to begin with the proper motivation; to formally
request the teaching; to prevent obstacles that might disrupt the teaching; and
so on.
The verses can be found in standard prayer books for Tibetan Buddhist
monasteries. Their locations here are as follows: Essence of Wisdom (the famous
Heart Sutra, for preventing obstacles); Angel with the Face of a Lion (also for
preventing obstacles); "Virtues perfected" (opening lines of Je Tsongkapa's brief
Stages of the Path and an obeisance to Lord Buddha); "Loving One" (these and
following common verses of obeisance and the offering of bathing to the
lineage Lamas); "Gentle Voice,"; "The one of great compassion,"; "Teaching
what to learn, to reach,"; "Founder from the Land of Snows,"; "All three places"
(these last two also common graces); "The constellations,"; "In all my lives"
(also attached to the Mountain of Blessings); "The great Earth" (the shorter
offering of the mandala); "Atop a lion throne" (from a prayer of devotion to Je

Tsongkapa); "Sponges of the sky" (a request for teaching from the famous
Offering to Lamas); "Idam guru" (final words of the mandala offering); "To the
Buddha" (the well-known formula for taking refuge and developing the wish
for enlightenment); "Pleasure beings" (an obeisance to Tara, the Angel of
Liberation); and "Language of pleasure beings" (a prayer to teach in all the
world's languages.)
8
This life of spiritual leisure: Found in the Master's Songs of My Spiritual Life.
9
Four forces: Buddhism teaches that there are four antidote forces, which
together can remove the power or karma of any bad deed. The "basis" force
consists of thinking who it is that was offended by your deed, and who it is
you will rely on to clear yourself of it. The "destruction" force is an intense
feeling of shame and regret for the deed, which will certainly return to hurt
you. The "reverse" force is to turn yourself away from doing that kind of deed
again. The "counteragent" force is to undertake some spiritual
practice--confession, meditation, or any good deed--to offset the power of the
wrong.
10
Three extraordinary trainings: That is, extraordinary morality, extraordinary
concentration, and extraordinary wisdom. Each one acts as a support for the
next. A thorough discussion of the three is found in the monastic textbooks
on the perfection of wisdom; see for example the "Overview of the Perfection
of Wisdom" by Kedrup Tenpa Dargye (1493-1568).
11
Even a cow knows how: The quotation is from the Letter to a Student, written
in the tenth century. It appears as well in Je Tsongkapa's greater Steps to the
Path and the first Panchen Lama's Path of Ease.
12
The sea is not my problem: The quotation is found in a teaching of the Buddha,
where he recounts the story of a serpentine king, as an admonition to his
monks for quarreling. The popular lines are also found in the Greater Steps of
Je Tsongkapa; the Path of Ease by the First Panchen Lama (1567?-1662); the
Word of Gentle Voice by the Fifth Dalai Lama (1617-1682); and the Steps of the
Teaching, a massive prototype for the Greater Steps composed by Geshe
Drolungpa (c. 1100).
13
A kindness returned: This appears to be a proverb rather than a scriptural
reference; the Steps of the Teaching expresses a very similar sentiment.
14
Both of the ultimate goals: Refers to the final culmination of one's own goals
and the ability to help others achieve theirs--two qualities possessed only by
a Buddha. Several important discussions of the ultimate goals are found in
treatises on Master Dharmakirti's Commentary on Valid Perception, composed in
the 7th century. The first is included in the explanation of the opening lines
of this work itself, where the Buddha's qualities are extolled. The second

comes in the second chapter, as Master Dharmakirti explains the praise of the
Buddha in Master Dignaga's original treatise.
15
one of those foe destroyers: "Foe destroyer" is a term used to refer to those who
have achieved nirvana, since--as Geshe Drolungpa notes in his Steps of the
Teaching--they have permanently destroyed the foe of the mental afflictions.
"Listeners" and "self-made Buddhas" here refer to persons who have achieved
nirvana but have not yet entered the higher way, the way of the bodhisattvas,
where they work to become fully enlightened Buddhas in order to liberate all
living beings.
"Listeners" are so called because they can listen to the teachings of the higher
way, and even relate them to others, but do not actually put them into practice
themselves. "Self-made buddhas" are not real Buddhas, but have only achieved
nirvana, and are "self-made" only insofar as they have reached this state
without relying on a spiritual teacher in the present life, although they have
had countless such teachers in their past lives.
16
The great monastery of Radreng: The chain of events surrounding the
composition of the Mountain of Blessings are extraordinary; they show how this
brief supplication played a pivotal role in Je Tsongkapa's spiritual life, and in
the history of Buddhist literature.
Much of what Je Tsongkapa wrote is said to have been dictated to him by
Manjushri, Gentle Voice, who is the wisdom of all enlightened beings
combined in the form of a single angel. Je Tsongkapa began to enjoy
communication with Gentle Voice in his early thirties. At this point he was
still incapable of seeing the angel directly himself, but was able to pose
questions to him through a mediator, a lama named Umapa.
Je Tsongkapa's Secret Biography, a work by his close disciple Kedrup Je (1385-
1438), describes important events of the Master's inner life. Here we read the
details of an early exchange between Je Tsongkapa and Gentle Voice, with
Lama Umapa acting as go-between. Je Rinpoche poses questions, and the
angel begins his answer by clarifying a whole range of thorny issues
concerning the subject of emptiness. Next he moves on to illuminate a number
of difficult points in the secret teachings. Then he pauses, and Je Rinpoche
says: "But wait, there are still more questions I must ask, more points I cannot
grasp."
And Gentle Voice replies,
Do not forget the answers I have already given you
today. Go now and write a record of them. There are
three practices then you must undertake, all three
together, and you must devote yourself to them with
an unquenchable passion.

First you must come to see that your Lama and your
high secret Angel are one and the same. You must
make supplication to them, and try to reach them.
Secondly you must make constant and perfect efforts
in the two-fold practice of collecting the energy of
good deeds, and purifying yourself of the force of evil
deeds.
Thirdly you must use the power of your intellect to
investigate the true meaning of the great books of
Buddhism, and then you must contemplate this
meaning deeply.
Follow these three practices, keep them up over a long
period of time. There will come a day, it is not far off,
when the seed I have planted within you in this hour
will flower. And then you will understand all,
perfectly.
Throughout his life Je Tsongkapa followed all three practices, but the particular
attention he paid to supplication, to prayers for the blessings of perfected
beings, Buddhas and Lamas, is strikingly evident in records of his writings,
and throughout his various biographies.
It is one such supplication which leads to our present work, the Mountain of
Blessings. The time is the summer of 1402, in the forty-sixth year of the
Master's life. Having spent a fruitful summer at the Temple of Ar with his
close teacher and disciple, the Sakya sage Jetsun Rendawa, Je Tsongkapa then
travels to Radreng ("to the north" of Lhasa). He has been there once before,
attracted to the great monastery so full of the history of two of Tibetan
Buddhism's founding fathers: Atisha, the Lord, and his spiritual son Dromton
Je (the "Victor" mentioned in the text). This connection is described by Kedrup
Je in his longer biography.
At Radreng, Je Tsongkapa goes into solitude at the foot of the lion crag.
Above his quarters is a statue of the Lord himself, Atisha. One day the Master
kneels before the image, in keeping with the words of Gentle Voice himself,
and makes a supplication to the Lamas of the past.
The prayer that Je Tsongkapa made that day is still extant, and can be found
in his collected works under the name of Door to the Highest Path. The petition
is directed to the Lamas of the instructions on the Steps to Buddhahood, and
divides broadly into three parts.

The first part is a request to the teachers of the lineage of the Wish for
enlightenment, beginning with the Buddha himself, and continuing on through
Loving One, the Indian master Asanga, and then on down to the great Tibetan
lamas of Je Rinpoche's own time. The third part is a similar prayer, to the
teachers of the lineage of the Realization of emptiness, again starting with Lord
Buddha, and passing down through Gentle Voice, the incomparable Nagarjuna,
and later generations. The second part, between these two, is none other than
the Mountain of Blessings, the Source of All My Good.
Je Tsongkapa ends his prayer, and suddenly goes into a vision, one which,
according to the Great Biography of Gyalwang Lobsang Trinley Namgyal (about
1830), continues on and off for an entire month. He sees all the lineage Lamas
face-to-face, and receives a momentous boon from one in particular.
The scene is recorded in a standard set of fifteen scroll paintings of the
Master's life known as The Tsongkapa Eighty. We find the following description
of the event on the scroll in the works of the great Jamyang Shepay Dorje
(1648-1721):
And the Lord Atisha came to the Master, and placed
his hand on his head, and said to him, "Do mighty
deeds on behalf of the Teachings, and then I myself
will assist you in reaching the goal of Enlightenment,
and filling the needs of every sentient being."
Immediately after the vision, Je Tsongkapa is approached by scores of learned
disciples, who entreat him to write a detailed account of how to reach
perfection. Flush with Lord Atisha's promise, the Master goes into retreat, and
there at Radreng completes his masterwork--the Lam Rim Chenmo, or Greater
Steps of the Path to Buddhahood--the most famous book in all of Tibetan
Buddhism.
His understanding is now complete, and the seed planted by Gentle Voice has
flowered as foretold, for Je Tsongkapa has heeded the angel's advice by
composing this perfect supplication: the Mountain of Blessings. This power of
the prayer has been recognized throughout generations of lamas since, and
explains why it is used as a preparation for the secret practices. As the final
lines of the present explanation of the work reveal, it too has been imparted by
Pabongka Rinpoche as a preliminary to a tantric initiation.
17
Both the highest paths: Refers to the paths of the open and the secret teachings
of Buddhism. The path which is "shared" by the two consists of the
realizations of the Steps to Buddhahood, since these are necessary for success
in both the open and the secret ways. The quotation is from Je Rinpoche's
Briefer Steps of the Path.

18
You will only lose yourself: Original source of quotation not found. The Fifth
Dalai Lama, His Holiness Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso (1617-1682), was an
extraordinary scholar and organizer of Buddhism, so much so that he is
referred to in Tibet simply as the "Great Fifth." He is known for bringing the
famous Potala Palace to its present form; for his writings on a broad range of
philosophical and secular subjects; and for his special visions and mastery of
the secret teachings.
19
Nothing is not a teaching: The line is found in a work entitled Selections from
Dromton Je, which at this point is quoting single lines by Dromton Je that
appear in the Greater Steps of Je Tsongkapa. Here and in the Gift of Pabongka
Rinpoche the quotation is used to emphasize how practitioners at an advanced
level see all the Buddhist teachings as being totally consistent internally.
None of these three occurrences of the line includes the part beginning with
"for the Father," nor is it found in the quotation as found in the text on the
Steps by the Great Fifth Dalai Lama. The sense though matches the context of
the Selections and the standard use of the reference.
The words translated here as "wrapping the totality of the teachings into one"
can be read in a number of different ways, as noted by Pabongka Rinpoche
himself in the Gift," at the folios listed above. Literally the text speaks of
"carrying all the teachings as a square," which the Rinpoche interprets finally
as referring to how a square Tibetan carpet automatically comes with four
corners. That is, any teaching on the Steps of the path automatically contains
in it all the teachings of the Buddha, providing an abbreviated presentation
that any one of us can use to achieve total enlightenment.
The great Drom Tonpa (1005-1064), full name Dromton Gyalway Jungne, was
the most famed disciple of Lord Atisha (982-1052), himself the illustrious
progenitor of the teaching on the Steps in Tibet. Drom Tonpa also founded the
great monastery of Radreng, which is where Je Tsongkapa wrote the Mountain
of Blessings.
20
A gold and jewel rosary: Original source of quotation not found; it also occurs
in Pabongka Rinpoche's commentary to the Three Principal Paths.
The "three scopes" refer to three levels of motivation for practicing the Steps
of the path: to escape the three lower rebirths, to escape all suffering, and to
achieve total enlightenment in order to help all living beings. The "three
collections" are the three sections of the Buddha's word: the "collection of
vowed morality," dedicated chiefly to the training of morality; the "collection
of sutra," concerned primarily with the training of concentration; and the
"collection of higher knowledge," devoted to the training of wisdom. See
Pabongka Rinpoche's Gift of Liberation, and Kedrup Tenpa Dargye's Overview
of the Perfection of Wisdom.

The "Keepers" are explained below at note 29.
21
These Steps are far superior: Pabongka Rinpoche himself, in A Gift of Liberation,
describes the "three extraordinary qualities" as follows. The works on the Steps
to the path are (1) totally complete, with nothing left out, for they present in
a concise way the entire contents of the teachings of the Buddha, both open
and secret. They are (2) easily put into practice, for their main point is to
explain the various steps for taming the mind. Finally, they are (3) vastly
superior to other teachings, since they consist of the systems of the two great
founders--Arya Nagarjuna and Master Asanga--enhanced by the instructions
of Lama Vidyakokila and Lama Serlingpa, respectively.
Arya Nagarjuna (200 AD) is known as the founder of the teachings on
emptiness, and Master Asanga (350 AD) as that of the teachings on bodhisattva
activities. The lineages come down respectively to Lama Vidyakokila and
Lama Serlingpa, and then combine in their illustrious student, Lord Atisha
(982-1054). The Lord's full name is Dipamkara Shri Jnyana; it was he who
brought the teachings of the Steps of the path to Tibet, and who authored the
Lamp for the Path, a prototype text of this genre.
The "four kinds of greatness" also appear in Pabongka Rinpoche's Gift. The
teachings on the Steps of the path are great in that (1) they allow a person to
realize that every single teaching of Buddhism is consistent with every other
one. They bring a person to a level where (2) he or she sees everything the
Buddha taught as something that can be put into personal practice. They (3)
help a person to discern with ease the true intention of the Buddha in each of
his teachings, and thereby (4) automatically protect you from making the Great
Mistake; that is, the error of thinking that some of the Buddha's instructions are
better, and some worse.
22
Massive stores of the Dharma: By tradition the Buddha taught 84,000 huge
collections of scripture, one collection for each of the different variants of our
mental afflictions and harmful habits. There are a number of different
positions on the exact quantity of the teachings contained in each of these
collections; the view of the greater way is that each such collection consists of
the number of pages one could write with the amount of ink that the great
mythical elephant named Rabten could carry on his back. See the First Dalai
Lama's commentary to the Treasure House of Knowledge.
23
It is this perfection: The verse is found in the Shorter Sutra on the Perfection of
Wisdom. It is generally considered the ultimate origin of the expression "Steps
of the path", and is quoted by Je Tsongkapa in his Greater Steps, as well as in
Pabongka Rinpoche's own masterpiece on the Steps, and commentary to the
Three Principal Paths.

24
The five great classics: These are the five great books of early Indian Buddhism
studied and debated in major Tibetan monasteries even in Je Tsongkapa's time.
As mentioned throughout his Great Biography, they are the Jewel of Realizations
brought from Loving One by Master Asanga (335 AD); Entering the Middle Way,
by Master Chandrakirti (650 AD); Treasure House of Knowledge, by Master
Vasubandhu (335 AD); Abbreviation of Vowed Morality, by Master Gunaprabha
(500 AD?); and Commentary on Valid Perception, by Master Dharmakirti (630
AD).
25
Swept away on the wind: Original source of quotation not found. The "Great
Fifth", as mentioned above in note 18, refers to His Holiness the Fifth Dalai
Lama.
26
Especially the magic body: The Master Translator of Taktsang, Sherab Rinchen
(b. 1405), was one of the foremost scholars of the Sakya tradition of Tibetan
Buddhism. The lines appear as well in Pabongka Rinpoche's Gift of Liberation,
and in the famed Survey of the Schools of Philosophy by Tuken Lobsang Chukyi
Nyima (1737-1802).
The lines beginning from "diamond way" refer to the secret teachings of
Buddhism.
27
Ever faultlessly: Mikyu Dorje (1507-1554) was the Eighth Karmapa, spiritual
head of the Karma Kagyu lineage of Tibetan Buddhism, and wrote on a wide
range of topics.
28
It is a pure tradition: Gyalwang Kelsang Gyatso (1708-1757) was the Seventh
of the Dalai Lamas. The lines quoted here appear among a group of mental
trainings found in his collected works.
29
The older Keepers of the Word: Refers to the Kadampas, an inspired group of
scholars and meditators from the early days of Buddhism in Tibet, dating from
the eleventh century. Their name literally means "those for whom every single
letter of the teachings (ka) turns to instructions (dampa) immediately relevant
to personal practice." The followers of the tradition of Tsongkapa--the Gelukpa
or Way of Virtue, lineage of the Heaven of Bliss--are sometimes called the
"later Keepers of the Word."
30
The great completion: This and some of the other practices mentioned are all
details of the secret teachings of Buddhism.
31
Perfect yourself: Original quotation not found; neither does it appear to be in
the secret teachings of Samputa, despite the similarity of the title.
32
Ask Him, for all your goals: The lines are found in a letter of advice from Je
Tsongkapa to one Yonten Gyatso of the district of Tulung, Tibet.

33
All three of the trainings: These are the exceptional trainings of morality,
concentration, and wisdom. The original quotation is from the Jewel of
Maitreya. The importance of the qualifications of the Lama is indicated by the
fact that the same words are quoted in works like the Greater Steps of Je
Tsongkapa; the First Panchen Lama's Path of Ease; Pabongka Rinpoche's own
Gift of Liberation, and his commentary to the Three Principal Paths.
34
The good begins to flower: The lines are found in an extraordinary letter of
advice written by Je Tsongkapa to himself, where he poses numbered
questions, and then answers them in the form of profound instruction. It is
interesting to note that this is the final work in a large collection of shorter
pieces by the Master; the first title is the Mountain of Blessings itself, which
brings us full circle.
35
The nine attitudes: The nine are mentioned in Je Tsongkapa's Greater Steps,
and are listed fully in the First Panchen Lama's Path of Ease. The original sutra
subsumes two volumes of the canon and includes repeated, exquisite
descriptions of these and similar attitudes to develop towards one's Lama.
The nine attitudes taught in the sutra are as follows:
1) Like an obedient child, give up your own will and
submit yourself to your Lama.
2) Like a diamond, be solid in your devotion to Him or
Her, and let no relative or friend come between
you.
3) Like the earth itself, accept any task your Lama may
load upon you.
4) Like the great mountains at the edge of the world, stay
unshakable in your service, regardless of any
troubles that come.
5) Like a handservant, carry out any task He or She gives
you, never seeking to avoid it, no matter how
distasteful it may seem.
6) Like the dust of the earth, seek the lowest position,
giving up all pride, all pretension, all conceit.
7) Like a sturdy vehicle, undertake any burden your Lama
may give you, however heavy.
8) Like a loyal dog, stay without anger, regardless of how

your Lama might berate or scold you.
9) No matter how much you have to go here and there in
the service of your Lama, be willing to go, like a
boat that never complains.

Reading Nine: Getting the Essence of Life
III. Advice to Take the Essence of Life

GNYIS PA BSTEN NAS BLO JI LTAR SBYANG BA'I TSUL LA GNYIS, DAL 'BYOR LA SNYING PO BLANG BA'I PHYIR BSKUL BA DANG , SNYING PO JI LTAR LEN PA'I TSUL LO, DANG PO NI,
This brings us to the second major part of the text itself, which describes how
to train the mind, once you have properly taken a Lama. This part comes in
two Steps: urgent advice to take the essence of the present life, with its
spiritual leisure and fortune; and a description of just how to take this essence.
The first step is contained in the single verse that follows next:

,LAN CIG RNYED PA'I DAL BA'I RTEN BZANG 'DI,
,SHIN TU RNYED DKA' DON CHEN SHES GYUR NAS,
,NYIN MTSAN KUN TU SNYING PO LEN PA'I BLO,

(2)
Bless me first to realize
That the excellent life
Of leisure I've found
Just this once
Is ever so hard to find
And ever so valuable;

Grant me then
To wish, and never stop to wish,
That I could take
Its essence night and day.

LAN CIG RNYED CES PA PHYIN CHAD YANG YANG MI RNYED PA'I DON DANG ,
The phrase about finding a life like this "just this once" is meant to indicate
that we would never be able to find this kind of life on a regular basis in the
future.

'DIR DAL 'BYOR NGOS BZUNG BA'I SKABS, DAL 'BYOR RTEN ZHES MA GSUNGS BAR DAL BA'I RTEN ZHES GSUNGS PA'I RGYU MTSAN, NGAN SONG GSUM DANG LHA TSE RING PO, KLA KLO, LOG LTA CAN, LKUG PA, RGYAL BA 'JIG RTEN DU MA BYON PA'I DUS SU SKYES PA STE MI KHOM PA BRGYAD DANG BRAL BA'I DAL BA BRGYAD DNGOS SU TSANG LA,
You may wonder too why, at a point where the concepts of spiritual leisure
and fortune are being presented, the verse says only "life of leisure," and not
"life of leisure and fortune." The point is that we actually do possess the entire
set of eight spiritual leisures, which consist of being free of the eight ways that
a person can lack opportunity. These lacks of opportunity are birth in the
three lower realms,37
or as a long-life being of pleasure; as a barbarian; as a
person with a mistaken worldview; as someone who is handicapped; or in a
period of history when the victorious Buddha has yet to appear in the world.

,MI NYID DBUS SKYES DBANG PO TSANG ,
,LAS MTHA' MA LOG GNAS LA DAD,
We do have all five of the spiritual fortunes that relate to one's self, as
described in the following verse:
Born as a human,
In a central land,
And having one's faculties
All complete;
Not lost to the last of karma,
And feeling faith for the place.38

,CES PA LTAR DGE SLONG PHA MA, DGE BSNYEN PHA MA BCAS STON PA'I 'KHOR RNAM BZHI'AM, GTZO BO DGE SLONG PHA YOD PA'I CHOS TSIGS KYI YUL DBUS SU SKYES SHING ,
Here "born in a central land" refers to a land where there exists the "core of the
Dharma," meaning that there are people in the country who keep the vows of
the "four attendants to the Buddha." This refers to the full ordinations for a
man and a woman, along with the novice ordinations for the same. The main
component of the core is the fully ordained monk.

LAS MTHA' MA LOG PA STE TSE 'DIR MTSAMS MED KYI LAS BSAGS LA MA SBYANGS PA MIN PA DANG ,
"Not lost to the last of karma" means not having collected, and then failed to
clear from oneself, the karma that comes from committing one of the
"immediate," heinous bad deeds.39

The place from where each and every white and good thing grows is the
teaching on discipline; here the word "discipline" can by extension be applied
to the entire contents of the canon--the three collections of scripture--since
they all function to discipline one's mind.40
We do then possess the fortune of
having faith in the holy books.

,SANG RGYAS BYON DANG DAM CHOS STON,
,BSTAN PA GNAS DANG DE RJES 
'JUG,GZHAN PHYIR SNYING NI BRTZE BA'O,
,ZHES PA'I GZHAN 'BYOR LNGA NAS,
Let us examine though whether we have the five fortunes that relate to what
is outside ourselves. The classic reference here is:

The Buddha is come,
And taught the holy Dharma.
The teaching remains,
As do the ones who follow.
There is compassion
For the sake of others.41

SANGS RGYAS BYON TE BZHUGS BZHIN PA DANG , SANGS RGYAS SAM DE'I NYAN THOS KYIS CHOS GSUNGS PA, SANGS RGYAS MYA NGAN LAS MA 'DAS PAR 'BRAS BU'I BSTAN PA GNAS PA, CHOS BSTAN PA DES 'BRAS BU BZHI DNGOS SU THOB PAR MTHONG NAS GDUL BYA GZHAN MA'ANG DE'I RJES SU 'JUG PA   
Here the Buddha must have come and still be present in the world. He or his
direct disciples must be teaching the Dharma. The resulting teachings must
also remain, and this during the period before his final passing beyond all
sorrow. Certain of his disciples must observe other disciples actually achieve
the four results,42
after he has taught them; and these disciples must undertake
to follow the same practices too.

   BZHI DGE SLONG 'CHAR KA LTA BU LA TSANG BA LAS, MGON PO KLU SGRUB LA'ANG DNGOS GNAS PA MTSANG LA, RANG RES KYANG SANGS RGYAS DANG KHYAD MED PA'I BLA MA MJAL TE CHOS GSUNGS PA SOGS KYIS DE DAG DOD THUB SBYOR DU YOD PA LAS DNGOS GNAS MA TSANG YANG , DAL BA BRGYAD DNGOS SU TSANG BA LA GTZO BOR DGONGS TE GSUNGS PA RED,
All four of the fortunes just explained have been possessed even by the likes
of the monk Udayi,43
whereas the same cannot be said even for the Savior
Nagarjuna, who lacked them in their literal form. We too have met our Lamas,
who are no different from a Buddha, and they have spoken the Dharma and
so on; these are a full substitute yes, but we cannot say that we have all those
fortunes in their literal form. We do however enjoy all eight of the spiritual
leisures; these then are our primary advantage, and it's with this fact in mind
that the verse reads "life of leisure."

GZHAN PHYIR SNYING BRTZE ZHES PA, SBYIN BDAG DANG BLA MA SOGS KYIS GANG ZAG GZHAN

What does it mean when the reference says, "There is compassion for the sake
of others?" The "others" here refers to ourselves; our sponsors and Lamas and
other such persons who act for our sake, motivated by compassion, to see that
we are provided with all the conditions that will facilitate our practice of the
Dharma: they give us food, or clothes, and other necessities; They teach us the
Dharma; and so on. Therefore this phrase should be understood as describing
the good fortune to have around us those who give us the things we need to
practice.

So you and I are free of the eight ways in which a person can lack spiritual
opportunity; and yet we fail to work here now, in the days when we do have
a Dharma to practice. We find ourselves locked in the handcuffs of the present
life; we throw ourselves into all sorts of meaningless activities aimed at gaining
material things, or other people's approval, or a taste of fame; we want to fit
into the world's way of life, and so on. These make us so busy that it's almost
as if we have taken special care to invent a ninth way of lacking spiritual
opportunity.

We have here a wonderful life and body of exactly the same kind that holy
persons in the past have used to achieve enlightenment itself; we though use
these things as a big pot in which to stock up our bad deeds. We have turned
our spiritual leisure and fortune into a rich opportunity to suffer.

In order not to lose the good qualities of this life in our future lives, we must
manage to take some special essence of the circumstances we have found, just
this once; we must use this life-time where everything has come together,
where there is not a single piece of the whole incomplete. If we fail in this
endeavor, then it will be extremely difficult for us to find a life of spiritual
leisure and fortune ever again.

Whether you will be able to gain such a life again or not you must judge from
looking within yourself, to see if all the causes of winning the various leisures
and fortunes are there, or not. It's no use to look outside, to see whether or
not there are a lot of human beings around. Humans are one of the six forms
of suffering life, and until all six disappear you will see no end to humans.
There will always be some good number around, but if they lack this
complement of leisure and fortune, a big population will only mean an even
more tremendous amassing of sins. You should take no comfort, said our
Lama, in the fact that there is such an abundant supply of raw material for the
circle of suffering life.

'O NA DAL 'BYOR GYI RGYU JI 'DRA DGOS SHE NA, DAL RTEN RNAM DAG THOB PA'I RGYU LA TSUL KHRIMS RNAM PAR DAG PAS GZHI BZUNG , SBYIN SOGS DRUG GIS GROGS BYAS, SMON LAM DRI MA MED PAS MTSAMS SPYAR BA BCAS DGOS PAS RGYU'I SGO NAS RNYED DKA' BA DANG ,
"Well then," you may ask, "just what is it that causes the leisures and fortunes
to come about?" Attaining the good life, one of spiritual leisure, begins with
morals kept very good. This morality must be joined with giving and the
other five perfections; and the glue that holds it all together is to make the very
purest of prayers. Therefore finding a life like ours is first of all something
difficult because of the causes needed to bring it about.

RANG CAG GIS SDIG PA MI DGE BA LA DUS RTAG TU SPYAD PA 'DI YANG DAL 'BYOR 'THOB PA'I GEGS THU SHOS SHIG YIN PAR MA ZAD, 'DUL BA LUNG GZHI SOGS NAS GSUNGS PA BZHIN NGAN 'GRO GZHAN LAS DUD 'GRO NYUNG , DE LAS MI'I 'GRO BA NYUNG , MI YANG SANGS RGYAS KYI STAN PA DAR BA'I YUL DU SKYE BA NYUNG ,
People like you and I are forever committing non-virtuous deeds, and this is
the single greatest obstacle to our reaching the state of spiritual leisure and
fortune ever again. Beyond this are statements from the Foundation Word on
Vowed Morality, and other texts, which describe how those born as animals are
fewer than those born in one of the other births of misery; those born as
humans are fewer than the animals; and even among humans those born in a
country where the Buddha's teachings have spread are fewer still.44

DE SKYES KYANG CHOS DANG MJAL BA'I RTEN BZANG KHYAD PAR CAN NI RNYED MI SRID PA LTA BU YIN PAS NA, NGO BO'I SGO NAS RNYED DKA',
To be born in such a land, and then go on to actually encounter the Dharma
with a mind and body so very special as the one which we now possess, is an
occurrence which borders on the impossible. This shows how a life like ours
is difficult to find by its very nature as well.

There is yet a third way to show how difficult it is to find a life so opportune
as our own. This involves using a metaphor, such as the following from the
Letter to a Friend:
Suppose a turtle in the sea were to rise
And poke his head right through the hole
Of a wooden ring as it drifted around
The surface of the great salt sea.
The odds of being born a human
As opposed to birth as an animal
Are even more remote; make it come,
Lord of Men, by living holy Dharma.45

Right now we have the time to practice religion. We possess the outer
condition we need to succeed, for we have come into contact with a Lama, a
spiritual Friend who is just like Lord Buddha himself. We also enjoy the inner
condition, since our minds are not defective in any way, and we are endowed

If I truly undertake to do so, it is certain that I can achieve everything from
temporal goals, such as achieving a good and useful kind of birth in the higher
forms of life--among humans or the beings of pleasure--on up to the ultimate
goal of becoming the Keeper of the Diamond himself.46
All this can be achieved because of the extraordinary kind of life I have now
gained; seek to understand this fact, try to truly recognize how significant the
one chance is.

Certain signs will come if you succeed in making yourself aware of your
spiritual leisure and fortune. Think of a man who is completely engrossed,
either in some great good luck, or in some great misfortune. Every time he
wakes up at night these thoughts of happiness or unhappiness well up in him,
vivid and automatic.

What we are requesting from our Lama here is that he bless us to achieve this
same level of obsession: bless me first to realize that the excellent life I've found,
complete with every spiritual leisure, is hard to find and--once found--is ever
so valuable. Now, in the one and only time I have ever managed to win this
diamond body and life, let me think of how the circle of suffering has
absolutely no beginning; how one must normally practice for many millions
of years to reach the state of a Buddha; and other such truths. And grant me
then to wish, and never stop to wish, that I could take this life's essence night and
day: that I could at every given moment keep this precious time from being lost
to actions which are pointless, devoid of any meaning.

This brings us to our description of how actually to take the essence of this life.
This part itself has three; the first is how to train one's mind in the Steps of the
path which are shared with persons of lesser spiritual capacity, and is covered
in the next two verses of the root text:

(3,4)
My body and the life in it
Are fleeting as the bubbles
In the sea froth of a wave.
Bless me first thus to recall
The death that will destroy me soon;
And help me find sure knowledge

That after I have died
The things I've done, the white or black,
And what these deeds will bring to me,
Follow always close behind,
As certain as my shadow.
Grant me then
Ever to be careful,
To stop the slightest
Wrong of many wrongs we do,
And try to carry out instead
Each and every good
Of the many that we may.

And so we have attained this very special kind of life, with its spiritual leisure
and fortune. But my body and the life in it are fleeting, forever changing, and
every passing moment they move inexorably closer to my death.

'CHI RKYEN GLO BUR BA NAD GDON BGEGS RIGS 'BYUNG BZHI'I GNOD PA SOGS KYIS TSE SROG 'PHROG PA LA KHYIS GLUD LA BRNGAMS PA LTAR BSKOR NAS BSDAD YOD CING ,
But that's not all--there are conditions all around me that can strike and kill
me in an instant: things like illness and harmful spirits, sudden disasters,
attacks upon me by the very four elements that make up my own body. They
stand around me ready to snatch away my life, like a pack of dogs circling
around a piece of fresh meat, lusting after it.47

Still more, my body is like a bubble in the sea froth of a wave; it has no power to
resist even some very minor harm: we can see with our own two eyes that
even the prick of a thorn can lead to a person's death.

In sum, my body and life are fragile; so death will destroy me soon. Here you
should use the instructions on your coming death that we find in works like
the longer and briefer presentations of the Steps of the path by our Lord,
Tsongkapa. These sections cover the three principles of death and the nine
reasons for them, along with the three resolutions to be made.48
They show
how our death is certain, and how uncertain we are of when it will come.
When it does, none of the people close to us, nor any of the things we own,
nor anything else of the kind can help us. In the end, not even our body can
be of any assistance.

   YANG DANG YANG DU BSAMS SHING DRAN PA DANG , DE YANG RANG DGAR 'CHI BA LA SKRAG STE BSDAD PAS MI 'ONG ZHING , BU STON THAMS CAD MKHYEN PA'I ZHAL NAS,
Think on these points, recall them, again and again. The object here is not to
reach a point where you sit in some confused terror over the death that's
coming to you. Rather you must come to see that, at the moment of death and
as you take your future life, only the Dharma can help you: everything else
turns useless. Remember the words of the omniscient Buton, who has spoken:

Moving on like an animal

Your plans for today
Your plans for tomorrow
Will never all be filled;
Let go all your thousand plans,
Devote yourself to one.
You will be summoned into
The awesome presence of Lord Death;
The end is lying on your bed,
The breathing stops, the life is gone.
And on this day,
My Rinchen Drup,
Nothing but the Dharma

The master teacher of Bodong, whose name was Jikdrel Chokle Namgyal, has
also said:
The existence of past and future lives can be understood as well
through logical reasoning. If the human body could occur
without any proper cause, then every existing object might just
as well be stuffed full of human bodies. If the human body
could occur without any involvement of previous consciousness
if it could come from physical matter alone then every bit of dirt,
every rock, every mountain and stream might just as well be
stuffed full of human bodies.

For those who deny that life goes on, hearing these lines is like
being struck by a bolt of lightning. There are moreover quite
numerous accounts of many wise and accomplished practitioners
who have used clairvoyance to perceive the past and future lives,
as well as the state between death and rebirth, which they and
others have passed through. There are also cases like those of
the non-Buddhist adepts who attain clairvoyance that allows
them to recall eighty of their different lives.52

Since nothing else can help then, it is essential that we give up on life and be
sure to devote ourselves to death, by practicing some pure form of the
Dharma, as a way to assist our future self. It's not as if, after you and I have
died, the stream of our mind just stops and we turn into nothing. Rather we
have no choice but to take another birth. And there are no more than two
places where we can take that birth: in the higher realms of happiness, or the
lower realms of misery.

DE GNYIS GANG DU SKYE RANG LA RANG DBANG MED PAR 'GRO BA GNYIS KYI RGYU'AM, LAS DKAR NAG GI RJES SU 'GRO DGOS SHING ,
We have absolutely no control over which of the two places we go; we must
follow where we are sent by the separate causes for each place, and these
causes are the things we've done, the white and black, respectively.

Our mental streams contain very, very few of the causes that will take us to a
higher birth; but we have a vast multitude of the causes that will lead us to
one of the births of misery. Right now we are doing both white deeds, and
black deeds: the good and the bad. At the moment of death, the power of one
or the other will be activated, and force us over to our next birth. The seeds
of the deeds which are more plentiful are the kind that are likely to be
activated.

And after we cross over to our new birth, the fair or foul consequences of our
virtue or our evil will follow close behind. These consequences can never go
wrong; good must come from the good, and bad from the bad. They will
attach themselves to my consciousness and pass on to wherever it goes, as
certain as my shadow.

This fact, that pleasure and pain are the respective results of good and evil, is
spoken in the various collections of the immaculate Word of the victorious
Buddhas: in the sutras, in the books of discipline, and so on. They describe
things like how karma is certain to produce similar results; how it multiplies;
how consequences of a karma not committed can never be experienced; and
how the consequences of a karma committed can never just fade away on their
own. It is spoken as well that:

,LUS CAN DAG GI LAS RNAMS NI,

The karma of sentient kind
Never just fades away,

Of millions of years.

And the time is come,
The consequences
Can do nothing but flower.53

Master Bodongwa quotes these same lines from sutra and says,
People like you and I may have blurry eyes but we must look on
this Word of the Buddha as perfectly accurate. If you die, then
die; if you drop from old age, then drop; but if nothing else keep
your trust in the Teacher.54

The thinking behind these lines is expressed in a verse by the Master
Shantideva:
The way karma works
Is beyond comprehension;
Only the All-Knowing
Know it.55

Because of these facts you and I must seek a way to find sure knowledge, where
we recognize the truth of the simply limitless workings of karma and
consequences described by the Teacher. Once we have found this knowledge,
we then understand that the necessary consequence of all the harmful deeds
we have amassed up to now will be for us to pass on to the births of misery
in our next life.

And what of these three lower realms? Think fiercely on their sufferings: the
heat of the molten steel, the cold; the hunger, the thirst, exhaustion and terror;
being unable to talk, living in dark ignorance, eating each other to survive, and
all the rest. It will bring you fear, and from the depths of your heart you will
go for shelter to the ones who can protect you: to the three Jewels.56

If harmful actions provide the causes that push us to these lower realms, then
needless to say we must from this point on avoid doing any of the many wrongs
that we do: those obvious non-virtues that anyone can see are mistaken. We
must also though seek to recognize and abandon even the very slightest harms
we commit; the ones we barely realize that we do.

The most important thing is for us to follow the words of that King of the

We have little time to live,
It's sure we'll not long be here.
Let the world pass the time
Working to feed themselves;
Even the poorest know how.
Those who follow the rules of Dharma
Need not worry,
The knife of hunger

You can't work for the future life

He says as well,
Whether you fill your belly
In this life well or not,
Still you will live on.
What's difficult is
To meet the Dharma
In your future life;
For this life then
Put all your efforts
Only in the Dharma.
If now you cannot do your best
To do what's virtuous,
Be sure that in the life beyond
You will feel only pain.58

And so we have no other choice, if we hope to pass on to one of the better
births in our next life, than to prepare the proper cause; that is, to do the
things we should, and not do what we shouldn't. There are quite nearly a
limitless number of instructions on how to carry this out--to make it easy for
us, the compassionate Teacher provided a guide of what to take up and what
to give up: this then is the list of ten good deeds and ten bad deeds, the
broadest simplification.59

Keeping this morality, of avoiding the ten bad deeds, is just one typical
example of the many different kinds of good that are contained within the
broader and the more subtle instructions on how to go for refuge. We must
engage in each and every one of these virtues by being ever careful--by acting
with proper recollection and watchfulness in every moment of the day.

And we must go further: on every occasion that we train ourselves in these
thoughts, in the Steps which are shared with persons of lesser and medium
capacity, we must do so with the ultimate intent of using them as a foundation
for training ourselves in the path for those of great capacity.
In short, said our Lama, we must understand how to employ these Steps as a
means for developing the Wish for enlightenment. And in these lines we are
requesting our Lama to help us find the ability to do so.

Notes to Reading Nine
37
Three lower realms: According to Buddhism there are six different types of
rebirth. These are birth as a hell-being, a craving spirit, an animal, a human,
one who is nearly a full pleasure being, and a full pleasure being. The first
three types of birth are known as the three lower realms. Pleasure beings
enjoy extremely long lives in a temporary paradise, and then normally fall to
hell after exhausting their good karma. The classic presentation of the six
rebirths is found in the third chapter of the Treasure House of Knowledge, by the
4th-century Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu; a typical commentary would
be that of the First Dalai Lama, Gyalwa Gendun Drup (1391-1474).
38
Born as a human: The classic source for the description of spiritual fortunes
is the Levels of Listeners, one of the major divisions of the Levels of Practitioners,
written by the Indian Buddhist sage Asanga in the fourth century.
39
Immediate bad deeds: Buddhism teaches that there are five misdeeds which are
so evil that they are sure to lead one to a hellbirth in the very next life. The
deeds are, from most serious to least, the following: causing a schism in the
community of monks; attempting to kill a Buddha; killing someone who has
reached nirvana; killing one's mother, and killing one's father. A full
discussion of the five is found in the fourth chapter of Master Vasubandhu's
Treasure House of Wisdom, and in commentaries such as the one by Jampay
Yang of Chim (c. 1280).
40
Discipline one's mind: The collection on discipline, or vowed morality, is
actually only one of the three sections of the original Buddhist canon; the point
is that all the scriptures though teach the absolute importance of moral
behavior. For a description of the three collections see note 20.
41
For the sake of others: Again the original source in prose is Master Asanga's
Levels of Listeners.
42
The four results: The four fruits of the "way of virtue," which in this case
refers to the direct perception of selflessness. The four are to attain the state
of a foe destroyer; of one who need never again take rebirth in this realm of
desire; of one who must take one more rebirth in this realm; and of one who
has "entered the stream"--one who, due to his realization of selflessness, is
clearly headed for freedom. The four are presented for example in the second
and sixth chapters of Master Vasubandhu's Treasure House, with its
commentary by the First Dalai Lama.
43
Even by the likes of the monk Udayi: The monk was one of the members of the
Buddha's inner circle, but committed a series of misdeeds which actually led

to the creation of a number of the rules for monks. See Professor Edgerton's
Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit Dictionary, as well as the First Dalai Lama and Jampay
Yang of Chim. This same concept of Udayi possessing spiritual fortunes that
we lack is found as well in Pabongka Rinpoche's Gift.
44
Fewer still: The Foundation Word on Vowed Morality is one of the four famed
explanatory sutras on the subject of vowed morality. An exquisite passage
found there begins as follows:
And then Lord Buddha touched the very tip of his precious
fingernail to the ground, and raised it up, and showed it to the
assembled monks. He said,
Monks! Which do you think are more: the atoms of
dust here on the tip of my fingernail, or the atoms
of dust contained in the entire planet of earth?
And the monks replied,
Oh Reverend One, Oh Conqueror, the atoms of
dust there on the tip of Your precious fingernail are
less, they are certainly less, they are most certainly
less, they are infinitely less. If one compared them
to the number of atoms of dust in this great orb
they would not amount to a hundredth, nor even a
thousandth, nor a hundred thousandth, nor any
fraction at all, nor any part--no countable part, no
comparison, no basis for a comparison.
The Conqueror spoke again:
Monks! Think of the number of atoms of dust in
the entire planet: this stands for the number of
beings who are in hell now and who, after they die,
will migrate back to hell. Now think of the number
of atoms of dust on my fingernail: this stands for
the number of beings who are in hell now and
who, after they die, will migrate to the world of
humans.
The Buddha continues his description in a similar vein for all the other types
of rebirths--including humans who are reborn as hell beings (as many as
atoms of dust in the planet), as opposed to humans who are reborn as humans
(as many as the atoms of dust on his fingernail).
This presentation appears throughout the various books on the Steps to

Buddhahood: see those of Je Tsongkapa, Pabongka Rinpoche, and the First
Panchen Lama.
45
A turtle in the sea: These well known lines are found in a letter from the
realized being Nagarjuna (c. 200 AD) to his friend, King Udayibhadra.
46
Keeper of the Diamond himself: That is, tantric Buddhahood: enlightenment in
one lifetime.
47
Like a pack of dogs circling: The Tibetan original at this point actually refers to
"dogs who circle the talisman." In certain cases of illness brought on by
harmful spirits, a Lama will by tradition come to the house of the patient and
prepare a small likeness or talisman representing the person. A ritual is held
centered around the talisman to help remove the evil influence. The figurine
is fashioned from a soft dough and, at the end of the ceremony, is carried
outside and placed on the ground--where hungry Tibetan mastiffs are usually
waiting to gulp it down. The image here then is of a pack of dogs crowded
eagerly around the ritual attendant as he carries out the prize.
48
The three principles of death: This presentation of death appears in many of the
texts on the Steps to Buddhahood, and is summarized as follows in a note
from the English translation of Je Tsongkapa's Principal Teachings of Buddhism
(the text of his Three Principal Paths).
In his masterwork A Gift of Liberation, Pabongka Rinpoche lists six benefits of
keeping your mind on death: your practice becomes really pure; it gains
power; the thoughts help you start practice; they help you strive hard during
your practice; they help bring your practice to a successful conclusion; and in
the hour of death you go with satisfaction, for you know you have spent your
life meaningfully.
The Rinpoche also lists six problems that come from not keeping your mind
on death: you neglect your religious life, and spend all your days in thoughts
of what to eat or wear--this life's distractions; you consider death occasionally
but always think it will come later, and delay your practice; or you do practice,
but for the wrong reason--with hopes of reputation; you practice but with no
enthusiasm, and drop it after a while; you get deeper into this life, your
attitude gets worse, and life begins to hurt you; and at death you naturally feel
intense regret, for you have wasted all your efforts on this present life.
The three principles, for how actually to keep your mind on death, have three
reasons each, making a total of nine. First of all, death is certain: no power in
the universe can stop death when it arrives; there is no way to add time to
your life, you come closer to death every minute; and even while you are alive,
the free time available for your practice is extremely limited before you have
to die.

The second principle is that there is absolutely no certainty when you will die.
We are in a time and realm where the length of life is uncertain; we can be
sure we will never have enough time to defeat all our enemies, raise up all our
friends, and still complete our religious practice before we die. The things that
can kill us are many; the things that keep us alive are few. And in general the
body we have is fragile, weak: a small splinter in the hand can give us an
infection that kills us--we are like bubbles, like candles in a windstorm.
The third principle is that, at the moment of death, nothing at all can help us
but our spiritual practice. None of your money or things can help you. None
of your friends or family can help you--they can be holding you tightly by the
arms and legs, but still you will slip away alone. And not even your own
body can help you--you have to give up your most cherished possession, your
beloved body, along with everything else.
The three principles call for three resolves on our part. Knowing that we shall
have to die, we must resolve to begin our practice. Knowing that we could die
any time, we must quit our worldly work immediately and start our practice
today. And finally, since nothing else can help us, we must devote ourselves
to our practice only. A man who is hiking many miles doesn't fill up his pack
with a lot of junk that he won't be needing.
The above points are paraphrased from the works on the Steps of the path by
Lord Tsongkapa and Pabongka Rinpoche. For the last point mentioned in the
text, the meditation on what it's like to die, we quote the Rinpoche directly:
They try all different kinds of treatments and holy rituals but
your condition gets worse and worse. The doctors start lying to
you. Your friends and relatives say all sorts of cheery things to
your face, but behind your back they start wrapping up your
affairs, because everyone can see you're going to die.
Your body starts to lose its familiar warmth. It's hard to breathe.
The nostrils collapse. The lips curl back. The color starts to
drain from your face. All sorts of repulsive signs begin to show,
inside and outside of you.
You think of all the wrong things you did in your life, and wish
so badly you had never done them. You can't quite be sure if
you ever really got rid of them all when you confessed; or that
you really did any true good deed.
Then comes the final pain, the unspeakable searing pain that
comes with death. The basic building blocks of your body begin
their domino collapse, you are blinded by catastrophic images,
hallucinations of pure terror crowd into your mind, and carry

you away, and the whole world you have been living blinks out.
People take your corpse and wrap it up in a sheet and lay it in
some corner. They hang up a curtain to hide it. Somebody
lights up a smudgy little candle and leaves it there. If you're one
of those reincarnated lamas, they dress you up in you fancy
ritual robes and try to make you look good.
Right now we are all running around trying to arrange ourselves
a nice house, soft clothes, cozy chairs. But you know the custom
here in Tibet--when you die they'll tie your arms and legs up
against your chest with a leather strap, carry the body far from
town, and throw it naked out on the rocks.
Right now we all go home and try to cook ourselves up some
delectable dish--but there will come a day when you stand there
praying for a little taste of those cakes they offer the spirits of the
dead. Right now we have the big name--they call us Doctor
Professor, or Respected Sir, or Your Reverence. But there will
come a day when they look at your body and call you nothing
but "that stinking corpse." There will come a day when the title
they put in front of your name is "the late," or "that guy they
used to call..."
So now when you respected lamas out there in the audience look
at your ritual robes, let it come into your thoughts that these are
the robes they will dress your remains in after you have expired.
And all the rest of us, when we look at our bedsheets before we
go to sleep, should try to remember that these are what they will
wrap our stinking corpse in when we die. As Milarepa said,
That frightful corpse they talk about
Is the very body you wear, meditator.
He means look at your own body now, and always see the future
corpse.

Nothing but the Dharma: Original source of quotation not found. The advice
is to himself, for Master Buton's full name was Rinchen Drup (1290-1364). He
was a consummate scholar of both the secret and open teachings, and Je
Tsongkapa was much influenced by his writings and by his direct disciples.
Buton Rinpoche also played a major role in the organization of the Buddhist
canon in its Tibetan translation.
50
Avoid then any bad deed: Pa Dampa Sangye (d. 1117?) was an Indian Buddhist
master who helped bring the teachings to Tibet, and in particular began the

lineage of a practice called the "Termination of Suffering." The lines here are
found in a collection of advices to the Tibetans of an area called Dingri.
51
Turn your thoughts to the Dharma: This passage is from the same work as the
preceding.
52
Eighty of their different lives: Original source of quotation not found. Bodong
Rinpoche, full name Bodong Panchen Chokle Namgyal (1375-1450), was one
of the most prolific writers in the history of Buddhism--his collected works
subsume no less than 137 volumes.
53
Never just fades away: These lines are some of the most famous in all of
Buddhist literature. They were spoken by Lord Buddha himself and occur
throughout the sutras on vowed morality as a sort of refrain--for example in
the Divisions of Vowed Morality, and the Foundation Word. Their contents are
alluded to also in the famed Sutra of Cosmic Play.
The importance of the concept that the power of an act cannot just fade away
after we commit it is indicated by the fact that many of the earlier Indian
masters include the lines in their philosophical commentaries. Master
Nagarjuna (200 AD), for example, alludes to them in his Root Text on Wisdom,
and Beyond All Fear. Master Bhavya (490-570 AD) speaks of them in his
famous Blaze of Reasoning, as does Master Avalokitavrata in his Extensive
Commentary to the Lamp of Wisdom. The renowned Chandrakirti (650 AD) refers
to the quotation in his Clarification of the Words, his Commentary to the 400
Verses, and his Commentary to the Seventy Verses on Emptiness. It appears as
well in Master Parahita's explanation of the same work.
In Tibet as well the verse and the idea behind it have been considered
indispensable, and it is referred to in a great number of works on the Steps of
the Path. See for example the treatises of Geshe Drolungpa, Je Tsongkapa, the
First Panchen Lama, and Pabongka Rinpoche himself.
54
If nothing else keep your trust: Original source of quotation not found; it is in
a very old local dialect, but the meaning seems correct. For information about
the author, see note 52.
55
Only the All-Knowing know it: The lines are found in the fourth chapter of The
Bodhisattva's Life, a famed manual for aspiring saints dating from the 8th
century.
56
The ones who can protect you: The three lower realms described here
are--respectively--the worlds of hellbeings, craving spirits, and animals. The
Three Jewels that can protect us from them are the Buddha, Dharma, and
Sangha. The Buddha Jewel is defined as "That ultimate source of protection:
the One who has reached the final end of his own goals, and the ability to

achieve others' as well." The Dharma Jewel is "The pure side of existence,
either in the form of the end of all suffering, or the path to that end." The
Sangha Jewel, finally, consists of "All those who are realized"--that is, the
Community of all people who have realized emptiness directly. For these and
an illuminating discussion on the act of taking refuge, see Kedrup Tenpa
Dargye, Analysis of the Perfection of Wisdom.
57
We have little time to live: The lines by Lord Atisha's renowned disciple are
found in a short exquisite work entitled Second Epistle to Shangtrang Kaberchung,
itself a part of the famed Collected Treasure of Beloved Jewels from the teachings
of the Kadampa Lamas. The quotation here appears to consist of two parts
from different places in the text, but the intent is certainly the same.
58
You will feel only pain: Quotation from the same source as the last.
59
The broadest simplification: The list of ten bad deeds (their avoidance being the
ten good deeds) are a very gross abbreviation of the multitude of harmful
actions which we are capable of performing. They include three which we
perform with our bodies: killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct. The next
four are verbal: lying, divisive talk, harsh words, and idle speech. The final
three are mental: coveting, ill will towards others, and wrong views. The
classic presentation of the ten is found in the "Chapter on Deeds" from the
Treasure House of Knowledge, composed by the 4th-century Indian sage
Vasubandhu.

With this we have reached the second part in the advices on how to take the
essence of this life; that is, how to train one's mind in the Steps of the path
which are shared with persons of medium spiritual capacity. Here there are
two divisions. The first is learning how to want freedom, and is presented in
the single verse of the root text which follows:

Bless me to perceive
All that's wrong
With the seemingly good things
Of this life.

I can never get enough of them.
They cannot be trusted.
They are the door
To every pain I have.
Grant me then
To strive instead
For the happiness of freedom.

Suppose we are able to follow all the instructions above: we contemplate how
death works, and think on the sufferings of the lower realms. Then we make
all the effort we are supposed to in going for refuge, and in observing the laws
of deeds and their consequences. Admittedly then we could manage, once or
twice, to reach one of the better forms of life--as a pleasure being or
human--and also acquire some incredible amount of wealth; at least for the
time being.

But the nature of all pleasant things in the circle of life is that, no matter how
much we get, and no matter how much we enjoy what we get, we never feel
as though we've had enough. It only makes us want more, it only increases
our desire. And this then delivers to us a whole variety of unbearable pain.
The pleasant things turn around, and become the door to every pain I have.

That highest of Victors, the Great Fifth of the Dalai Lamas, has said as well,
What happened before?
Someone has been in my mind for time with no beginning.
When was that?
There's never been a moment when they were gone.
Who are they?
I live, and live again, the mental afflictions.
And in the end?
They will leave me to rot in the ocean of suffering
life, without an end in sight.
And the karma?
It comes like the wind, with all the things I never
wanted.

How far?
It whips around me everywhere, and stirs great waves,
the three forms of suffering.
How long?
I could wander around this sea forever; the torch would
spin, and the circle of light would blaze.
What should I see?
Think on this, and see that the afflictions of the mind
are the one true enemy.
What must be done?
The enemy of living for this life must die.
Who shall do it?
You will have to pretend that you are warrior enough to
be the one.
When will it come?
Your foes, the afflictions in your mind, have always
been there waiting, ready for the battle.
Now then?
The time has surely come: go forth now and defeat them.60

As the lines point out, there is one thing which acts as the very root of all our
sufferings here in the circle of life. This is none other than the enemy of the
mental afflictions, so dearly cherished by us, so close to our hearts.

From time with no beginning up to the present moment, this enemy has led
us by the hand to all kinds of unbearable pain. And if still we find ourselves
unable to discard these bad thoughts once and for all, they will force us to
collect karma. Then the karma will force us to take yet another birth in this
house, in the circle of suffering life. And there once again the afflictions will
start, and then we'll collect the karma anew. And so it is decided: this karma
again will force us into the impure parts of a suffering being, in one of the six
forms of life. We'll be born, and then again, and over again and again,
wandering through these six.61

Once we have taken a birth in the cycle, we'll find ourselves tormented by the
three different kinds of suffering, without the slightest break.62
It doesn't
matter at all whether we take a higher birth or a lower one; there exists no
such thing as a pleasant moment here. Whatever place we go is a place that
brings us pain. Whatever friend we go with is a friend who brings us pain.
Whatever possession we have is a possession which brings us pain. They
cannot and will not ever be anything else.

"What way then," you may ask, "must I follow to escape this pain?" You must
find a way to stop the stream of births, the circle of life that has karma and the
mental afflictions as its very nature. Until you manage to do so, you will
never find a place that is free of this suffering.

The key to stopping the stream of suffering births is found in the root text of
the Three Principal Paths, where the Lord of Lamas says,
Think over and over how deeds and their fruits
never fail,
And the cycle's suffering: stop desire
for the future.

Suppose at first we are able to find the very highest of the supposed good
things of this life: we attain the celestial form or fantastic wealth of a god-like
being such as Pure One, or Hundred Gift, or one of those emperors who rules
the world with a disk of power. None of these forms can be trusted though,
for the inevitable end of each is that we meet the karmic fruits of bad deeds we
collected before. These deeds throw us into births like those of the lower
realms, where we are forced to go through the unlimited variety of pain here
in the cycle of suffering life.

We must understand this process, and think over and over about all the

mental afflictions. We must stop desire for any future lives.

As the verse says, we must stop desire for this life first. To do so, think how hard
it is to find this leisure and fortune. And think too on the following: while you
may have managed just this once to find a perfect body and life, still you must
die. You cannot stay here long--there is no way to tack on any extra years to
your life, and the years you do have leak away constantly, never pausing.

Whatever you and I hope to accomplish--whether it be keeping ourselves out
of the three lower realms, or attaining freedom and the state of
All-Knowing--we must learn to stop this habit of hoping for the "good" things
of this life. This is absolutely essential all through our Dharma career: from
the very beginning, on through the middle, and up to the final end.

What's the use of money,

And maintaining our reputation.

Who can take one step
Along with us that day.
What's the use of family, friends,
Who are never there

With toil and sweat
We built a great
And wonderful house for ourselves;
To do it we obliterated

these words, then go and seek some way of finding freedom from the cycle,
and a way to smash your enemy: the afflictions of the mind.

You and I might have some delusions about getting it all together in this
world; a good body, lots of things, power, fame. Regardless of how far we
progress in these things though, let's be honest. If we judge ourselves
properly, we can see that we aren't really much more advanced in our intellect
or strength than common animals, than bugs or birds or whatever.

These things are hardly something worth getting attached to, nothing you
would want to hang on to until your dying breath, nothing you could trust at
all. Much less; for you can even attain the ultimate pleasures and possessions
of all cyclic life--you could become the mighty being called Pure One, or
Hundred Gifts, or else enjoy all the many riches in the kingdom of a world
emperor. In the end though it always turns out the way that the Letter to a
Friend and other such works describe it: wandering aimlessly around in a
house of horrors, the three lower realms of life.

It really doesn't matter what kind of so-called "good" thing you can get here
in the world of suffering, eventually all it can do is deceive you. You must by
yourself expose the lie; you must learn to think clearly about all the problems
these things always bring to you. In time you will see, you will know, that
every inch of this suffering cycle is in its essence pain.

By then you will have renunciation, the kind that wants to reach the joy of the
nirvana beyond both extremes,68
freedom in the short run from the sufferings
of the three lower births, and ultimately from each and every pain in the cycle
of life. And it will be the extraordinary form of renunciation, not the rough
kind that you get just from following whatever someone else tells you, not the
one that stays in the mouth and not the heart, in words and not in truth.

THAR PA'I BDE BA LA DON GNYER CHEN PO BCOS MA MA YIN PA'I BLO SHUGS DRAG TU SKYE BAR GSOL 'DEBS BYED PA YIN GSUNGS,
What we are requesting then here, said our Lama, is that our Lama grant us
the strength to develop a very fierce desire, a strong and genuine wish to reach
the happiness of freedom.

VI. Finding the Right Path to Freedom

GNYIS PA THAR PAR BGROD PA'I LAM GYI RANG BZHIN GTAN LA DBAB PA NI,
This brings us to the second division of how to train one's mind in the Steps
of the path which are shared with persons of medium spiritual capacity; that
is, defining just what kind of path can take us to this freedom. This point is
covered in a single verse from the root text:

,RNAM DAG BSAM PA DE YIS DRANGS PA YI,

(6)
Grant that these pure thoughts
May lead me to be watchful
And to recall
What I should be doing,
Grant me to give
The greatest care
To make the vows of morality
The essence of my practice;
They are
The root of the Buddha's teaching.

Up to now we have explained how to truly see that even the supposed good
things of the circle of life have no essence at all. When that happens, we begin
to feel a total disgust for every corner of the cycle of life. These fierce feelings
of renunciation, these pure thoughts where we wish to reach the happiness of
freedom, will lead us on to something else, as described by the Omniscient One
himself:

,RGYAL BA'I GSUNG RAB MA LUS SDE SNOD GSUM,
,DE PHYIR BSTAN PA'I SNYING PO BSLAB PA GSUM,
,DE DAG THOG MA TSUL KHRIMS BSLAB PA STE,
,DE YI GNAS NI 'DUL BA YIN PAR GSUNGS,
The entire extent
Of the highest of spoken words,
The teaching of the Buddhas,
Is contained in the three collections.
This then is why
The three different trainings
Are the essence of the teachings.
These three start
With the training
Of morality,
And it's spoken that
It resides
In the collection on discipline.

This explains why
So much of the holy Dharma,
Spoken so very well,

Was set down in the form
Of the works On discipline.
Could it ever happen then
That those wise men
Who understand
The proper order
Of the teachings
Would not take joy in these?

Nowhere does it say
Anything else but this:
If you hope to develop
Insight, the training
Of wisdom well,
You must find quietude,
That of concentration.
It says as well
That if you wish to develop
Pure single-pointed mind,
You must have the training
Of morality;
And this is fine advice.

Some brave souls
Claim they'll keep
A lot of different vows,
But it's oh so common
To see them smash
Whatever pledges they've made.
The way of the holy
Is to strive
To maintain their morality pure,
Exactly as
They have agreed
To do so.

Once you see
The truth in this,
Then use your watchfulness,
Constantly check
Your thoughts, words and deeds
To stop any wrong to come.

Recollect yourself,
Take the greatest care,
Have a sense of shame,
And consideration;
Use them on
The horse of the senses
When he mistakes the way.
Use your strength
To rein him in,
For this is the state of mind
That you can bring
To focus and stay
On any virtuous object
Solidly,
Whatever you want,
However you wish it to be;
And this is why
They sing the praises
Of morality as the way
To reach one-pointedness of mind.69

The process that Je Tsongkapa is describing goes like this. Recollection comes
at the beginning, and keeps you from forgetting what you should be doing, and
what you shouldn't be doing. Watchfulness then stops by from time to time to
check whether or not the activities of your body, speech, and mind are tending
towards right or wrong. One's ability to take great care in his life functions
throughout; it prevents every sort of improper thought or action, and keeps
one within the bounds of what is appropriate to undertake.

The essential points of the entire teaching of the victorious Buddha, the meaning
of the contents of the three collections of the Word, all this is included within
three precious, extraordinary forms of training: the trainings of morality, of
meditative concentration, and wisdom. The crux on which the latter two
trainings turn, their basis, their root and the ground they stand upon, is in the
main a single item: morality, in the form of the various vows of freedom.70
As
the great Panchen Lama, Lobsang Chukyi Gyaltsen has said,

,SNGON CHAD BCAS RKYANG PHRO MO DU MA LA,
,'DI TZAM 'DAS KYANG NYES PA CHUNG SNYAM DU,
,BSAM ZHING DE DANG 'GAL BA DU MA BYAS,
,LEGS PAR BRTAGS NA DE LTAR SEMS PA DE,
,BDE 'GRO'I SROG RTZA GCOD PA'I GSHED MAR 
It all begins
When you think to yourself
"It won't hurt much
If I break a few
Of these minor vows
In a minor way";
Before too long
You have gone against
A great many of your vows.
If you really think about it,
This kind of attitude
Is like a butcher

Who comes to
Rip out the life
Of your future higher birth.71

'DUG,CES GSUNGS PA LTAR BCAS RGYANG PHRA MO ZHIG GIS KYANG DE LTAR 'GYUR NA, DE LAS CHE BA'I NYES PA BSAGS PAS NI SDUG BSNGAL BZOD GLAGS MED PA'I NGAN 'GRO KHO NAR BRGYUD DE 'GRO BA LAS 'OS MED PHYIR   
The point here is that, if something so small as breaking a single minor vow
can escalate so far, then needless to say when we amass a collection of even
greater transgressions it's only proper that it would eventually lead us
precisely to one of the three lower realms--to a kind of pain which is totally
beyond our ability to withstand it.

For this reason we must be sure never to think lightly of any transgression we
might commit, even down to the minor vows; we must absolutely keep all our
vows just so. And so you must become masters in understanding all the
various vows and advices related to whichever one of the eight sets of the
vows of freedom you have assented to follow. And once you have learned
them perfectly, well then you must make them the essence of your practice.

This is what you are requesting, said our Lama, from your Lama in this verse.
You are asking that he or she help you gain the strength to keep your vows
perfectly; that you learn to think of the vows contained within your being as
the true representative of the Buddha himself, inside you; that you love and
cherish your vows, and always hope to defend them. You are asking, he said,
to be granted the ability to follow the way of this and the other extraordinary
trainings, exactly as they were meant to be.

OPEN STEPS FOR THOSE OF GREATER CAPACITY
VII. Developing the Wish for Enlightenment

GSUM PA SKYE BU CHEN PO'I LAM GYI RIM PAR BLO SBYANG BA LA GNYIS LAS, DANG PO BYANG CHUB TU SEMS BSKYED PA'I TSUL NI,
This brings us to the third and final part of the advices on how to take the
essence of this life: how lastly to train one's mind in the Steps of the path for
persons of greater spiritual capacity. Here too there are two divisions. The
first is how to develop the Wish for enlightenment, and is presented in the
single verse of the root text which follows.

,RANG NYID SRID MTSOR LHUNG BA JI BZHIN DU,

(7)
I have slipped and fallen
Into the sea
Of this suffering life;
Bless me to see
That every living being,
Every one my own mother,
Has fallen in too.
Grant me then
To practice this highest
Wish for enlightenment,
To take on myself
The task of freeing them all.

,DE NI DE BAS LHAG PAR 'GYUR,
Now the Sutra that Viradatta Requested says,
Were the merit of the Wish for enlightenment
To take on some kind of physical form
It would fill the reaches of space itself
And then spill over farther still.72

,ZHES SOGS DANG ,
The book called The Bodhisattva's Life too has lines like the following:
All the other
Kinds of virtue
Are like a bamboo tree;
They give their fruits
And then they always
Die and go away.
But the Wish
For Buddhahood
Is an evergreen that always

Gives forth its fruits,
And instead of fading
Flourishes even more.73

JO BO CHEN POS,
,THABS GOMS DBANG GIS BDAG NYID KYIS,
,GANG GIS SHES RAB RNAMS BSGOMS PA,
,DES NI BYANG CHUB MYUR DU 'THOB,
,BDAG MED GCIG PU BSGOMS PAS MIN,
The Great Lord has also spoken:
Those great beings
Who meditate
On the method,
And so upon
The various kinds
Of wisdom,
Achieve then
Enlightenment
With speed.
It cannot be done
By meditating
On no-self-nature alone.74

,ZHES PA DANG , RJE BLA MA RANG NYID KYIS KYANG ,
,SEMS BSKYED THEG MCHOG LAM GYI GZHUNG SHING STE,
Our Lord Lama himself says finally,
The Wish for enlightenment
Is the central beam
That holds up every path
Of the way which is supreme.75

,ZHES SOGS PHAN YON MTHA' KLAS PA GSUNGS PA LTAR RANG RES SANGS RGYAS KYI GO 'PHANG ZHIG 'DOD PHYIN CHAD BYANG CHUB KYI SEMS BSKYED PA 'DI MED THABS MED,
We can see from these and other works that the fine qualities of the Wish for
enlightenment are limitless. From the first moment that you and I decide we
are going to try to reach the state of a Buddha, this Wish for enlightenment is
something we can never do without.

'DI YOD NA YON TAN GZHAN GANG YANG MED KYANG RGYAL BA'I SRAS ZHES BYA BA'I MING THOB CING , THEG CHEN PA'I GRAL DU TSUD,
The minute we reach this state of mind, even if we have no other admirable
qualities at all, we win the title of "Son (or Daughter) of the Buddha." We also
then enter the ranks of people who live the greater way.

SEMS 'DI MED PAR BDAG MED PA'I LTA BA BSGOM PA SOGS YON TAN GZHAN JI 'DRA YOD KYANG 'TSANG RGYA RGYU LTA CI, THEG PA CHEN PO'I GRAL DU'ANG MI CHUD PAS NA, BYANG CHUB TU SEMS BSKYED PA GAL CHE,
If though we lack this great Wish, then it doesn't matter how many great
virtues we might possess--abilities like being able to meditate on the ultimate
view, where we see that things have no nature of their own. We still won't be
able to join the ranks of those on the greater way, much less reach
enlightenment. And so the Wish is vital.

DE LA SKYES BU CHUNG 'BRING SKABS NGAN SONG DANG 'KHOR BA'I SDUG BSNGAL RANG STENG DU BSGOMS PAS NGES 'BYUNG SKYES YOD TSE,
In the sections where we trained ourselves in the steps that are shared with
practitioners of lesser and medium capacity, we meditated on the sufferings of
the lower realms, and of the entire circle of life, but relative only to ourselves.
In this way we developed the virtue of a healthy disgust for the kind of life we
live.

'DIR GZHAN STENG DU KHA SPOS TE BSAMS NA SNYING RJE SOGS SKYE BA 'ONG BAS, BYANG CHUB 
LAM RIM LAS GSUNGS PA LTAR GYI MAN NGAG RGYU 'BRAS BDUN MA DANG , BDAG GZHAN MNYAM BRJE'I SGO NAS BLO RIM GYIS SBYANGS TE,
Here you take the same thoughts and transfer them--you try to feel them
relative to the condition that others are in. Then compassion and the other
attitudes will start to grow within you; train your mind thus in the proper
progression, using either the "seven-part, cause-and-effect instruction," or else
the practice called "exchanging self and others," following these methods as the
books on the Steps of the path to Buddhahood describe them.76

SEMS BSKYED KYI MYONG BA SNE ZIN TZAM SKYES PA SOGS NAS SMON 'JUG GI SEMS CHO GAS BZUNG BA SOGS LA SLOB PA DGOS,
You must train yourself in all the relevant details; an example would be
committing yourself through formal rituals to the Wish as a prayer and to the
Wish as actual action, once you had reached a point such as finding your first
strong feelings of familiarity with the Wish.

The meaning of the root text here then is as follows. I myself have slipped and
fallen into the sea of the pain of this suffering life; that is, I have dropped into the
ocean of the circle of births. I cannot even guess how deep it is, nor how far
its edges lie. The great sea-waves of my deeds and the afflictions of my mind,
of birth and getting old and death, rage around me.

A great host of ruthless creatures living in the water rise up and attack me
constantly; these are the three sufferings--the suffering of outright pain, the
suffering of pleasure that changes, and the suffering of simply being alive.
They rip at me, they torture me, relentlessly, unceasingly.

TSE RABS THOG MA MED PA'I DUS NAS DRIN CHEN PO'I SGO NAS YANG DANG YANG DU BSKYANGS PA'I MAR GYUR PA'I 'GRO BA KUN TE   
And the same thing is happening to every other living being. Every one of them
has in the past been my own mother; in the beginningless string of lives I have
lived through, they cared for me and sheltered me, with incredible kindness.

I must learn to see how all these fellow beings have fallen in too, how they have
been thrown down into misery by this mass of suffering. And then I must
resolve to take upon myself the task of freeing them all from every pain, and from
every cause of pain. I must assure they reach every form of happiness. I will
do it myself, alone, without waiting or depending on anyone else. Beyond
everything, I myself will see to it that every one of them climbs to the state of
a Buddha.

In short, said our Lama, we are asking our Lama for the ability to find fierce
feelings of love and compassion, states of mind where we can bear not a
moment longer to watch our fellow, mother beings live so bereft of happiness,
and so plagued by suffering. We are asking that these feelings inspire in us
the highest aspiration, the true and uncontrived Wish for enlightenment. And we
are asking our Lama for the ability to meditate upon this Wish, and practice it,
and make it totally perfect, right here, on this very seat, before we stand up
again.

With this we have reached the second division to the instruction on how to
train one's mind in the Steps of the path for persons of greater spiritual
capacity. This division covers training yourself in the activities of a bodhisattva,
once you have managed to achieve the Wish for enlightenment just described.
Our discussion proceeds in two parts: training in the open half of the
bodhisattva activities, and training in the secret half of the bodhisattva
activities. The former has two steps as well; the first of these explains how to
train oneself in the activities as a whole, and is presented in a single verse of
the root text.

(8)
Bless me to see clearly
That the Wish itself
Is not enough,
For if I'm not well trained
In the three moralities,
I cannot become a Buddha.
Grant me then
A fierce resolve
To master the vows
For the children of the Victors.

Suppose you are able, as described above, to reach the Wish for enlightenment,
where you truly hope to achieve the state of a Buddha in order to help every
living being. This itself is not enough. Once you do reach the Wish, you must
still take on the vows of these bodhisattva princes and princesses, these sons
and daughters of the victorious Buddhas. And then you must train yourself
in giving and the other five perfections. Otherwise there is no way you could
ever come to enlightenment.

DES NA 'DIR PHAR PHYIN DRUG TSUL KHRIMS RNAM PA GSUM DU BSDUS TE GSUNGS PA HA CANG GNAD CHE STE,
This fact explains why it is so very important when holy beings have said that
all six perfections77
are covered in the three types of morality.

SPYIR SER SKYA GANG YIN YANG NGES PAR BSRUNG DGOS PA'I BSRUNG BYA THUN MONG BA MI DGE BCU SPONG GI TSUL KHRIMS LEGS PAR BSRUNG BA'I 
The first type is called the "morality of keeping oneself from committing
wrong." Here you begin by being extremely careful to keep the morality of
avoiding the ten bad deeds.78
This type of good behavior is common to
everyone, whether they wear the robes or not, and must absolutely be
maintained.

THOGBYE BRAG TU RANG RANG GIS SO THAR, BYANG SEMS, GSANG SNGAGS TE SDOM PA GSUM GANG KHAS BLANGS PA DE DANG DE'I BCAS MTSAMS DANG 'GAL BA'I NYES PAS NAM YANG MA GOS PA'I THABS LA NAN TAN CHEN PO'I SGO NAS 'BAD PAR BYED PA NYES SPYOD SDOM PA'I TSUL KHRIMS,
More specifically, with this first type of morality, you must in addition exert
yourself to the fullest, so to assure that your life is never sullied in the least by
overstepping the bounds of any of the vows you have agreed to keep. Here
we refer to vows that belong to any of the three traditional sets: the freedom
vows, the bodhisattva vows, and the secret vows.79

BSOD NAMS DANG YE SHES TE TSOGS GNYIS KYIS BSDUS PA'I DGE RTZA RLABS PO CHE RNAMS THABS SNA TSOGS KYI SGO NAS RANG RGYUD LA SDUD PAR BYED PA DGE BA'I CHOS SDUD PA'I TSUL KHRIMS,
The second type of morality is known as the "morality of collecting goodness."
This is where you use a great variety of means to gather or collect extremely
potent stores of virtue into your being; these are the virtues of amassing merit
and wisdom.80

SNGAR BSHAD PA'I SDOM PA'I TSUL KHRIMS DE RNAMS RANG DON YID BYED KYIS MA BSLAD PAR SEMS CAN THAMS CAD KYI PHYIR RDZOGS BYANG DON DU GNYER BA KHO NA'I CHED DU BSRUNG BA SEMS CAN DON BYED KYI TSUL KHRIMS YIN PAS,
The third type of morality is the "morality that acts for every sentient being."
Here you take care to keep the different varieties of morality mentioned above
that involve restraining yourself from wrong; but instead of doing so with a
motivation which is infected with any self-interest, you act only out of an
intention to reach total Buddhahood for the sake of all living kind.

You must find a sure kind of knowledge where you see clearly how--if you
lack a total fluency in these three types of morality, if you are not well trained and
completely accustomed to following them--then you cannot become one of those
who has reached the fully enlightened state of a Buddha.

Once you have found this knowledge, you must take on the vows for the
"children of the Victors" (that is, the bodhisattva vows), and then with a resolve
of fierce intensity you must learn and master the three types of morality. What
we are requesting of our Lama here, said our Lama, is that he or she grant us
the ability to do so.
IX. Training in the Final Two Perfections

GNYIS PA PHAR PHYIN THA MA GNYIS LA SLOB TSUL NI,
Having presented the bodhisattva activities in general, we will now turn to the
more particular description of how to train oneself in the final two perfections.
This point is covered in the single verse of the root text which follows.

,LOG PA'I YUL LA G-YENG BA ZHI BYED CING ,
,YANG DAG DON LA TSUL BZHIN DPYOD PA YI,
,ZHI GNAS LHAG MTHONG ZUNG DU 'BREL BA'I LAM,
,MYUR DU RGYUD LA SKYE BAR BYIN GYIS RLOBS,
,ZHES PA'I {SHl}OO KA GCIG GIS BSTAN,
(9)
Grant that I may quickly gain
The path where quietude
And insight join together;
One which quiets
My mind from being
Distracted to wrong objects,
The other which analyzes
The perfect meaning
In the correct way.

DE YANG LOG PA'I YUL ZHES PA PHYIN CI LOG GI YUL LA BYA DGOS PA DPER NA, PHYI ROL PAS RDEL SHING SOGS LA SEMS BZUNGS NAS TING NGE 'DZIN BSGOM PA LTA BU STE, DE 'DRA'I SEMS PHYI ROL GYI LOG PA'I YUL LA RNAM PAR G-YENG BA ZHI BA'AM MED PAR BYED CING ,
The verse here speaks of objects which are "wrong"; this should be understood
as referring to objects which are mistaken, in a particular sense. One example
would be trying to develop meditative concentration by fixing the mind on a
short stick of wood, as some non-Buddhists advocate. We must seek to "quiet"
the mind--that is, stop the mind--from being distracted to these types of wrong,
external objects.

BOD KHA CIG LTAR YID BYED THAMS CAD BKAG STE NAG THOM ME BAR GNAS PA LA ZHI GNAS DANG , DE THOG NAS, SEMS ZHES PA DE DBYIBS DANG KHA DOG GANG DU GRUB 'DUG BRTAGS NAS MA RNYED PA'I SEMS KYI KUN RDZOB PA'I NGO BO STONG SANG TZAM LA LHAG MTHONG DU BSHAD PA LTA BU MIN PAR,
There are Tibetan schools of the past too which have taught that meditative
quietude consisted of not thinking about anything at all, just keeping the mind
in some dark state of dullness. The high state of perfect insight then they
explain as moving in this stupor to a realization of the pure and simple
emptiness of the deceptive nature of the mind--except they describe this
emptiness as what you come to when you analyze whether or not what we call
the "mind" consists of any shape or color, and then fail to find that it's any
such thing.

RGYAL TSAB BYAMS PA'I DBUS MTHA' RNAM 'BYED KYI MAN NGAG RJE'I LAM RIM CHE CHUNG SOGS LAS GSUNGS PA LTAR   
But none of these ideas is correct; rather, we must follow texts such as the
briefer and more expanded explanations of the Steps to the path composed by
the Lord himself, where he presents the instructions given by the Great Regent,
Loving One, in his own work entitled Separating the Middle and the Extremes.

   NYES PA LNGA SPONG ZHING , GNYEN PO 'DU BYED BRGYAD BSTEN PA DANG , YID BYED BZHI DANG LDAN PA'I SEMS GNAS PA DGU RIM BZHIN BSGRUBS TE,
These treatises describe how one progresses in steps by eliminating the five
problems to meditation, taking the eight corrective actions, and achieving the
nine mental states, complete with their four different modes.81

DGE BA'I DMIGS RNAM GANG RUNG ZHIG LA RTZE GCIG TU BZHAG PAS LUS SEMS SHIN SBYANGS KYI DGA' BA DES DRANGS PA'I ZHI GNAS DANG ,
One thus attains a kind of bliss, a total pliancy of body and mind, which comes
from staying in one-pointed meditation on any virtuous object one chooses.
This then leads to what we call meditative quietude.

YANG DAG STE, BDAG MED PA'I DON LA SO SOR RTOG PA'I SHES RAB KYIS TSUL BZHIN DU DPYOD CING , DPYAD MTHAR RNYED PA'I NGES SHES KYI DON LA MNYAM PAR 'JOG PA'I DPYAD 'JOG ZUNG DU 'BREL BA LA BRTEN NAS BYUNG BA'I LUS SEMS SHIN SBYANGS KYI BDE BAS ZIN PA'I LHAG MTHONG BSGOM PA BCAS   
The phrase "perfect meaning" here in the verse refers to a particular object: the
fact that nothing has any nature of its own.82
A kind of wisdom used for
examining the nature of something analyzes this object in a certain correct way,
and by the end of its analysis comes to a definite conclusion. The mind stays
in meditation upon this truth, such that the analysis and a fixation on this
object join and work together. This brings on a feeling of bliss that fills the
mind completely--and one has thus achieved what we call "perfect insight."

   DE LTA BU'I ZHI GNAS DANG LHAG MTHONG YA MA BRAL BAR NYAMS SU BLANGS PA LA BRTEN NAS ZHI LHAG ZUNG 'BREL GYI RTOGS PA KHYAD PAR CAN MYUR BA NYID DU RGYUD LA SKYE BAR BYIN GYIS RLOBS SHIG CES GSOL BA BTAB PA'O,
We seek to practice this process, where quietude and insight are no longer
separated one from the other. When we recite the verse we are asking our
Lama to grant that, as a result, we may quickly gain within our minds that
exceptional form of realization where meditative quietude and perfect insight
join together.

SECRET STEPS FOR THOSE OF GREATER CAPACITY
X. Entering the Way of the Diamond

GNYIS PA SNGAGS PHYOGS KYI SPYOD PA LA SLOB PA'I TSUL LA GSUM, RGYUD SNOD RUNG DU BYAS NAS DBANG BZHI RNAM PAR DAG PA NOS TE RDO RJE'I THEG PA LA 'JUG PA, DBANG DUS KYI KHAS BLANGS PA'I DAM TSIG DANG SDOM PA DAG PAR BYA TSUL, DAM SDOM LA GNAS NAS LAM RIM PA GNYIS BSGOM PA'I TSUL LO, DANG PO NI,
This brings us to the second part of our discussion about the activities of a
bodhisattva: training oneself in the secret half of these endeavors. Here there
are three different Steps: how to enter into the Way of the Diamond by making
oneself a worthy vessel and then receiving a pure form of the four
empowerments; how to keep pure the pledges and vows that one took on
when he received the empowerments; and how to meditate upon the two
stages of this path, as one continues to maintain his pledges and vows. The
first of these three is presented in the single verse of the root text which
follows.

,THUN MONG LAM SBYANGS SNOD DU GYUR PA NA,
,THEG PA KUN GYI MCHOG GYUR RDO RJE'I 
THEG,SKAL BZANG SKYE BO'I 'JUG NGOGS DAM PA DER,

,ZHES PA'I {SHl}OO KA GCIG GSUNGS TE,
(10)
Grant that once I've practiced well
The paths shared and become
A vessel that is worthy,
I enter with perfect ease
The Way of the Diamond,
Highest of all ways,
Holiest door to come inside
For the fortunate and the good.

You must first have practiced well the general Steps of the path which are
"shared" by both the open and the secret teachings; that is, which are so
important for both that you could never succeed without them. More
specifically, you must have trained your mind well in the three principal paths:
renunciation, the Wish for enlightenment, and the correct view of reality.83
On
top of this you must have as your motivation a very fierce desire to reach
enlightenment for the sake of every living being. These then make you a vessel
that is worthy to enter the Way of the Secret Word.

'BRAS BU LAM DU BYED PA SOGS YOD PA'I CHA NAS NYAN THOS DANG RANG RGYAL DANG BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA'I THEG PA KUN GYI MCHOG TU GYUR PA GSANG SNGAGS RDO RJE'I THEG PA LA 'JUG DGOS SHING ,
When this time has come you must surely enter the "Way of the Diamond";
which is to say, this Way of the Secret Word. It is the highest of all the
"different ways"--the ways of the listeners, the self-made Buddhas, and the
bodhisattvas.84
What makes the Diamond Way higher is that it has certain
unique features, such as using the goal of practice as a path to the goal.

RDO RJE'I SKAD DOD BADZR ZHES PA DBYER MI PHYED PA LA 'JUG PAS NA, RDO RJE NI NGES DON GYI THUGS RDO RJE LTA BU'I TING NGE 'DZIN NAM, THABS BDE BA CHEN PO DANG SHES RAB STONG PA NYID GNYIS DBYER MI PHYED PA'I YE SHES DE NYID YIN LA,
The Tibetan word for "diamond" here is dorje. This is a translation of the
Sanskrit word vajra--a term that has the basic meaning of "inseparable." The
"diamond" here is the actual diamond of the holy mind of the Buddha; that
deep state of meditation which can only be compared to a diamond. You can
also say it refers to that one type of wisdom which is the inseparable
combination of what we call "method" (great bliss) and "wisdom" (emptiness).

THEG PA ZHES PA BZHON PA'I MING STE, RDO RJE'I THEG PA ZHES PA'ANG RDO RJE'I BZHON PA ZHES PA LTA BUR YOD PAS, PHAR PHYIN THEG PAR SANGS RGYAS KYI GO 'PHANG GRANGS MED GSUM GYI YUN LA SGRUB DGOS PHYIR BZHON PA MED PAR RKANG THANG GIS BGROD PA'I TSOD TZAM DU 'GOR BA YIN ZHING ,
The word for "way" here has a meaning of "conveyance"--something you get
on and ride to reach a destination. The "diamond way" mentioned here is thus
a kind of "diamond conveyance" as well. In the way of the perfections, one
must carry on his practice for three "countless" eons in order to reach
Buddhahood.85
This takes so long that it's almost as if you were walking on
foot, rather than travelling on any sort of conveyance.

GSANG SNGAGS RDO RJE'I THEG PA LA BRTEN NA DE LTAR MI DGOS PAR ZUNG 'JUG GI GO 'PHANG SNYIGS DUS KYI TSE THUNG GCIG GAM, LO GSUM PHYOGS GSUM TZAM GYI RING LA 'THOB PAR BYED NUS PAS RTA BZANG PO BANG RTZAL CAN ZHON PA LTAR 'TSANG RGYA BA'I THABS HA CANG ZAB CING MYUR LA,
If though you use the Diamond Way, the Way of the Secret Word, no such
length of time is needed: you can attain the state of secret Buddhahood, Union,
in the length of but one lifetime--even in one of the very short kinds of life
that we have here now, in the age of degeneration. In fact it's possible to reach
Buddhahood in no more than three years and three months. This way then is
a method which is incredibly deep and quick; more like riding a fine racehorse.

The kinds of practitioners that we call "listeners" and "self-made Buddhas"
aspire only to reach a state of blissful peace, and this too only for themselves.
They are deficient therefore in that fortunate kind of good virtue that makes
one want to take on the burden of helping others. Bodhisattvas, on the other
hand, disregard completely their own comfort and work only for the good of
others. They are full of the wonderful fortune and goodness that enables them
to reach the state of a perfect Buddha, and the ability to fulfil, totally, the
ultimate needs of both others and themselves.

What is the "holiest" (meaning highest) door, or gateway, for bodhisattvas; for
these people who are so fortunate and good--to come inside this path? It is
receiving the four empowerments of the Diamond Way, the Way of the Secret
Word, and receiving them perfectly, so that they are sure to plant the seeds for
the four bodies of a Buddha.
What we are requesting in this verse then, said our Lama, is that our Lama
grant us the ability to enter, with perfect ease, the profound path just described:
the Way of the Diamond, the unsurpassed form of the Secret Word.
XI. Keeping Vows and Pledges Pure

GNYIS PA DBANG DUS KYI KHAS BLANGS PA'I DAM TSIG DANG SDOM PA DAG PAR BYA BA'I TSUL NI,
With this we have reached the second Step to training oneself in the secret half
of the bodhisattva activities; that is, how to keep pure the pledges and vows
that one took on when he received his secret empowerment. This Step too is
presented in a single verse of the root text:

,DE TSE DNGOS GRUB RNAM GNYIS 'GRUB PA'I GZHI,
,RNAM DA DAM TSIG SDOM PAR GSUNGS PA LA,
,BCOS MA MIN PA'I NGES PA RNYED GYUR NAS,
,SROG DANG BSDOS TE BSRUNG BAR BYIN GYIS RLOBS,
,ZHES PA'I {SHl}OO KA GCIG GIS BSTAN CING ,
(11)
Bless me to know
With genuine certainty
That when I've entered thus,
The cause that gives me
Both the attainments
Is keeping my pledges
And vows most pure.
Grant me then
To always keep them
Even if it costs my life.

DE YANG GSANG SNGAGS RDO RJE THEG PA'I SNOD RUNG DU GYUR NAS DBANG BZHI LEGS PAR THOB PA DE'I TSE,
Now suppose you have entered thus--you have made yourself a vessel which
is worthy of the Diamond Way, the Way of the Secret Word; and you have
received, in the proper manner, the four different empowerments. If you then
follow the correct method you can gain both the attainments: the one we call the
"ultimate," and the one we describe as "shared."

MCHOG GI DNGOS GRUB MI SLOB PA'I ZUNG 'JUG RGYAL BA RDO RJE 'CHANG GI GO 'PHANG DANG ,
The ultimate attainment is reaching secret Union, where there is nothing more
to be learned. This is the state of the Victorious One, the Keeper of the
Diamond.

RAL GRI, MIG SMAN, RKANG MGYOGS, RI LU, SA 'OG, MI SNANG BA, BCUD LEN,
MKHA' SPYOD KYI DNGOS GRUB BCAS GRUB PA CHEN PO BRGYAD LA SOGS PA'I THUN MONGS GI DNGOS GRUB STE   
The shared attainments are those such as the "eight great attainments." These
include the special powers known as the sword, the eye ointment, swift feet,
the pill, passing underground, disappearing, taking essence, and sky walking.86
   DNGOS GRUB RNAM PA GNYIS GANG LAS SGRUB PA'I GZHI'AM, BRTEN SA LTA BU NI DBANG GI DUS SU GANG KHAS BLANGS PA'I RTZA BA DANG YAN LAG GI DAM TSIG DANG SDOM PA MTHA' DAG RNAM PAR DAG PAR BSRUNG BA NYID YIN PAS,
What then is it that can give you these attainments? Their cause or foundation,
the very support that holds them all up, is one thing, and only one: to keep
most pure every one of the root and secondary pledges and vows which you took
upon yourself when you were granted the empowerments.

BYANG SEMS KYI RTZA LTUNG BCO BRGYAD DANG , NYES BYAS ZHE DRUG, GSANG SNGAGS KYI RTZA LTUNG BCU BZHI DANG , SBOM PO BRGYAD, GZHAN YANG RIGS LNGA SPYI BYE BRAG GI DAM TSIG RNAMS TSUL BZHIN BSRUNG DGOS SHING ,
We must therefore honor and keep, just as we are required, the various vows
and pledges. For the bodhisattva vows, this means never committing any of
the eighteen root downfalls, or the forty-six secondary violations. For the
secret vows, it involves avoiding perfectly the fourteen root downfalls and the
eight serious offenses, while being sure to honor the general and also the
individual pledges of the Five Classes.

DE YANG , MI SHES PA, MA GUS PA, BAG MED PA, NYON MONGS MANG BA STE LTUNG BA 'BYUNG BA'I SGO BZHI PO MA BKAG PAR BSRUNG MI NUS,
You will never be able to protect all your pledges and vows unless you
manage to slam shut the four doors through which the downfalls make their
appearance. These four are ignorance, disrespect, carelessness, and particularly
severe mental afflictions.

DE DGAG PA'I TSUL NI, LTUNG BA 'BYUNG TSUL RNAMS SHES PA, LAS 'BRAS BSAMS NAS BSLAB PA LA GUS PA, RGYUN DU DRAN PA DANG SHES BZHIN LA GNAS PA, NYON MONGS GANG SHAS CHE BA'I GNYEN PO BSTEN PA RNAMS YIN CING ,
To keep these doors closed we must, respectively, learn and know when and
how a downfall occurs. We must contemplate the laws of actions and their
consequences, thereby gaining a deep respect for the various instructions on
how to keep these commitments. We must remain in a constant state of
recollection and watchfulness. Finally, we must employ the antidote that will
work against the particular mental affliction that happens to be our own most
serious problem.

BYANG SEMS DANG SNGAGS KYI BSLAB BYA'I SKOR RNAMS RJE TZONG KHA PA CHEN PO'I GSUNG BYANG SEMS BSLAB BYA BYANG CHUB GZHUNG LAM DANG , GSANG SNGAGS KYI RTZA LTUNG RNAM BSHAD DNGOS GRUB SNYE MA SOGS DANG ,
As for where to find instructions on the vows and pledges, you can use a
number of works by the Lord, Tsongkapa. Some examples would be his
treatise called Highway to Buddhahood for advice on the bodhisattva vows, or
the Golden Harvest of Attainments for a complete explanation of the root
downfalls in the secret vows.

NYUNG MTHAR SDOM GSUM BSLAB BYA NOR BU'I 'OD 'PHRENG DANG , SNGAGS BYANG SEMS KYI BSLAB BYA'I SDOMS TSIG LTA BU BSLAB BYA RGYAS BSDUS CI LCOGS LAS NGES PAR BYAS TE BSRUNG DGOS,
At the very least you should study the book of advices on the three sets of
vows known as the String of Shining Jewels, or one of those summaries in verse
that teach about the secret and bodhisattva vows.87
Use any of these
presentations, brief or long, according to the time you have available to you;
come to a firm understanding of each of the vows and pledges, and then at all
costs keep them.

DE LTAR BSRUNGS TE DAM SDOM LA TSUL BZHIN DU GNAS PA ZHIG BYUNG PHYIN CHAD LAM BSKYED RDZOGS BSGOM PA SOGS LA 'BAD PA CHEN PO MA THUB PAR TSE 'DIR SA LAM MTHAR PHYIN PA MA BYUNG YANG ,
Let's say you are able to keep your vows and pledges as described--you live
your life in proper accordance with them all. Certain results will follow then,
even if you find yourself unable to make great efforts in practices such as
meditation on the stages of creation and completion, and so therefore fail
during this life to reach the final end of the various paths and levels.

The immense power of the purity of your pledges and vows will lead you over
the string of your future lives to attain a very special kind of life, where you
can practice the secret teachings. You will always meet an authentic Diamond
Master--one who teaches you the secret way. And you will always find
yourself able to put the secret paths into actual practice.

   SKYE BA BDUN NAM, DMA' MTHA'ANG SKYE BA BCU DRUG TSUN CHAD DU NGES PAR 'TSANG RGYA BAR STON PA RDO RJE 'CHANG GIS GSANG BA'I MDZOD KYI RGYUD LAS,
As such you will, without a doubt, be able to reach total enlightenment within
seven lifetimes, or in sixteen at the very most. On this our Teacher, the Keeper
of the Diamond, has spoken the following in the Tantra of the Treasure of Secrets:

,DBANG BSKUR YANG DAG SBYIN LDAN NA,
,SKYE DANG SKYE BAR DBANG BSKUR 'GYUR,
,DE YIS SKYE BA BDUN LA NI,
,MA BSGOMS PAR YANG DNGOS GRUB THOB,
If the person is granted
A pure empowerment,
Then life after life
Will the power be given.
Within seven lives
The goal is reached,

Even if the person
Does not meditate.

At least in the next.88

,CES DANG , RNAM GROL ZLA BAS,
,MA BSGOM SGYUR KYANG LTUNG MED NA,
,SKYE BA BCU DRUG DAG NA 'GRUB,
Vibhuti Chandra says as well,
Even should he fail to meditate,
A person will reach the goal
Within the length of sixteen lives,
So long as a downfall has not occurred.89

,CES PA DANG , DAM TSIG LNGA PA LAS KYANG ,
,GAL TE LTUNG BA MED GYUR NA,
,SKYE BA BCU DRUG DAG NA 'GRUB,
The Book of the Five Pledges concurs:
As long as there is no downfall,
The goal is reached in sixteen lives.90

You must come to know these facts with genuine certainty--that is, you must
seek a kind of firm belief in them that is deeply rooted within you, so much
that no one else could ever change your mind. And because of this knowledge
you must then protect your commitments, "even if it costs your life."

   ZHES PA DPER NA, MU STEGS PA DANG KLA KLO LTA BU MI BSRUN PA'I SKYE BO SDIG PO CHE ZHIG GIS, KHYOD SDOM PA DAM THIG 'DI TSO MI BSRUNG RGYU KHAS MA BLANGS NA DA LTA RANG GSOD NGES YIN ZHES ZER TE TSUL KHRIMS BLOS MA BTANG NA GSOD PAR THAG CHOD PA ZHIG TU GYUR KYANG ,
What would it be to cost your life? Imagine for example some follower of a
non-Buddhist religion, or some kind of barbarian, who was really very cruel,
very evil. And suppose he came up to you and said, "If you don't agree not
to keep those pledges and vows of yours, then I swear I will kill you, this very
instant." Suppose it were completely decided: either you reject this morality,
or you die.

NGAS TSUL KHRIMS 'DI YAL BAR BOR NA KHOS MA BSOD KYANG SKYE BA GTAN GYI 'DUN MA SHI TSAR BA YIN PAS GSON KYANG SHI BA DANG KHYAD PAR MED LA, TSUL KHRIMS BSRUNG NA TSE RABS GTAN DU BDE BAR 'GYUR BAS DE BSRUNG BA'I DON DU DA LTA KHOS GSAD KYANG RUNG STE   
At the "cost of your life" then your choice would go like this. If I discard my
morality now he will spare me; but the ultimate hope of my infinite lifetimes
will be murdered instead. It's really the same as being killed myself. If though
I can keep my morality I will reach the happiness that I've lived all these lives
to find. So if to keep my morality now I must let him kill me, then let it be so.
I will never give up these morals.

In short, if it comes down to choosing between giving up your life, and letting
this morality degenerate, you had surely better choose the first. The one thing
here in this birth that you cherish above all else is your own life. What you
are requesting from your Lama is that he or she grant you the power to always
keep your vows and pledges properly; that you reach a point where you cherish
these commitments infinitely more than your own precious life.
XII. Meditating on the Two Secret Stages

GSUM PA DAM TSIG DANG SDOM PA LA GNAS NAS LAM RIM PA GNYIS BSGOM PA'I TSUL NI,
This brings us to the third Step to training oneself in the secret half of the
bodhisattva activities, which is how to meditate upon the two stages of this
path, while one continues to maintain his pledges and vows. This Step too is
presented in a single verse of the root text.

,DE NAS RGYUD SDE'I SNYING PO RIM GNYIS KYI,

Bless me next
To realize precisely
The crucial points
Of both the stages,
The essence of
The secret ways.
Grant me then
To practice as
The Holy One has spoken,
Putting all my effort in
And never leaving off
The Practice of the Four Times,
Highest that there is.

,SKYABS SKU GSUM RANG NGO SHES BAR MDZOD,
One may wonder, "Suppose I am able to maintain my vows and pledges; what
must I do after that?" The highest of Victors, Kelsang Gyatso, has spoken the
following:
The point
May be birth or death or the state between them.
The time
Most important for planting their seeds is now.

The way
To transform them is the practice of creation and completion.
The refuge
You must learn is the three final bodies themselves.91

What's being said here is that, first of all, you must continue to keep each and
every one of the secret vows and pledges, as explained above. Then you must
practice the very essence of the great sea of the secret ways. Here first is the
stage of creation, which is exemplified by a number of methods.

THA MAL GYI GNAS LUS LONGS SPYOD PHUNG KHAMS SKYE MCHED SOGS LA RANG GA BAR 'DZIN PA'I THA MAL GYI SNANG ZHEN DANG , SKYE SHI BAR DO THA MAL PA RNAMS KYANG   
We tend to see things in an ordinary way, we take them to be no more than
what they seem to us; we tend to grasp this way to the place where we live,
to our own body, to the things we own and use, and to things like the parts
that make up us, and the world: what we call the "heaps," the "categories," and
the "doors of sense."92
We have also always had to undergo an ordinary birth,
ordinary death, and ordinary passage between death and birth.

In the stage of creation we transform all these seemingly ordinary things and
events; we turn them into the three bodies of a victorious Buddha.93
We take
whatever presents itself to us: all that appears to our eyes, all that reaches our
ears, and all that comes in our thoughts, and we make it show itself as total
and absolute purity, as a galaxy of perfection, as great celestial mansions, as
holy angels, as a magical dance put on by our Lamas.

SEMS GSAL RIG GI NGO BO MTHONG BA TZAM LA LAM MTHON BOR 'KHRUL BA LTA BU   
As for the stage of completion, some mistakenly equate it with concentrating
solely on a meditation that involves the various channels and winds, and
which results in achieving a rather ordinary kind of inner heat. Others make
the error of thinking it is some high spiritual path when you succeed in
nothing more than perceiving how the essence of the mind is that it is aware
and knowing.

The real stage of completion though is not like this; rather, you take the
various winds which course through the body because of one's ordinary
conceptual thinking, and redirect them all into the central channel--in a
three-fold process of entrance, residence, and absorption. As a result a primal
state of mind arises, the clear light, the wisdom which is simultaneous. And
the power of this wisdom makes all of existence appear as the play of bliss and
emptiness.

In the path of the stage of completion then we meditate over and over on this
and related practices, until finally we are able to bring about the Union of the
holy body and holy mind: we reach the state of the Lord of the Secret World,
the Keeper of the Diamond.

All this makes it clear why we must study, and study well, the path that
includes both the secret stages. We will have to realize all the crucial points of
how to actually carry out these two stages. Our understanding must be
unerring; it must conform precisely with the true intent of Teacher, as revealed
in the secret texts, and the explanations of great and accomplished masters.

Then we must put forth all our efforts; that is, we must exert ourselves
continually and steadily, to the proper degree--not overdoing it, and not
underdoing it. These efforts should go towards following the Practice of the
Four Times of the day: daybreak, morning, afternoon and the early night. We
must make this practice the single highest activity that there is in our lives, and
try never to leave off doing it.

Now there are false teachings that some persons simply make up on their own,
out of an ignorant desire for gain. There are paths that are absolutely
backwards, and there are paths that will lead you astray. There are paths that
are infected by mistaken concepts from an old local religion, or from some
non-Buddhist faiths of ancient India, or anything of the like.

What we are requesting of our Lama here, said our Lama, is that he or she
grant us the power never to wander onto one of these paths. We are asking for
the strength to practice, in exactly the proper way, the instructions found in the
highest of spoken words. And these are the teachings of the "Holy One"
mentioned in the verse. These words refer to a person who can never deceive
us; a being who is incapable of lying; that ultimate meditator who keeps the
practice of the times: they refer to the victorious, transcendent Buddha.

THE CONCLUSION
XIII. A Request for Good Circumstances

RTZA BA'I GSUM PA LAM SGRUB PA'I MTHUN RKYEN 'GRUB PA DANG 'GAL RKYEN ZHI BAR GSOL BA 'DEBS PA NI,
This brings us to the third major division of the text, which is a request so that
we can attain all the favorable conditions for succeeding in the path, and also
stop all those circumstances that might keep us from success. This request is
contained in the single verse of the root text which follows.

(13)
Bless me, grant me that
The spiritual Guide
Who shows me this good road,
And all my true
Companions in this quest
Live long and fruitful lives.
Bless and grant me that
The rain of obstacles,
Things within me
Or outside me
That could stop me now,
Stop and end forever.

So there are these different sorts of spiritual paths, of widely varying quality:
some are totally correct, some are totally wrong, some slide off from right to
wrong, and on and on. You and I have access to a path which is pure, and
unmistaken, and free of any error. We can either enter it now or go off on
some wrong road that goes astray. If this second is our choice then we can try
to follow such a way for a thousand years, but it is an absolute impossibility
that we will derive from it any good or certain result.

The Great Fifth Dalai Lama has said,
It's quite nice when you consider
A teaching to be of your school
When the Lama who teaches it wears
A silk cap with the saffron stain.
But remember many are robbed
By the thief of wandering thoughts,
Left empty-handed of riches,
The unique word and the realizations
Passed down the Family line.94

These lines describe people in our school whose knowledge is so little that the
only difference they can see between followers of traditions such as the
Lineage of the Word or the Ancient Ones, and the tradition of the Virtuous
Way, is that some wear lama hats which are red and others wear caps of
yellow. People like this are unable to cite a single one of the unique, profound
features that distinguish the physical word and the mental realizations of our
teachings from those of the other traditions. These people are a disgrace to our
school.

Don't let yourself be one of these. For once in your many lifetimes you have
met up with a truly pure system, a school like purified gold. The beliefs that
it teaches have been perfectly refined and assayed, like gold that has been
through the fire, the shears, and the file. These tests have been carried out
with endless hardships by our Gentle Protector, Tsongkapa the Great, who has
delivered to us this precious essence of the teachings of the powerful beings
of Enlightenment.

We have met with this system, and we must see that a real meeting takes
place. We must find and take ourselves properly to a spiritual Guide, one who
is truly qualified, and who follows our tradition perfectly in both his viewpoint
and his practice. We should undertake to study the five great classics, the five
great volumes of the Word, and bring this study to its final end, thereby
coming to a firm and accurate understanding of how the two levels of reality
work.95

We must examine and resolve every question about how to put into practice
within our own lives that path where method and wisdom are ever
inseparable. We must, in short, ask for and receive teachings on the
immaculate system of the greater way; we must learn the various clarifications
of these teachings by our Lord Lama and his spiritual Sons, and by those who
have come after them; and we must hear the private advices passed along in
the oral tradition. And then finally we should use the traditional method to
master these teachings, in the three steps of learning, contemplation, and
meditation, each one always combined with the others.

'BRAS BU BZANG PO SANGS RGYAS KYI SAR 'GRO BA LAS GZHAN DU 'KHYOGS MED PAS LAM BZANG PO ZHES PA DE LTA BU LA BYA DGOS,
If we do all this we will win a good goal, for we will have found what the
verse calls the "good road": the path that leads to the land of Enlightenment, the
path that never wanders someplace else.

To succeed like this, to actually carry out the path described above--such a
good road in the way it combines the open and secret teachings--we will first
need to achieve the various conditions that are favorable for us. We'll need to
reach the state where our mind is perfectly pliable, and other such qualities.
Most of all we will need a spiritual Guide who can show us this road, and
companions in the quest--genuine friends of a like mind, who are true in keeping
each and every one of the Teacher's instructions.

   ZHABS ZUNG RDO RJE'I RANG BZHIN DU BRTAN CING ,
The first thing we are asking our Lama to grant us then is that these true
friends live long and fruitful lives, that their two legs remain planted here on
earth with the immutability of a diamond.

'GAL RKYEN GYI GTZO BO PHYI'I BAR GCOD RGYAL PO CHOS BZHIN DU MI SPYOD CING , GZHAN YANG CHOS BYED LA DGRA LDANG BA SOGS CHOS LAM DU MI GTONG BA DANG ,
Secondly we are requesting our Lama to bless and grant us, that every last bit
of the rain of obstacles which could ever appear might stop and end forever. The
first kind of obstacles are those things outside of us that could stop us now from
reaching our spiritual goals; the main ones would be living in a country where
the leaders behave in contradiction to the Dharma--or where they refuse to
allow people to enter the Way--by fighting against religion, or the like.

The second type of obstacles are those that are within; examples here would be
things like illnesses and harmful spirits that attack your body, or a mental
inability to direct your thoughts towards virtuous objects any way you want.

Our Lama noted lastly that for this and the preceding sections there were a
good number of essential points covered in traditional advices: what
visualizations to perform at each point, how to bring down a flow of nectar to
purify oneself, and so on. He said that we should learn these by referring to
descriptions found in the more detailed, practical presentations of the Steps of
the path.

XIV. A Prayer for Future Care

BZHI PA SKYE BA THAMS CAD DU BLA MAS RJES SU GZUNG STE SA LAM GYI 'BRAS BU MNGON DU BYED NUS PAR SMON PA NI,
We have come now to the fourth and final section in the text of the "Source of
All My Good." This is a prayer that, in all our future lives, we may be taken
under the care of a Lama, and so gain the strength to reach the end of the
various levels and paths. Here again the point is covered in a single verse of
the root text:

,SKYE BA KUN TU YANG DAG BLA MA DANG ,
,'BRAL MED CHOS KYI DPAL LA LONGS SPYOD CING ,
,SA DANG LAM GYI YON TAN RAB RDZOGS NAS,
,RDO RJE 'CHANG GI GO 'PHANG MYUR THOB 
SHOG,CES PA'I {SHl}OO KA GCIG GIS BSTAN,
(14)
In all my lives
May I never live
Apart from my perfect Lamas,
May I bask
In the glory
Of the Dharma.
May I fulfill
Perfectly
Every good quality
Of every level and path,
And reach then quickly
The place where I
Become myself
The Keeper of the Diamond.

MTSAN NYID DANG LDAN PA BLA MA BLO BZANG THUB DBANG RDO RJE 'CHANG CHEN PO DANG DUS SKAD CIG KYANG 'BRAL BA MED PAR,
The verse says, in all my lives--that is, in this and in all my future lives to
come--may I never live apart from my Lamas, may I never spend a moment
without them. These Lamas are "perfect": they are spiritual Guides who have
all the right qualifications; they are the great Lama Lobsang, Lord of the
Powerful, who is the Keeper of the Diamond.

MDO SNGAGS SAM, LTA SPYOD KYI GDAMS PA ZAB CING RGYA CHE BA'I CHOS KYI DPAL 'BYOR LA NGOMS PA MED PAR LONGS SPYOD CING ,
And in these lives may I bask in the glory of the Dharma: may I seek unceasingly
to drink of the Dharma either in the sense of the open and secret teachings, or
the teachings that are "deep" and "wide"--the instructions on correct view and
living the life of a bodhisattva.

BLA MAS JI LTAR BSTAN PA LTAR GYI LAM GYI RIM PA RNAMS NYAMS SU BLANGS PA LA BRTEN NAS SA BCU DANG LAM LNGA'I YON TAN MA LUS PA RAB BAM MCHOG TU GYUR PA STE LEGS PAR RDZOGS NAS,
May I then put into actual practice all the Steps of the path, exactly as these
Lamas have taught me to do. If I can do so then I will fulfil each and every
good quality of the ten levels and the five paths.96
And I will fulfil them just right,
which is to say perfectly, or to the highest degree which exists.

BLA MA BLO BZANG THUB DBANG RDO RJE 'CHANG GI GO 'PHANG TSE 'DI NYID DAM, DMA' MTHA' SKYE BA BDUN NAM, BCU DRUG NAS MA 'GYANGS PAR MYUR DU THOB PA'I SKAL BA CAN DU 'GYUR BAR SHOG CIG, CES SMON LAM BTAB PA STE,
And may I reach then the place where I become myself the Lama, Lobsang,
Lord of the Powerful Buddhas, the Keeper of the Diamond. May I do so quickly:
in this very life, or at least within seven lifetimes, or no more than sixteen.
Make thus a prayer that you can have the virtuous fortune to make all this
come true.

SKYE BA KUN TU SOGS KYI TSIGS BCAD 'DI YON TAN GZHIR GYUR MA'I MJUG GI BKA' RTZOM MIN YANG ,
This verse, the one that begins with the words "In all my lives," does not
appear at the end of the original text of the Source of All My Good.
Nonetheless, said our Lama, there is a reason why it is added here in
conclusion, and why I have given an explanation of it.97

RANG RES BSNGO SMON BYA SA'I YUL LA, DGE BA 'DI YIS SKYE BO KUN, , ZHES SOGS LTA BU SANGS RGYAS 'THOB PA'I RGYUR BSNGO BA,
Generally speaking, there are three different objects that you and I can pray
for: three goals towards which we can dedicate the power of a great good deed
such as the practice we have just completed. The first is to dedicate our
virtuous act so that it might turn into a cause for us to achieve Enlightenment.
An example of this kind of dedication would be the verse which starts with the
line, "By this virtue may all beings..."98

RGYAL SRAS SMON LAM G{NGg}A'A'I KLUNG RNAMS NI, , ZHES SOGS LTA BU BSTAN PA RGYAS PA'I RGYUR BSNGO BA,
We can secondly dedicate our good deed to become a cause for the teachings
to spread in the world. A typical verse here would be the one that starts with
"The prayers of bodhisattva princes, as many as the drops of water in the
Ganges..."99

STON PA BLA NA MED PA'I BSTAN PA DANG , , ZHES SOGS LTA BU BLA MAS RJES SU 'DZIN PA'I RGYUR BSNGO BA STE GSUM LAS,
The third way to dedicate a great goodness is so that it brings ourselves and
others to be taken under the care of a Lama. Here there are verses like the one
with the line about the "matchless Word of the Teacher."100

BLA MAS RJES SU BZUNG NA SNGA MA GNYIS RANG SHUGS KYIS 'ONG BAS NA, 'DIR PHYI MA LTAR BYED PA BSNGO SMON GYI SDOMS CHEN PO YIN PAS, RANG PHYOGS KYI MKHAS GRUB GONG MA 
MANG PO'I GSUNG RGYUN PHYAG BZHES LTAR MJUG THOGS 'DIR SBYAR NAS BSHAD PA YIN GSUNGS,
Once a Lama has taken us into his or her care, the other two goals come then
of their own accord. For this reason, any verse dedicated to the third kind of
goal is a brief and powerful combination of both dedication and prayer. And
this is why the custom prescribed by a great many wise and accomplished
saints of our past lineage has been to attach this verse at the end of the work.

And so I have finished fully offering up to you all this my explanation of the
lines known as the Begging for a Mountain of Blessings. It is but a brief
explanation, barely enough to avoid losing the basic outline.
This Mountain of Blessings contains the cream of the holy thoughts of our gentle
protector, the great Tsongkapa. It is an extraordinary instruction; it packs a
tremendous amount of meaning into but a very few words. In a sense it rips
open and lays bare the innermost heart of all the 84,000 great masses of
teachings delivered by the Buddhas.

As I mentioned above, the works called Open Door to the Highest Path and the
Source of All My Good were composed by our Lord Lama and delivered as a
supplication above the hermitage of the Victor, near the monastery of Radreng,
which stands to the north.101
Once he had made his supplication, the precious Tsongkapa found himself face
to face with each and every Lama of the lineage of the teachings on the Steps
on the path to Buddhahood. At the same moment many auspicious signs
occurred which portended how the Lord would elucidate these same teachings,
making them as clear to us as the Sun in the sky. These and other great deeds
would he perform, deeds both powerful and effective in furthering the
teachings and the needs of living beings.
Each and every one of us here, those of great intellect and those of lesser, must
all emulate the life of the Lord Lama, whose mighty activities spread as far as
space itself does. We must do whatever we can to see that these instructions
on the Steps of the path to Buddhahood take root and flourish within the
minds of ourselves and others.

   SBYOR CHOS DANG DGA' LHA SOGS KYI SGO NAS BSAGS SBYANG GSOL 'DEBS NAN TAN BYED PA SNGON DU BTANG ,
To accomplish this we must first carry out certain preliminaries: we must
collect the power of great good deeds, clean ourselves of our past bad deeds,
and make a request to our Lamas for strength. For this we will need a
practice, something like the text called the Preliminary Practices, or else the
Thousand Angels.102

NYUNG MTHA' YANG GZHUNG 'DI TZAM GYI TSIG DON LA 'DRIS PAR BYAS TE, BSHAR SGOM GYIS BAG CHAGS 'JOG PA TSUN LA NAN TAN DU 'BAD PA DANG ,
At the very least we should acquaint ourselves thoroughly with the meaning
of the verses of this very brief work. We must make great efforts in a wide
variety of related practices, beginning with review meditation to plant desirable
seeds in the stream of our mind.

THU'U BKVAN CHOS KYI NYI MA'I GSUNG LAS, THOS RGYU'I CHOS DE GANG , DE THOS PA'I TSUL JI LTAR ZHE NA, CHOS NI BLANG DOR GYI GNAD LA TSAD MAR GYUR PA SANGS RGYAS NYAG GCIG YIN PAS   
Remember here the words of Tuken Chukyi Nyima:
What is the Dharma we should learn? And how are we to learn
it? There is one and only one being who sees with perfect
accuracy each and every crucial point of what we should take up
and what we should abandon; this being is the Buddha.

Therefore the Dharma that we choose to learn should be the
Lamp of the Path by Lord Atisha, and works like the longer and
shorter presentations of the Steps which clarify his true intent.
The reason is that these instructions present in their totality the
keys which the Buddha himself taught in the open and secret
teachings, for actually carrying out the Dharma in one's own life.

It's true that we could choose a different way and devote
ourselves in the short term to learning all those weird little scraps
of Dharma that somebody supposedly found under the ground,
or supposedly fell out of the sky into somebody's lap, or
supposedly got handed down by word of mouth from some
ancestors of ancient times.

In the long run though all these can only deceive us. This is
precisely what happened with great holy beings of the past,
authentic masters such as Milarepa and Kyungpo.103
For a time
they deigned to study such works, but later on they were forced
to discard them like so much manure, and go on to seek a
different Dharma, one that would actually make them
enlightened.104

This too we learn from the lips of Changkya Rolpay Dorje:
It's true that
In the past
Buddhas beyond all counting
Have spoken
Perfect Dharmas,
By the millions, in multitudes.
Yet where else
Is a book
Like the Steps to Buddhahood,

The eloquent

Where he

Of Buddhas of Power
And combines their intent
Into one, with nothing left out at all.

develop the path of the two secret stages. Work at them until you achieve an

And so ends this very brief explanation of the Source of All My Good. It was
compiled primarily from a series of notes taken on the 22nd day of the fourth
month according to the Mongol system, in the year of the water monkey
[1932], at the retreat house known as Tashi Chuling.114
The notes are of a teaching delivered by that God of a Secret World, the
Protector of All Around Him, the Lord, the Magnificent Keeper of the
Diamond: Pabongka, whose kindness knows no equal. At the time he had
consented to confer a secret initiation upon a group of some thirty very
fortunate disciples, including among them the good and glorious Lama of
Golok, Jampel Rolpay Lodru, as well as Ganggiu Trulku Rinpoche, the son of
Sholkang.115

A number of empowerments and instructions upon them were given, centered
on the Five Angels of the outer secret world, as well as other aspects of the
secret practice of Highest Bliss, according to the tradition of Gantapada. The
present explication was granted as the required preliminary to the initiation.

There were also a number of other occasions on which we received brief but
very profound instructions on this teaching directly from this very Keeper of
the Diamond. For my own benefit, so that I would be able to retain these
advices, I had taken down some brief notes and kept several sets of them in
my possession. It had always been my intention to organize them into a single
work at some later point in time.

The notes came to the attention of the esteemed Yangdzom Tsering, a high
lady of noble family. She is one of the great religious sponsors of our land; her
faith in the teachings of Lobsang, the King of Buddhas,116
and in the Lamas and
disciples who keep these teachings, is totally unbreakable, unequalled,
unshakable as the diamond mountain at the center of the universe.

This noble lady insisted vehemently that I should with all haste come out with
a manuscript of the notes which would immediately be carved onto
woodblocks and printed. This duty I undertook, not daring to drag my feet
or delay the project even so long as it would take to offer the text to others for
proofing, editing, and other such tasks.

Along with this encouragement came a second motivation, which was my own
desire to benefit fellow disciples whose intellect might be as feeble as the one
I possess. And so in a great rush I have put together this treatise, combining

together all my sets of notes, and the most essential points of whatever I
myself was able to grasp with certainty from what he taught.

waning of the moon in the month of wo, in the year of the fire monkey

Notes to Reading Ten
60
Go forth now and defeat them: These lines are found in the Great Fifth's famous
presentation on the Steps of the path, entitled "Word of the Gentle One." They
occur as a poetic interlude between sections of the work's prose philosophical
presentation, a device favored as well by His Holiness the First Dalai Lama.
"Mental afflictions" are essentially bad thoughts, and constitute a basic source
of all our suffering. Their primary characteristic is to disturb our peace of
mind, and linguistically as well their name in Sanskrit, klesha, comes from a
verbal root meaning "to distress." Although the mental afflictions are nearly
countless, the six primary ones are desire, anger, pride, ignorance, harmful
doubt, and wrong views. See Prof. Whitney's Roots of the Sanskrit Language,
and Kedrup Tenpa Dargye's "Overview of the Perfection of Wisdom."
61
Six forms of life: That is, the six different possible types of rebirth: as a
hellbeing, a craving spirit, an animal, a human, someone nearly a pleasure
being, or a full pleasure being. See also note 37.
62
Three different kinds of suffering: The illustrious Kedrup Tenpa Dargye explains
them as follows in his Overview of the Perfection of Wisdom:
What we call "pervasive" suffering is the subtle condition of
change, the fact that the physical, mental, and other parts of
ourselves which we have taken on cannot remain, but begin to
change from the moment after they come into existence. The
suffering of change is typified by the pleasant sensation of the
taste of a fine meal. The suffering of suffering, outright suffering,
would be something like the painful sensation of a backache.
There is, by the way, a good reason for calling the first of these
"pervasive" suffering: this is a kind of pain which pervades each
and every thing produced by karma and mental afflictions, and
pervades too all three realms of cyclic existence. Moreover, this
particular suffering pervades each of the other two kinds.
63
Stop desire for this life: Also found in the Master's Three Principal Paths.
64
Lineage of the Word: The new and older schools of the Keepers of the Word,
the Kadampas, are explained at note 29. "Lineage of the Word" is a translation
of the word Kagyu, the name of one of the four great traditions of Tibetan
Buddhism.

65
You can't be sure you will live: The Victor Yang Gonpa (1213-1258) was a
famed early writer and practitioner of Tibetan Buddhism, and is known for a
group of works called the "Hermit Cycle." He is one of the founding fathers
of the "Drukpa" or "Dragon" lineage of the tradition of the Kagyu: the "Lineage
of the Word." For a full account of his life, see Prof. George N. Roerich's
translation of the Blue Annals, a history of Buddhism by Shunnu Pel, the
Master Translator of Gu.
66
Urges himself to perfect his practice: A catalog from the Kokonor region of Tibet
contains two references to a book entitled The Tree of Faith Aplenty: Urging
Myself to Perfect My Practice, and states that it was composed by Drom
Gyalway Jungne, otherwise known as Dromton Je--Lord Atisha's foremost
disciple.
67
Such a house of horrors: The lines are found in a beautiful short piece entitled A
Song of Deep Despair, from a collection of mental trainings by this seventh of
the Dalai Lamas. The quotation is also found in Pabongka Rinpoche's Gift of
Liberation.
68
Nirvana beyond both extremes: Refers to the nirvana attained by a fully
enlightened Buddha, who eliminates every form of spiritual obstacle, and is
thus free of both the extreme of living in the cycle of suffering life, and the
extreme of staying in a lower, personal nirvana. See the great Kedrup Tenpa
Dargye's Analysis of the Perfection of Wisdom.
69
They sing the praises of morality: The circumstances of the composition of these
lines in praise of morality were especially joyful. Je Tsongkapa had sent one
of his favorite disciples, Tsako Ngawang Drakpa, to eastern Tibet in order to
teach and establish new monasteries. Upon the ordination of the first monks
in the area of Gyalmo Rong, the disciple wrote a letter to the Master informing
him of the event. These words are from an exquisite epistle which Je
Tsongkapa sent in reply.
70
The various vows of freedom: Refers to the eight sets of vows found in the
Buddhist scriptures; three are for laymen, and five for the ordained. Generally
speaking they are called "vows of freedom" because, by observing them
carefully, one can reach the freedom of nirvana. Perhaps the clearest and most
concise presentation of the eight is found in Je Tsongkapa's own Essence of the
Ocean of Discipline.
71
Comes to rip out the life: Lobsang Chukyi Gyaltsen (1567?-1662) was the first
of the great Panchen Lamas and a renowned philosopher, historian, and
statesman--as well as teacher of the great Fifth Dalai Lama. The lines are
found in a short piece entitled Divine Nectar for Exposing the Harmful Things I
Have Done in the Past, and for Restoring Myself to Spiritual Health, by Relying on
the Antidotes to Bad Deeds, from the Present Moment On.

72
Fill the reaches of space itself: This quotation can be found in Pabongka
Rinpoche's commentary to the Three Principal Paths, and in numerous other
works on the Steps to the path.
73
Flourishes even more: The lines are found in Master Shantideva's classic
manual for bodhisattvas.
74
Those great beings who meditate: The verses are from the Lamp on the Path, Lord
Atisha's famed prototype for Tibetan texts on the Steps to Buddhahood. They
are also quoted in the early Steps of the Teaching by Geshe Drolungpa.
75
The Wish for enlightenment is the central beam: The verse appears in Je
Tsongkapa's Songs of My Spiritual Life.
76
Train your mind in the proper progression: The texts on the Steps to
Buddhahood state that the great Wish for enlightenment can equally be
developed by using either of the methods mentioned. The "seven-part,
cause-and-effect instruction" comes down to us from Lord Buddha through
masters such as Chandrakirti, Chandragomi, and Shantarakshita. It involves
a preliminary step, developing neutrality towards all other beings, and then
seven parts, the last being a result of the first six. The seven are:
(1) Recognize that all beings have, in past lives, been your
own mother.
(2) Contemplate the kindness they showed you.
(3) Develop a desire to repay them.
(4) Find a kind of love where every other living being
looks as lovely to you as a mother's only son.
(5) Feel a strong compassion for them, a wish that they
could escape every kind of pain.
(6) Resolve to help them escape, through your own
personal effort, by any means necessary.
(7) This then brings you to the Wish to achieve
enlightenment for the sake of every living being.
The practice of "exchanging self and others" comes down to us from the
Buddha through Master Shantideva, and means to replace one's concern for his
own welfare with a concern for the welfare of others. Both methods combine
in the teachings of Lord Atisha, Je Tsongkapa, and the Lamas of their lineage.
See Pabongka Rinpoche's Gift of Liberation.
77
All six perfections: The six Buddhist perfections are giving, morality,
controlling anger, enjoying good deeds, meditative concentration, and wisdom.
One important source for the six is Master Chandrakirti's Entering the Middle
Way, with chapters devoted to each.

78
Avoiding the ten bad deeds: See note 59 for the ten.
79
Three sets of vows: The freedom vows have been discussed above; see note 70.
The bodhisattva vows consist of 18 root vows and 46 secondary vows by which
one commits him or herself to the service of other beings. The secret vows are
undertaken for the purpose of attaining enlightenment in this life, in order to
benefit all sentient kind. See Pabongka Rinpoche's Gift of Liberation.
80
Amassing merit and wisdom: These two huge collections of good deeds and
knowledge within one's mind stream act as the causes for the physical form
and the omniscient state of a Buddha, respectively. See Pabongka Rinpoche's
commentary to Je Tsongkapa's Three Principal Paths.
81
Five problems to meditation: The texts on the Steps to Buddhahood describe in
detail the concept of five problems which occur as a person attempts to
develop the perfect concentration known as meditative quietude. These five
are countered by eight corrective measures, and lead the meditator through
nine different states, with four modes. Separating the Middle and the Extremes
is one of the works granted to Master Asanga in the 4th century by Maitreya,
the future Buddha. It outlines these components of meditation in a very brief
way and is used as the basis for later presentations.
The first of the five problems is called "laziness," a lack of motivation even to
sit down and start trying to develop perfect concentration. It is countered by
the first four of the corrective measures. Here one begins by developing (1)
"faith," which means a clear understanding of the benefits of concentration.
Once they are aware of these benefits, the meditator begins to (2) "aspire" to
achieve them, which provides the impetus for (3) great "effort." The result of
these three is (4) a kind of physical and mental "pliancy" which allows one to
meditate easily. Practicing then becomes enjoyable, which is a natural antidote
for the initial hesitation to begin meditating.
The second of the problems likely to arise in meditation is "forgetting the
instruction," which here refers to losing the object which one has chosen to
meditate upon. The correction for this is "remembering," which means trying
to keep the mind on the object tightly, as you would hold a rope to keep it
from slipping.
Only now, once the object is within one's mental grasp, can the third problem
occur: dullness and agitation. Dullness is a heaviness of body and mind; in its
gross form, one succeeds in fixing the mind but has no clarity--none of the
bright, focussed feeling one gets for example while concentrating on a good
book. With the subtle form of dullness one enjoys both fixation and clarity,
but the clarity lacks intensity. This leads to perhaps the most common error
in meditation, marked by long periods of dimly focussed dullness, a fuzzy
good feeling easily mistaken for real concentration.

Agitation, the second part of the third problem, occurs when the mind is
distracted to an attractive object. The correction for both sides of the problem
is known as "mindfulness," which simply means watching your own mind to
catch yourself turning dull or agitated.
Although mindfulness may detect a problem occurring during meditation, one
may fail to act upon the alarm, and this is the fourth problem. It is overcome
by taking action, by tightening down on the meditation object in the case of
subtle dullness, and by lightening up when this goes too far and causes a
reaction of agitation. The idea is to maintain the proper tension, like tuning
a guitar string: not too loose, and not too tight. The correction swings to either
side of the problem, whichever necessary, as the driver of a car constantly
corrects to left and right in order to keep a straight line.
At some point a straight line is achieved, and the concentration is running fine
on its own. Now the fifth problem can occur: the fault of correcting when
there is nothing to correct. This problem's natural antidote--the eighth--is to
leave things alone.
The meditator passes through nine different states during the above process:
1) Fixing the mind: Moments of fixation on the object,
with no continuity. Time off the object is more than
time on the object.
2) Fixing the mind continuously: Some ability to keep the
mind on the object for a continuous period.
During these two states the mind is in the first of the four modes: engaging
only with a conscious effort to focus.
3) Fixing the mind with patches: Mind kept on the object
for longer periods, with brief gaps which are
quickly patched.
4) Fixing the mind closely: No longer possible to lose the
object, but dullness and agitation still very strong.
5) Controlling the mind: Gross dullness and agitation are
overcome. Special problems with subtle dullness
due to excessive effort to focus the mind inward.
6) Stilling the mind: Special problems with subtle agitation
due to steps taken to stop subtle dullness.
7) Stilling the mind completely: With few exceptions, all
dullness and agitation stopped. Infrequent
occurrences of the two are countered by application
of effort.

During these last five states the mind is in the second of the four modes:
engaging but with interruptions, caused by dullness and agitation.
8) Focussing the mind single-pointedly: Slight initial effort
is enough to prevent dullness and agitation for the
entire remaining length of a meditation session.
During this eighth state the mind is in the third of the four modes: engaging
without interruptions.
9) Balancing the mind: No effort at all required to start
and remain in deep, single-pointed meditation.
During the ninth state the mind is in the last of the four modes: engaging
effortlessly. This last state is also known as "approximate quietude"; it
becomes true meditative quietude when one achieves true physical and mental
pliancy.
The preceding discussion is based on Pabongka Rinpoche's Gift of Liberation,
with additional material from Je Tsongkapa's Greater Steps.

The fact that nothing has any nature of its own: This refers to the Buddhist
concept of emptiness, or voidness, and is easily misunderstood. For a full
discussion, see Pabongka Rinpoche's own explanation in Je Tsongkapa's
Principal Teachings of Buddhism.
83
The three principal paths: These three constitute an essential background,
without which the study of the Mountain of Blessings would be incomplete.
They are presented fully in Pabongka Rinpoche's elucidation of Je Tsongkapa's
work entitled the Three Principal Paths.
84
Listeners, self made Buddhas, and bodhisattvas: See note 15.
85
Three "countless" periods of years: The word "countless" here actually refers to
a specific number--1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,
000,000,000,000,000,000. The length of an "eon" is variously described in
Buddhist scripture, and is tied to cycles in the lifespans of beings; suffice to say
it entails millions of years.
86
Eight great attainments: These are to gain "the sword," which allows one to
travel anywhere; "the pill," which enables you to become invisible or assume
any outer form; "the eye ointment," which helps you see minute or very distant
objects; "swift feet," the ability to travel at high speeds; "taking essence," an
ability to live off nothing but tiny bits of sustenance; "sky walk," the ability to
fly; "disappearing," or invisibility; and "underground," the power to pass
through solid ground like a fish through water. The Great Dictionary describes

each of the eight in a separate entry. An expanded presentation of these
attainments is found in Lord Atisha's autocommentary to "Light on the Path."
87
The secret and bodhisattva vows: Summaries of these higher vows are found in
many of the texts for daily recitation, such as the Practice for Six Times a Day.
The book of advice mentioned above, the String of Shining Jewels, is a concise,
exquisite piece by Geshe Tsewang Samdrup of Drepung Monastery, probably
from the 18th century.
88
Within seven lives this person will reach: Je Tsongkapa, in the Golden Harvest of
Attainments just mentioned, also uses this quotation. He mentions his source
as a reference to the Treasure within Master Saraha's Difficult Points on the Secret
Teaching of the Skull.
89
Within the length of sixteen lives: The quotation is from the String of Light for
the Three Kinds of Vows, a short piece by Master Vibhuti Chandra found in the
Tengyur collection of early Indian commentaries. The lines just preceding
those here, by the way, state that:
If he also does his meditation
A person will reach enlightenment
Here in the very same life.
Je Tsongkapa cites the lines on the sixteen lives in both his Golden Harvest and
in an epistle sent to a disciple named Kashi Dzinpa, Sherab Pel Sangpo. The
great scholar of the secret teachings, Shaluwa Rinchen Lobsang Kyenrab (late
19th century), also speaks of the maximum of sixteen lifetimes.
90
The goal is reached: Je Tsongkapa again these lines on p. 471 of his Golden
Harvest--the following words are included in the original:
By force of meditation and the like,
A person achieves the goal in this same life.
91
Birth or death or the state between: The lines by His Holiness the Seventh Dalai
Lama are found in a letter of advice to one Rabjampa Gendun Drakpa.
92
The "heaps," the "categories," and the "doors of sense": These are three ways of
dividing the parts to ourselves and our world; the classic presentation of them
is found throughout the first chapter of Master Vasubandhu's Treasure House
of Knowledge.
The five "heaps" consist of our physical form, our feelings, our ability to
discriminate, parts of us not covered in the other four heaps, and our
consciousness. They are called "heaps" because each one consists of a large
group of different things.

The eighteen "categories" are our five physical senses and our mental sense,
along with the corresponding six objects and six consciousnesses. (For
example, the physical sense of the eye, visual objects, and consciousness of
what we see.) They are called "categories" in the sense of "types."
The twelve "doors of sense" are the six senses and their six objects. They are
"doors of sense" in that they provide a cause or doorway through which the
six types of consciousness arise. These three different presentations of the
divisions to us and our world are made to fit varying types of students.
93
Three bodies of a victorious Buddha: The three bodies or parts of a Buddha are
known as the Dharma Body, the Body of Enjoyment, and the Body of
Emanation. The Dharma Body consists of the Buddha's omniscience, his state
of having ended all impure qualities, and his or her emptiness. The Body of
Enjoyment is the physical body of the Buddha in his paradise, and the Body
of Emanation is the form which he projects to this and other planets to help
living beings.
94
But remember many are robbed: The lines are found in His famed work on the
Steps to Buddhahood entitled Word of the Gentle One.
95
How the two levels of reality work: The five great books have been described
above at note 24. The "two levels of reality" refer to what are usually called
"deceptive truth" and "ultimate truth." Both are valid, and all objects have
both. The dependence of objects (especially in the sense of depending upon
the names and concepts we apply to them) is their conventional or deceptive
truth. Their appearance is "deceptive" because to the minds of normal people
they appear to be something other than what they actually are. The "ultimate"
truth of objects is their lack of non-dependence, and is first seen directly in the
all-important meditative state known as the "path of seeing." Seeing this truth
directly acts immediately to stop the process through which we suffer.
96
Ten levels and five paths: The ten levels here refer to ten stages at which a
bodhisattva attains an exceptional ability to perform the various perfections;
they begin with the first direct perception of emptiness.
The five paths represent progressive stages towards the goal of nirvana and
omniscience. The first, called the "path of accumulation," begins when a
practitioner develops true renunciation for the suffering of life. For a person
of the greater way this is accompanied by a full-fledged version of the Wish
to gain enlightenment for the sake of others. The second path is called the
"path of preparation," and is marked by increasingly refined intellectual
understandings of emptiness.
The third path is the "path of seeing," named after the all-important initial
direct perception of emptiness. During the subsequent stages of this path one

also perceives directly what are called the Four Noble Truths of suffering, the
cause of suffering, the end of suffering, and the way to the end of suffering.
The fourth path is the "path of habituation," where one familiarizes himself
repeatedly with the realizations of the previous path, in order to permanently
remove all mental afflictions and their propensities. This state itself is known
as the "path of no more learning," the fifth path. For a practitioner of the lower
way this is nirvana, and for one of the greater way it represents the full
enlightenment of a Buddha.
The subject of the ten levels and five paths is treated in detail in a standard
type of textbook known as the "Presentation of the Levels and Paths."
97
Added here in conclusion: In general the verse is attached to many prayers and
rituals as a fitting conclusion. As for dating its first appearance, the verse is
not found in the Mountain commentary of Tsechokling Yeshe Gyeltsen (1713-
1793), nor in that of Akya Yangchen Gaway Lodru (c. 1760). It does though
appear in the explanations of the Second Jamyang Shepa, Konchok Jikme
Wangpo (1728-1791), and Keutsang Lobsang Jamyang Monlam (b. 1689).
98
By this virtue may all beings... These are actually the final lines of Master
Nagarjuna's Sixty Verses of Reasoning, and are often used nowadays as a prayer
of dedication after the good deed of listening to a teaching. The entire verse
reads:
By this virtue may all beings
Gather the masses of merit and wisdom.
May they achieve the ultimate two [bodies of a Buddha]
That the merit and the wisdom produce.
99
The prayers of bodhisattva princes: The original lines are from the third part of
a verse description of his spiritual life by Je Tsongkapa entitled Noble Hopes.
This section is called the "Dedication of All that I Had Done, that the Word
should Flourish in the World," and the entire verse reads as follows:
The prayers of bodhisattva princes,
As many as the drops of water in the Ganges,
Are all--it is spoken--included within
A prayer that the Dharma be preserved.
Thus I take the core of virtue
Created by the good I have done
And dedicate it to the spread
Of the Buddha's teaching in the world.

I think of all I've done,
My hopes in life were noble;
Oh you have been kind to me,
Holy Treasure House of knowledge.
The Treasure House here, by the way, refers to Gentle Voice--Je Tsongkapa's
tutor.
100
The teacher unsurpassed: The lines are often appended to prayers and
recitation texts; see for example the version of Je Tsongkapa's Songs of My
Spiritual Life. The entire verse reads:
The fact that in my life I've been able
To meet with the matchless Word of the Teacher
Is my Lama's kindness, so this good I've done
I dedicate to the cause that every
Living being might find himself
Under a holy Lama's care.
101
The hermitage of the Victor: The "Victor" here is Dromton Je, founder of
Radreng Monastery--which is located to the north of Lhasa city. See note 16
for details.
102
The Thousand Angels: The Thousand Angels of the Heaven of Bliss is an
extremely important devotional work and meditation centered on Je
Tsongkapa. The preliminary practices are a method to prepare oneself
properly for a meditation session; a typical version would be that of Pabongka
Rinpoche's root Lama, Jampel Hlundrup.
103
Milarepa and Kyungpo: The great Milarepa (1040-1123) is perhaps the most
famed meditator and writer of spiritual poetry in Tibet. In his early years he
practiced black magic and used it to harm a great many people. Later he
regretted this wrong path and became one of the greatest Buddhist masters of
his time, spending a full nine years in intense meditation to achieve the
ultimate goal. The sage Kedrup Kyungpo Neljor (b. 978) was originally a
practitioner of the shamanistic Bon religion prevalent in Tibet prior to the
arrival of Buddhism. Not reaching the goals he sought, Kedrup Kyungpo
travelled to Nepal and India, mastering the Buddhist teachings. He founded
numerous monasteries in Tibet and started the Shangpa school of the tradition
known as the Kagyu: the Lineage of the Word. For thumbnail biographies see
the Great Dictionary.
104
Actually make them enlightened: Original source of quotation not found.
Tuken Chukyi Nyima (1737-1802) was the third incarnation of the Tuken
lineage. His studies were influenced by such eminent Lamas as the Seventh
Dalai Lama, the Third Panchen Lama, the great historian and grammarian

Sumpa Kenpo Yeshe Peljor, the philosopher Changkya Rolpay Dorje, and most
importantly Purbuchok Ngawang Jampa, known for his writings on history
and the secret teachings. Perhaps the most famous of Tuken's lucid treatises
is his Survey of the Schools of Philosophy.
105
Those with the goodness to hear it: Original source of quotation not found.
Changkya Rolpay Dorje (1717-1786) was the second incarnation of the Line of
the Changkya Lamas, and is said in fact to have been a former life of Pabongka
Rinpoche himself. He was Lama to the Emperor of China and instrumental in
the publication of the entire Buddhist canon in Mongolian.
106
Just what our Lord Lama has taught: The lines are found in a short piece which
describes how to meditate on the impermanence of life. Gungtang Tenpay
Dronme (1762-1823) spent his early years at the monastery of Labrang Tashi
Kyil in east Tibet, and then studied under leading masters of his day at the
great Drepung Monastery in Lhasa. He displayed extraordinary talent and
received the highest scholastic degree at the age of twenty-two. His collected
works span a wide range of subjects including the open and secret teachings
of Buddhism, the fine arts, medicine and astrology, and classical grammar.
107
One of the Sugarcane: An epithet of the historical Buddha, who was born into
a group of people called "Those of the Sugarcane."
108
The royal Regent, the Invincible Savior, and Gentle Voice: The Regent and Savior
mentioned here refer to Loving One, Maitreya, the future Buddha who has
been put as regent of the Heaven of Bliss by the present Buddha, Shakyamuni.
The lineage of far-reaching deeds motivated by the Wish for enlightenment has
come down from Lord Buddha through him, and the lineage of the profound
view of emptiness has been passed down to us through Gentle Voice,
Manjushri.
109
Descended in a perfect stream: The lines here are describing exactly the same
lineages to which Je Tsongkapa made his original supplication when he wrote
the text of the Mountain of Blessings. The third-century Indian masters
Nagarjuna and Aryadeva are sometimes referred to as the "Father and Son,"
teacher and disciple for the philosophy of emptiness. Master Asanga is also
known as the "Brother" since he and the illustrious Vasubandhu had the same
mother. Both Nagarjuna and Asanga are spoken of us as "innovators" in the
sense that they were able to elucidate the scriptures without relying on a
previous innovator, and were prophesied as such by the Buddha himself. This
subject is treated at length in monastic presentations on the perfection of
wisdom such as the Analysis of Kedrup Tenpa Dargye.
110
The kindness of one great God: The "God" here refers to Atisha, who with his
principal disciple Dromton Je was chiefly responsible for introducing the
teachings on the Steps into Tibet. See also note 19.

111
Sixty most glorious tones: Refers to sixty different remarkable traits of the
speech of the Buddha. The most important of these, as Pabongka Rinpoche
himself notes in his Gift of Liberation, is the spontaneous ability to speak in a
single language, Sanskrit, which is heard by each disciple as his own native
tongue.
112
The mother of the moon: The image has a multitude of meanings but, most
importantly here, refers to the great outer ocean of Buddhist cosmology. The
floor of the ocean was believed in Tibet to be the source of precious jewels.
113
Way of the Heaven of Bliss: Refers to the teaching tradition of Je Tsongkapa.
The "serpents" mentioned here are the mythical "nagas;" their home was in
bodies of water, and it was believed that, so long as they remained in them,
the water would never dry up. Here the mighty Lamas of the Lineage are the
serpents; because of them, the ocean of the teachings like the present book
remain.
114
The retreat house known as Tashi Chuling: A hermitage favored by Pabongka
Rinpoche and located above an outcropping near Lhasa named "Pabongka
Rock." This was the location of Pabongka Monastery, and as a child the
Rinpoche was recognized as the reincarnation of this monastery's abbot.
115
Son of Sholkang: Sholkang was a powerful government official who assisted
the regent of Tibet from the year 1907, and passed away in 1926.
116
Lobsang, the King of Buddhas: Meaning Je Tsongkapa, Lobsang Drakpa.
117
The Meeting of the Angels: A biweekly celebration of the Angel of Diamond.
The monastery of Den is located in Kham, east Tibet. The Hlalu were a
well-known aristocratic of old Tibet; their principal holdings were located to
the northwest of Lhasa, on the road to Drepung Monastery.
