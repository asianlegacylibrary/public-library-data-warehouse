Reading One: Why Study the Art of Reasoning?
Selection from the collected topics:
Why study the art of reasoning?
The first two selections here are from a monastic textbook entitled An Explanation
of the Science of Logic, included in the Advanced Path of Reasoning, a Section
from the "Key to the Logic Machine"--a Presentation of the Collected Topics
which Clarifies the Meaning of the Great Scriptures on Valid Perception (Tsad-
ma'i gzhung-don 'byed-pa'i bsdus-grva'i rnam-par bshad-pa rigs-lam 'phrul gyi lde'u-
mig las rigs-lam che-ba rtags-rigs kyi skor). This text was written by Purbuchok
Jampa Tsultrim Gyatso (1825-1901), who in his day held the position of Tutor to the
Dalai Lama.
Between the two sections is a very relevant snippet from the Overview of the
Perfection of Wisdom, composed by the great writer of textbooks for Sera Mey
Tibetan Monastery named Kedrup Tenpa Dargye (1493-1568).
***************
Our first selection discusses the importance of learning how to reason well:

,BLA MA DANG MGON PO 'JAM DPAL DBYANGS LA PHYAG 'TSAL LO,
I bow down to my Lama and my Protector, the glorious Gentle Voice
(Manjushri).

,'DIR RIGS PA'I SGO 'BYED BSDUS GRVA'I RNAM PAR BSHAD PA RIGS LAM 'PHRUL GYI LDE MIG LAS RIGS LAM CHE BA RTAGS RIGS KYI RNAM BZHAG BSHAD PA LA,
Here begins An Explanation of the Science of Logic, included in the Advanced Path
of Reasoning, a Section from the "Key to the Logic Machine," a Presentation of the
Collected Topics which opens the door to the art of reasoning.

,TSAD MAR GYUR PA 'GRO LA PHAN BZHED PA, STON PA BDE GSHEGS SKYOB LA PHYAG 'TSAL LO, , ZHES PA'I GZHUNG 'DIS BDAG CAG GI STON PA PHYI ROL PA'I STON PA LAS KHYAD PAR DU 'PHAGS PA'I STON PA TSAD MAR BSTAN TE, 'GRO LA PHAN BZHED PA, ZHES PAS, RANG RGYU BSAM SBYOR PHUN TSOGS LAS 'KHRUNGS PA'I PHYIR ZHES BSTAN,
Let us consider first the quotation [from Master Dharmakirti's Commentary on
Valid Perception] which says:
I bow down to the Teacher, the One Who has Gone to Bliss,
To the Protector, the one who is totally correct,
Who undertakes to benefit every living being.
The purpose of these lines is to show that our Teacher is a teacher who is
totally correct (Tib: tsad-ma; Skt: pramana), and a teacher who is infinitely
superior to those of non-Buddhist traditions. The reason here is that he
"undertakes to benefit every living being"; which is to say, he was created by
a very special cause--consummate thoughts and actions.

'O NA RANG RE'I STON PA LA YON TAN JI LTA BU MNGA' ZHE NA, BDE GSHEGS SKYOB ZHES PAS, RANG DON SPANGS PA PHUN TSOGS DANG , GZHAN DON RTOGS PA PHUN TSOGS GNYIS MNGA' BAS NA SKYOB PA BLA NA MED PAR BSTAN PA YIN TE, RNAM 'GREL LAS, RTOG PA'I DRA BA RNAM BSAL ZHING , , ZHES GSUNGS PA'I PHYIR,
"Just what," one may ask, "are the extraordinary qualities which our own
Teacher possesses?" This is answered in the words "the One Who has Gone
to Bliss, the Protector." Our Teacher possesses both a consummate form of all
that will benefit himself--that is, he has eliminated every negative thing within
himself; and he possesses as well a consummate form of all that will benefit
others--which is to say, he has realized all knowable things. As such he is
said to be a Protector surpassed by none other; for as the Commentary [on Valid
Perception] says, "He has smashed the web of ideas, and..."

DE LTAR RANG RE'I STON PA NI STON PA TSAD MA, DE'I LUNG RTOGS KYI BSTAN PA NI BSTAN PA RNAM DAG, DE'I LUNG LAS GSUNG PA'I TSAD MA MNGON RJES GNYIS NI 'JUG BYA'I TSAD MA RNAM DAG,
And so it is that our Teacher is a teacher who is totally correct; and that his
teaching is a teaching which is totally pure; and that the correct perceptions
described in his words--that is, the pair of direct and deductive
perception--are totally pure and correct methods of perception for us to use.
 RGYU BSAM SBYOR PHUN TSOGS NI NYAMS SU BLANG BYA'I LAM RNAM DAG TU RTOG GE'I TSIG DON BRGYAD KYI SGO NAS SGRUB PAR MDZAD, DES NA SGRUB NGAG DANG , SUN 'BYIN GYI RNAM BZHAG LA MKHAS PA'I SGO NAS RGYAL BA'I BSTAN PA 'DZIN PA DE NI, BSTAN 'DZIN GYI GTZO BO YIN TE, RIGS GTER LAS, DE LTA SGRUB DANG SUN 'BYIN GYI, , RIGS PA'I GZHUNG LUGS GANG GIS SHES, , MKHAS PA DE NI RDZOGS PA YI, , SANGS RGYAS KYI NI BSTAN PA 'DZIN, , ZHES GSUNGS PA'I PHYIR,
The causes that create the Buddha are consummate thoughts and actions.
Proving that these constitute a totally pure path that we should practice is
accomplished by using the eight different forms of logic. As such there is but
one main way of keeping the teachings of the victorious Buddha safe in the
world, and this is to become a master of the logical forms used to prove some
things and to disprove others. As the Goldmine of Reasoning [by the Sakya
Pandita, Kunga Gyeltsen (1182-1251)] says,
Suppose a person comes to understand
The scriptural tradition for how to reason:
This art of proving or disproving things.
A master like this is a person who keeps
The teachings of the totally enlightened
Buddhas safe here in the world.
***************

The role of faith versus the understanding that is born from the ability to reason
properly is stated clearly in many scriptures on the perfection of wisdom, including
the following:

GDUL BYA GNYIS KYIS YUM LA DANG BA SKYE TSUL DGOS PA DANG BCAS PA 'CHAD PA DANG , GZHI LAM RNAM GSUM BDEN PA'I SKYE MED KYI DON BSHAD PA GNYIS,
Here our discussion will have two parts: a description of the different ways in
which people gain feelings of admiration for the Mother [of the Buddhas--that
is, the perfection of wisdom] along with a discussion of the need to reach this
emotion; and an explanation of what it means when we say that developing
the three kinds of high knowledge--foundation knowledge, path knowledge,
and omniscience--has no true existence.

DANG PO LA KHA CIG, RE ZHIG DAD PA'I RJES SU 'BRANG BA RNAMS KYIS 'DI LA THE TSOM MED PAR MYUR DU RAB TU DANG BA SKYE'O ZHES PA'I SKABS NAS DNGOS BSTAN GYI RGYAN GYI GDUL BYA DBANG RTUL DAD PA'I RJES 'BRANG DE, RGYAN GYI CHED DU BYA BA'I GDUL BYA YIN ZER NA,
Here is the first of the two. Suppose someone makes the following claim:
Consider the section where the commentary makes this
statement: "At this particular point at least, those who follow
after faith develop, quite quickly, strong feelings of admiration
for it, beyond all doubt." There is a certain kind of disciple being
referred to directly here, and that is the one who is studying the
Ornament [of Realizations by Maitreya] and who is poor in his
intellectual capacity--the kind that follows a teaching because of
his or her faith alone. It is this kind of disciple for whom the
Ornament was designed.

DE MI 'THAD PAR THAL, RGYAN GYI CHED DU BYA BA'I GDUL BYA YIN NA THEG CHEN GYI RIGS CAN DBANG PO SHIN TU RNON PO YIN PAS KHYAB, THEG CHEN GYI RIGS CAN DBANG PO SHIN TU RNON PO LAM MA ZHUGS RNAMS KYIS MKHYEN GSUM GYI YON TAN BRJOD PA'I TSIG TZAM RGYU MTSAN DU BYAS PA MA YIN PAR GZHI LAM RNAM GSUM GANG ZAG DANG , CHOS KYI BDAG 
MED PA RIGS PA YANG DAG GIS GTAN LA PHAB NAS, TSAD MAS NGES PA LA BRTEN NAS YUM MKHYEN GSUM LA DANG BA DANG YID CHES KYI DAD PA BSKYED PA'I PHYIR,
But you are wrong in your assertion. It is always the case that, if a person is
one of those disciples for whom the Ornament was designed, then he or she is
a person who belongs to the greater way, and who possesses intellectual
abilities which are extremely high. Think about these people--the ones who
belong to the greater way and who possess an intellect which is very great.
They don't begin to feel admiration for the three kinds of high knowledge
simply based on the fact that someone has described to them the extraordinary
qualities that these three possess. Rather they use correct forms of reasoning
to come to a clear understanding of what the three--that is, foundation
knowledge, path knowledge, and omniscience--really are, and they do the
same to establish in their own minds the fact that neither people nor their
"things" [or parts] have any nature of their own. When they have in this way
come to actually see things through a valid form of perception, then they begin
to have feelings of admiration for the Mother, for the three types of high
knowledge--it is only then that they begin to have the kind of faith which
believes in the good qualities of its object.
***************
The second selection is a very famous quotation from scripture which is memorized by
every young monk who begins the geshe course in a Tibetan monastery. It describes
one of the ultimate reasons for studying the art of reasoning:

MDO LAS, GANG ZAG GIS GANG ZAG GI TSOD GZUNG BAR MI BYA STE, NYAMS PAR GYUR TE RE, ZHES RANG LA MI SNANG BA TZAM GYIS GZHAN LA YON TAN DE LTA BU MED CES 'CHAD MI RIGS PA'I DON STON PA LA, RNAM 'GREL LAS, TSAD MA RNAMS NI MI 'JUG PA, MED LA MI 'JUG 'BRAS BU CAN, ZHES SOGS KYIS BSTAN,
There is a sutra where it says,
No person should ever judge another; those who try will fall.
The point of these words is to show us how wrong it is for us to say that
someone else lacks any particular good quality, only because it does not appear
to us that they do. This same point is made in the Commentary with lines such
as the following:

In a case where valid perception has yet
To engage in the object, the result obtained
Is that they don't: they didn't engage.
***************
The full story behind this quotation is not often told in traditional Tibetan
monasteries. It appears as an important section of the Greater Compendium of All
the Sutras (Mahstrasamuccaya, mDo kun las btus-pa chen-po), compiled by
Lord Atisha (982-1052), and is translated here in full:

,DE BZHIN GSHEGS PA DE YONGS SU MYA NGAN LAS 'DAS NAS LO STONG DU DAM PA'I CHOS GNAS PAR GYUR TE, DE PHYIN CHAD SGRA DE DAG KYANG SHING DE DAG LAS 'BYUNG BA MED PAR GYUR TO,
[Lord Buddha is speaking to his disciples, and describing a Buddha who had
come before him:]
"The holy Dharma survived in the world for a thousand years after this
Buddha, the One Gone Thus, had passed into his final nirvana. After that,
those special sounds that came from the trees and spoke the Dharma to people
disappeared as well.

"Listen, o child of noble family. That Buddha--the One Gone Thus, the
Destroyer of the Foe, the Totally Enlightened One whose name was 'Towering
like the Mountain at the Center of the World'--passed into his final nirvana
only after he had appointed a certain monk, a teacher of the Dharma by the
name of 'Pure Life,' to protect the teachings in this world.

"In those days there came another monk, one whose name was 'Intellect of
Action.' He was possessed of a veritable mountain of morality, and had as
well attained the five different kinds of worldly clairvoyance. He was
moreover well versed in the scriptural collection concerning the subject of
vowed morality.

"This monk lived with a group of followers who were the highest masters of
an ascetic way of life, and who had found joy in living with nothing but the
worst of food and lodging. They all built themselves an abbey in which to
stay, and there Intellect succeeded in bringing his followers to a very high and
pure level of moral living. They came to have a deep love for the way of
vows, for the way of life that leads of purification.

"This monk, Intellect, spent his days making great efforts in the spiritual life,
and in his heart he kept to the Wish for enlightenment. He was continually
urging all the other aspiring bodhisattvas to live this way of life as well, and
to keep up a worldview, a way of looking at things, which was pure and
correct.

states that all things with causes are impermanent. He succeeded in bringing
them to believe that all things with causes are suffering. He succeeded in
bringing them to believe that nothing with a cause has any nature of its own.
He became a great master of single-pointed meditation. He became a great
master of the deeds of a bodhisattva, and he came to possess a great store of
good karma within him.

the way of life which leads to purification: they became well versed in the

acting in unexpected ways to help others.

came with his followers to the abbey where the monk Intellect was staying.
They took up residence there. Pure Life, out of compassion for those living in

the people. Then he would return home to the abbey. There in the homes of

to lose his faith in those other bodhisattvas. He began to talk about how they
were always going into the towns, and finally ordered that the gandi stick be
beaten, to announce an assembly of the community of monks. When they had
all come together, he gave the following order:

behaving carelessly. And what need is there anyway for those who are
supposed to speak little to go to town? Staying in the monastery is an activity
which Lord Buddha has clearly allowed us, and which He has recommended
for our way of life.

Formal logic subject:
The definition of a reason

DANG PO LA, RTAGS SU BKOD PA, RTAGS KYI MTSAN NYID, DE SGRUB KYI RTAGS SU BKOD 
PA, DE SGRUB KYI RTAGS KYI MTSAN NYID,
Here is the first part of our discussion. The definition of a reason is "Anything
put forth as a reason." The definition of a reason in any particular logical
statement is, "Anything put forth as the reason in any particular logical
statement."

YOD MED GANG RUNG YIN NA, DE SGRUB KYI RTAGS YIN PAS KHYAB STE, DE YIN NA, DE SGRUB KYI RTAGS SU BKOD PAS KHYAB PA'I PHYIR TE, RI BONG RVA DE, DE CHOS CAN, MI RTAG STE, RI BONG RVA YIN PA'I PHYIR ZHES PA'I RTAGS SU BKOD PA'I PHYIR,
It doesn't even matter if something exists or not, it can always be a reason in
any particular logical statement. This is because of the fact that, no matter
what something may be, it can still always be put forth as the reason in any
particular logical statement. And this is true because even the horns of a rabbit
can be put forth as a reason, in the following way:
Consider anything, whether it exists or not.
It is a changing thing,
Because it is the horns of a rabbit.

The definition of the reason in a logical statement to prove that sound is a
changing thing is, "Anything put forth as the reason in a logical statement to
prove that sound is changing." The definition of the reason in a logical
statement where a thing which is made is used as a reason in a logical
statement to prove that sound is changing is, "Anything put forth as the reason
in a logical statement where a thing which is made is used as a reason in a
logical statement to prove that sound is changing." This same pattern applies
to all other cases as well.
***************

The forms of debate:
The motivation for debating,
and how to begin a debate
Monks in a monastery such as Sera Mey Tibetan Monastery in south India
follow a rigorous schedule of debate. At around age twelve, young monks
begin to study formal logic (takrik) and the basic related topics (dura) with their
house teacher. By age fifteen, if their progress is satisfactory, they are allowed
to enter the debate courtyard and participate in the debates.
At Sera Mey, debates are held twice a day on every other day, once in the
morning and once at night. On the remaining days, with the exception of
Tuesday (which is market day), debating is held only at night, so that monks
can attend extra classes with their scripture teachers in the morning.
Debate is an incredibly powerful tool for reviewing and digging deeper into
the subjects learned during classes each day. During a typical day, a monk
will spend the early morning in prayers at the assembly hall, and then go
home to memorize scripture in his room. Later in the morning he attends
either debate or his regular classes. This is followed by a break for lunch, a
rest, and personal study. The afternoon is spent in two or three classes with
five to twenty other students, in the room of a scripture master.
After an evening meal, monks study on their own. Around six o'clock, a gong
called a ka-nga (sky-drum) is beat from atop the main temple of the monastery.
This is the call to the debate courtyard. The beat begins slow, and then speeds
up to a quick pulse. By the time it reaches its crescendo, all monks are
expected to be ready in the courtyard, sitting in rows around the platform and
throne (called a shuktri) where the great debates are centered.
No books are allowed in the debate courtyard; the feeling as you sit in your
room and hear the gong beaten is that you will be completely naked, and
armed only with your own knowledge. You straighten your robes, grab your
monk's shawl and your rosary, and slip a small Tibetan rug under your arm.
This carpet will keep your bottom warm through the many hours ahead,
exposed to the night, sitting on the flagstones of the courtyard. Until recently,
the debate courtyards in south India had no electricity; it still fails frequently,
and some of the most pleasant hours of a monk's day are spent out on the
courtyard, under the stars, in the sound of the debates and a soft wind blowing
past.
The debate master, known as the giku, supervises the debates, walking around
the courtyard answering questions, urging the debaters on, and enforcing
discipline with an occasional hearty swing of his rosary. He is normally a

senior geshe, and serves as vice-abbot of the entire monastery, representing the
abbot whenever he is unable to attend a function.
A senior student in the debate courtyard, one with a good voice and memory,
begins to recite the kurim (sku-rim), or opening prayers. No debate session is
begun without at least a brief version of the opening prayers. This is a time
for every monk to sit quietly, chanting and reviewing his motivation for the
debates. It is considered extremely important to think carefully during these
prayers, and to remove any emotions of competitiveness or pride for the
coming debates. We debate so that we can help the others around us, and to
examine what we believe, so that we can become enlightened more quickly,
and therefore be of ultimate help to all living beings.
Once a week, an extensive evening kurim is held. The entire nighttime
debating session is devoted to prayers for the benefit of beings, for everyone's
successful practice of the Dharma, for proper motivation, and to prevent
obstacles. Here is a list of the prayers that are currently recited in the
extensive kurim; a few of the items have changed from the days in Tibet:
1) The Extensive Verses on Going for Refuge and Thinking about the
Wish for Enlightenment

SKYABS 'GRO SEMS BSKYED RGYAS PA,
2) The Thousand Angels of the Heaven of Bliss (Ganden Hlagyama)

DGA' LDAN LHA BRGYA MA,
3) Three repetitions of the Lady of Liberation (Drolma, or Tara) from Potala

PO TA LA YI SGROL MA,
4) Reverence to the Goddess, a Praise of the Lady of Liberation

LHA MO LA GUS,
5) The Twenty-One for the Holy and Realized Being, the Lady of Liberation;
twenty-one verses of praise to the twenty-one forms of Tara,
consisting of twenty-one prostrations and recited twenty-one
times

SGROL MA NYER 
6) The Prayer of the Holy and Conquering Angel, Verses in Praise of the Lady
of Liberation; this is sometimes alternated with another praise of
Tara, The Glorious Queen of the Divine

GCIGRJE BTZUN BCOM LDAN MA,
LEGS BRIS DPAL MA,
7) The Prayer of the Angel of the White Parasol (Dukkar, or Sita Tapatra)

GDUGS DKAR,
8) The Seventy Million Victors, in Praise of the Angel of the White Parasol

RGYAL BA BYE BA,
9) Three repetitions of the Essence of Wisdom ("Heart Sutra") --this can
be done either in a very quick version, or in a very slow version
to a beautiful tune; on special occasions, 17 of the quicker version
and one of the slow are done

SHES RAB SNYING PO,
10) The Prayer of the Angel with the Face of a Lion (Senggey Dongchen,
Simha Mukhi), for Preventing Every Obstacle

SENG GDONG MA,
11) The Tree of Sandalwood, a Prayer to the Wishing Jewel, the White
Protector (Gunkar Yishin Norbu, Sita Chintamani Mahakala)

TZAN DAN LJON SHING ,
12) The Servant of Gentle Voice (Manjushri)

'JAM DPAL BKA' NYAN,
13) The Powerful One from the Burial Ground of Maru, a Prayer to the
Protector Known as Chamsing; Chamsing is an early major
protector for Sera Mey Monastery, and is shared with other
monasteries

DBANG LDAN MA RU,
Please note! The protectors mentioned here have nothing to do
with the object of the current protector controversy.
14) The Palace Built of Bliss, a Prayer to the Protector Known as Taok; Taok
is a unique protector who watches over Sera Mey, and who
appeared after Chamsing

RANG BZHIN BDE BA,
15) The Blaze of the Teachings, a Prayer that the Teachings of the Buddha
Remain Strong in our World

BSTAN 'BAR MA,
16) A variety of different verses of auspiciousness

BKRA SHIS TSIG BCAD,
On other days, a different kurim is done in the morning and the evening. The
following is a typical morning kurim:
1) Three repetitions of the Essence of Wisdom ("Heart Sutra")

SHES RAB SNYING PO,
2) A Supplication to the Lamas of the Lineage of the Debate Tradition, which
is "updated" by the great lamas of subsequent generations to
include the great figures of the Sera Mey debate tradition; when
His Holiness the Dalai Lama appointed our root Lama, Khen
Rinpoche Geshe Lobsang Tharchin, to be abbot of Sera Mey, he
told Rinpoche: "Oh, I really wanted to get your name into the
lineage!"

CHOS GRVA BLA BRGYUD,
The kurim in the evening of the same day would be as follows:
1) A Supplication to an Eminent Lama of the Debate Tradition of Sera Mey,
Kedrup Tenpa Dargye

MKHAS GRUB BSTAN PA DAR RGYAS LA GSOL 'DEBS,
2) Chanting the Names of Gentle Voice (Manjushri)

'JAM DPAL MTSAN BRJOD,
3) Chanting the Longer Incantation of the Woman of Total Victory
(Namgyalma, or Vijayi); this prayer is used for both protection and
for a long and healthy life

RNAM RGYAL MA'I GZUNGS RING ,
4) A single recitation of the Essence of Wisdom ("Heart Sutra")
After the kurim is completed, the monks break out in a kind of victory cheer
using the sound dhi!--the root syllable of Gentle Voice, the embodiment of the
Buddha's intellect and wisdom--to celebrate the beginning of another debate
session. Each monk then stands up and mills around the debate courtyard,
looking for another monk with whom to debate one-on-one. This is an
opportunity for monks from different classes (like freshmen and sophomores
in high school) to challenge each other.
Since each class is debating a completely different subject, this is an excellent
time for the older monks to review what they have already learned, by
choosing a partner from one of the lower classes. The younger monk, in turn,
has a chance either to go through his class's current topic with a more
experienced debater, or to hear a little bit about a topic which he will have to
debate in the coming years.
The two monks decide on who will be the attacker, and who the defender.
The defender throws his carpet down on the flagstones, often near a wall
where he can lean, and seats himself. The attacker stands facing his opponent,
thinking furiously of a subject from which to begin. He then unfolds part of
his monk's shawl and drapes it over his left shoulder from the back, a sign of
respect that has been followed since the time of Lord Buddha.
The attacker bows close to his opponent's face and claps his hands,
simultaneously whispering, Dhi jitar chuchen!--which means: "Dhi! So what
do you think about this one?" He begins the debate then normally by making
a statement which is false, to see if his opponent can disprove him. A typical
statement of this kind might be, "There is no logical reason why Lord Buddha
repeated himself in the Heart Sutra, where he says 'Well done! Well done!"

This naturally becomes the starting point of a heated argument, which might
last for hours.
The attacker in the debate will accompany his salvos with vigorous body
language like stamping and clapping, as well as shouts and taunts. None of
this is meant in a competitive or insulting way, but only as a way of breaking
the concentration of the opponent. Monks trained in the debate courtyard
thereby learn to concentrate deeply, and to stay free of distraction even with
hundreds of screaming debaters all around them. This will be a great asset to
them when they must sit in their rooms and think out difficult texts, or as they
answer future students in different parts of the world, as they present their
objections or difficult questions on specific points in the Buddha's teachings.
After about an hour or so, the debate master walks through the midst of the
debaters, waving the end of his monk's shawl. This is a sign for the various
classes to group together for the second stage of the debates; all the monks
studying Middle-Way philosophy, for example, move quickly (for fear of the
debate master's rosary) to sit together in a particular corner of the debate
ground.
Here the monks of each class sit in two groups facing each other, with a
narrow corridor left between the two groups. The groups themselves form into
rows, perhaps three or four deep in a larger class, so that every monk can
watch the debate. Each class has a class leader, known as a kyorpon (or
"recitation leader"), who is chosen in the first year that the class is formed, and
who will serve in his position until the members of the class take their geshe
examinations some 18 years later.
Each member of the class throws his rosary into a pile on the flagstones in the
open space between the two groups of monks. The class leader picks all the
rosaries up in his hands, and tosses the whole bunch into the air. He closes
his eyes and grabs one of the rosaries as the bunch falls to the ground. The
owner of this rosary will be the defender in the first debate of the session.
This process is repeated for the attacker, and usually for an "assistant"
defender. Monks who enjoy debate bring huge, long rosaries to the courtyard,
and the lazy ones buy a tiny one.
The two defenders seat themselves on their mats at the head of the corridor
between the two groups of monks, and the attacker comes and stands within
the corridor. He begins a debate as before. After a few minutes, any monk
who has a good idea to bring up might start to yell it at the defenders as well,
and will often stand up and push his way past the original attacker. Within
about a half an hour, a whole group of attackers may be pushing and shoving
to get to the front and scream their question at the defenders. This part can

be very physical, but it is extremely rare to see anyone in the debate courtyard
actually lose their temper.
The tempo of a debate is very fast, with heavy philosophical concepts flying
by in a clipped mixture of modern slang and ancient literary Tibetan. The
audience has to listen carefully to follow where the debaters are running. It
takes only a few minutes to tear through a difficult concept in a way so
thorough that it could never be accomplished even in hours of classroom time
or reading in one's room. There is probably no more powerful tool for
learning the great ideas of Buddhism.
Selecting a topic, and maintaining a good motivation, are the two keys in
getting the most out of the wonderful opportunity of a debate. An experienced
debater, like any good Buddhist, learns to bring up the difficult points that he
or she is unsure of--it is less comfortable than debating what you already
understand clearly, but within a few minutes you will have deep insights into
your question that you could never come up with on your own. Most
nighttime debates last for four or five hours, and it is not unusual for a class
to get engrossed and go on for most of the night. The level of understanding
which monks reach this way is extraordinary.
It is important to give up any feeling of being self-conscious or embarrassed
about debating. Say what you think, and say it with power! If you're wrong,
you'll learn something new, and you can only be the better for it. Remember
that your whole motivation is to become enlightened as quickly as you can,
and be able to lead others to the paradise of enlightenment too. For this you
will have to know your stuff well--you will have to know what you believe,
and know why you believe it, and be able to express it clearly and defend it,
especially in a country where Buddhism is just beginning.
It is essential for American Buddhists to believe in the Dharma only when it
makes perfect sense to them, and not because of blind faith or tradition. Only
then will the Dharma take strong root in this country, and only then will
millions be able to follow it, and reach the goal of deathless bliss. You will
have no trouble debating if you remember this--you are debating to save the
lives of others.

An Outline of All Existing Things
The selection here is from the monastic textbook entitled An Explanation of the
Science of Logic, included in the Advanced Path of Reasoning, a Section from
the "Key to the Logic Machine," a Presentation of the Collected Topics which

Purbuchok Jampa Tsultrim Gyatso (1825-1901), who in his day held the position of
Tutor to the Dalai Lama.

Here is the second section, an outline of existence. Here we will refute the

their rebuttal.
_______________

DANG PO LA, KHA CIG NA RE, GZHI GRUB NA, RTAG PA YIN PAS KHYAB ZER NA,
Here is the first. Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
If a thing can be established as existing, then it is necessarily an
unchanging thing.

BUM PA CHOS CAN, RTAG PA YIN PAR THAL, GZHI GRUB PA'I PHYIR, KHYAB PA KHAS,
Consider then a water pitcher.
So is it an unchanging thing?
Because it can be established as existing.
[It doesn't necessarily follow.]
But you already agreed that it does necessarily follow.

MA GRUB NA, DE CHOS CAN, DER THAL, TSAD MAS GRUB PA YIN PA'I PHYIR, KHYAB STE, TSAD MAS GRUB PA, GZHI GRUB KYI MTSAN NYID YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[It's not correct to say a water pitcher can be established as existing.]
Suppose you say that it's not correct [to say that a water pitcher can be
established as existing.]
It is so [something that can be established as existing],

[It doesn't necessarily follow.]
But it does necessarily follow, because "anything which can be perceived
directly by direct, valid perception" is the definition of a thing which belongs
to obvious reality.

[Your point above is not correct: it's not correct to say that a pillar is a
thing which can be perceived directly by direct, valid perception.]
Suppose you say that our point above is not correct; [suppose you say that a
pillar is not a thing which can be perceived directly by direct, valid
perception].
Consider this same thing.
It is so [a thing which can be perceived directly by direct, valid perception],
Because it is a working thing.

[Then I agree with your original statement: a pillar is something that
could never belong to hidden reality.]

Suppose you agree with our original statement.
Consider this same thing.
It is so something which can belong to hidden reality,
Because it is something which can be perceived by a conceptual state of mind
as something which is hidden.
The reason has already been proven.

GNYIS PA RANG GI LUGS LA, GZHI GRUB KYI MTSAN NYID YOD DE, TSAD MAS GRUB PA DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Here is the second major part, where we present our own position.
There does exist a definition for "that which can be established as existing,"
Because "that which can be established by a valid perception" is the definition.
 GZHI GRUB LA DBYE NA GNYIS YOD DE, RTAG PA DANG , DNGOS PO GNYIS YOD PA'I PHYIR,
There do exist two different categories for "that which can be established as

 RTAG PA'I MTSAN NYID YOD DE, CHOS DANG SKAD CIG MA MA YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN PA DE, RTAG PA'I MTSAN NYID YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There does exist a definition for "unchanging thing,"
Because "one object which is both a thing and which is not such that it only
lasts for a moment" is the definition of an "unchanging thing."

RTAG PA LA DBYE NA GNYIS YOD DE, YIN PA SRID PA'I RTAG PA DANG , YIN PA MI SRID PA'I RTAG PA GNYIS YOD PA'I PHYIR,
Things which are unchanging can be divided into two different types:

SRID PA'I RTAG PA BZHAG TU YOD DE, RTAG DNGOS GNYIS DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There does exist something which is an unchanging thing that can be,
Because "knowable things" is it.
There does exist something which is an unchanging thing that cannot be,
Because "the two of unchanging things and changing things" is it.

DNGOS PO'I MTSAN NYID YOD DE, DON BYED NUS PA DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,

Because "anything which performs a function" is the definition.

There exist three different kinds of working things, for there are the three of

BEM PO'I MTSAN NYID YOD DE, RDUL DU GRUB PA DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There does exist a definition for "matter,"
Because "something made of tiny physical particles" is the definition.

BEM PO LA DBYE NA GNYIS YOD DE, PHYI'I BEM PO DANG , NANG GI BEM PO GNYIS YOD PA'I PHYIR,

There does exist a definition for "outer physical matter," for "something which

of a being" is the definition.

MTSAN GZHI YOD DE, BUM PA, KA BA, SA CHU ME RLUNG BZHI PO DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There do exist classical examples of outer physical matter, for a water pitcher,
a pillar, and the four elements of earth, water, fire, and wind are just such
examples.

There does exist a classical example of inner physical matter, for the impure

SHES PA'I MTSAN NYID YOD DE, GSAL ZHING RIG PA DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There does exist a definition for "something mental," because "anything which
is both invisible and aware" is the definition.

MTSAN GZHI YOD DE, MIG SHES DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There does exist a classical example of something mental, because visual
consciousness is just such an example.

LDAN MIN 'DU BYED KYI MTSAN NYID YOD DE, BEM SHES GANG RUNG MA YIN PA'I 'DUS BYAS DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There does exist a definition for an "active thing which is neither matter nor

definition.

MTSAN GZHI YOD DE, DNGOS PO DANG , MI RTAG PA DANG , RTA DANG BA GLANG SOGS GANG ZAG RNAMS DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There do exist classical examples of active things which are neither matter nor

horses or cattle are just such examples.

YANG GZHI GRUB LA DBYE NA, GNYIS YOD DE, GCIG DANG THA DAD GNYIS YOD PA'I PHYIR,
There does exist another way of dividing up those things which can be

two of being either one thing or separate things.

GCIG GI MTSAN NYID YOD DE, SO SO BA MA YIN PA'I CHOS DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There does exist a definition of "being one thing," because "being a thing which
is not individual things" is the definition.

MTSAN GZHI YOD DE, SHES BYA, RTAG PA, DNGOS PO RNAMS RE RE NAS DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There do exist classical examples of being one, because there are the examples
of "all knowable things," "all unchanging things," and "all working

THA DAD KYI MTSAN NYID YOD DE, SO SO BA'I CHOS DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There does exist a definition for "being separate things," because "being

MTSAN GZHI YOD DE, RTAG DNGOS GNYIS, MTSAN MTSON GNYIS, KA BUM GNYIS, GSER BUM DANG ZANGS BUM GNYIS RNAMS DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There do exist classical examples of things that are separate things, because
there are "the two of unchanging things and changing things," and "the two of

 YANG SHES BYA LA DBYE NA GNYIS SU YOD DE, RANG MTSAN DANG SPYI MTSAN GNYIS YOD PA'I PHYIR,
There does exist another way of dividing up knowable things, because they can

RANG MTSAN GYI MTSAN NYID YOD DE, SGRA RTOG GIS BTAGS TZAM MA YIN PAR RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYI GRUB PA'I CHOS DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There does exist a definition for a "thing which exists in and of itself," because
a "thing which exists of its own accord, and which is not just something made
up with a name or an idea" is the definition.

SPYI MTSAN GYI MTSAN NYID YOD DE, SGRA RTOG GIS BTAGS PA TZAM YIN GYI RANG MTSAN DU MA GRUB PA DE, SPYI MTSAN GYI MTSAN NYID YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There does exist a definition for a "conceptualization," because "anything which

DE BZHIN DU DON DAM PAR DON BYED NUS PA'I CHOS, DON DAM BDEN PA'I MTSAN NYID,
Just so, the definition of a "thing which is ultimately real" is "anything which
is, ultimately, able to perform a function."

DON DAM PAR DON BYED MI NUS PA'I CHOS, KUN RDZOB BDEN PA'I MTSAN NYID YIN NO,
The definition of a "thing which is deceptively real" is "any thing which is,

Here is the third major part, where we disprove any rebuttal.
Suppose someone comes and claims,

It isn't so, that "anything which can be an object of the mind" is the
definition of a "knowable thing,"
Because "anything which can be the object of a mind that can be" is not
the definition of a "knowable thing that can be."

But it doesn't necessarily follow,
Because if something can be established as existing, it is always both (1)
something which can be the object of a mind that can be; and (2)
something which can be the object of a mind that cannot be.
And this is true because anything which can be established as existing is
always something which can be apprehended by both that omniscience
which is, and by that omniscience which is not.

YANG KHO NA RE, MI RTAG PA DANG , RTAG PA'I GZHI MTHUN YOD PAR THAL, SGRA MI RTAG PA DANG , RTAG PA GNYIS KA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Suppose another person comes, and makes another claim:

Because sound is both changing and unchanging.

[It's not correct to say that sounds are both changing and unchanging.]
It is so, [that sounds are both changing and unchanging],
Because what you call "sound" is something which is both (1) changing

At this point you should use the following answer: "Your combined reason is

YANG KHA CIG 'DUS MA BYAS KYI NAM MKHA' CHOS CAN, DON DAM BDEN PA YIN PAR THAL, MNGON SUM GYI SNANG NGOR GRUB PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Someone may come and make the following claim:

Because it can be established as existing to the state of mind of direct,
valid perception.

MA GRUB NA, DE CHOS CAN, DER THAL, MNGON SUM GYI SNANG NGOR YOD PA'I PHYIR,
[It's not correct to say that it can be established as existing to the state of mind

Because it's something that is apprehended by direct, valid perception;
And this is true because it is something apprehended by omniscience.
 GONG DU 'DOD NA, DE CHOS CAN, DON DAM BDEN PA MA YIN PAR THAL, KUN RDZOB BDEN PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
And suppose you say that our point above is correct.
Consider this same thing.
It isn't so, that empty space belongs to ultimate reality,
Because it belongs to deceptive reality.

MA GRUB NA, DE CHOS CAN, DER THAL, RTAG PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[It's not correct to say that empty space belongs to deceptive reality.]
Suppose you say that it's not correct [to say that empty space belongs

Because it is unchanging.
***************
Formal logic subject:
The subject, the quality to be proven,
and the quality denied in a logical statement

,GNYIS PA DBYE BA BSHAD PA LA, RTAGS YANG DAG BSHAD PA, DE'I LDOG PHYOGS RTAGS LTAR SNANG BSHAD PA GNYIS, DANG PO LA, RTAGS YANG DAG GI LTOS GZHI DANG , MTSAN NYID, DBYE BA BSHAD PA DANG GSUM,
Here is the second part, which is an explanation of the different kinds of
reasons. Here there are two divisions: an explanation of correct reasons, and
an explanation of the opposite; that is, incorrect reasons. The first comes in
three steps of its own--explanations of the pivotal objects for a correct reason;
of the definition of a correct reason; and of the different types of correct
reasons.

DANG PO LA, PHYOGS CHOS KYI LTOS GZHI SHES 'DOD CHOS CAN BSHAD PA DANG , KHYAB PA'I LTOS GZHI MTHUN PHYOGS DANG MI MTHUN PHYOGS BSHAD PA GNYIS,
The first of these has two further sections: an explanation of the subject (the
basis of the opponent's doubt)--which is the pivotal object in the relationship
between the subject and the reason; and an explanation of the pivotal object in
the necessary relationships between the quality to be proven and the
reason--that is, the groups of similar cases and dissimilar cases.

DANG PO LA, SHES 'DOD CHOS CAN GYI MTSAN NYID, MTSAN GZHI, ZHAR LA BSGRUB BYA'I CHOS NGOS BZUNG BA DANG GSUM,
We will present the first of these in three parts: the definition of the subject, a
classical example of a subject, and then--as an incidental point--identifying the
quality to be proven.

DANG PO LA, KHYOD BYAS PA'I RTAGS KYIS SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I RTZOD GZHIR BZUNG BA YANG YIN, KHYOD BYAS PAR TSAD MAS NGES NAS, KHYOD MI RTAG PA YIN MIN LA SHES 'DOD ZHUGS PA'I GANG ZAG SRID PA YANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN PAR DMIGS PA, KHYOD BYAS PA'I RTAGS KYIS SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I SHES 'DOD CHOS CAN SKYON MED YIN PA'I MTSAN NYID,
Here is the first. The following is the definition of a "flawless subject in a
proof where being made is used as a reason to prove that sounds are changing
things":
It must exist as one object which combines both of the following
qualities:

It must first of all be something which is considered the basis of
contention in a proof where being made is used as a reason to
prove that sounds are changing things.
There must also be possible a person who, once they have
ascertained that it is something which is made, still entertains
doubts about whether it is unchanging or not.

GNYIS PA MTSAN GZHI NI, SGRA DE DE YIN, DE 'DRA'I SHES 'DOD CHOS CAN DE YIN NA SGRA DANG GCIG YIN PAS KHYAB BO, ,
Here secondly is the classical example; and this "sounds." Anything which is
this particular subject in a logical statement is necessarily one and the same as
sounds themselves.

GSUM PA NI, BSGRUB BYA'I CHOS SU BZUNG BA, BSGRUB BYA'I CHOS KYI MTSAN NYID,
The third part here will have two parts of its own: identifying the quality to
be proven, and the definition of the quality to be proven.

BDAG MED YIN NA, BSGRUB BYA'I CHOS YIN PAS KHYAB STE, BDAG MED YIN NA, KHYOD SGRA KHYOD DU SGRUB PA'I BSGRUB BYA'I CHOS YIN PAS KHYAB PA'I PHYIR, DES NA BSGRUB BYA'I CHOS YIN NA, CHOS YIN PAS MA KHYAB BO, ,
If something lacks a self-nature, then it can always be the quality to be proven.
This is because--if something lacks a self-nature--it can always be the quality
to be proven in a logical statement where you are trying to prove that sounds
are it. Therefore we can say that, if something is a quality to be proven, it
need not be an existing thing.

SGRA MI RTAG PAR BSGRUB PA'I BSGRUB BYA'I CHOS SU BZUNG BA, SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I BSGRUB BYA'I CHOS KYI MTSAN NYID,
Here is the definition of a quality to be proven in a logical proof that sounds
are changing things: "Anything which can be considered the quality to be
proven in a logical proof that sounds are changing things."

DE LA DBYE NA, DE SGRUB KYI DNGOS KYI BSGRUB BYA'I CHOS DANG , DE SGRUB KYI SHUGS KYI BSGRUB BYA'I CHOS GNYIS,
Qualities to be proven can be divided into two separate types: qualities to be
proven which are explicit, and qualities to be proven which are implicit.

MTSAN NYID RIM PA BZHIN, DE SGRUB KYI DNGOS KYI BSGRUB BYA'I CHOS SU BZUNG BA, DE SGRUB KYI DNGOS KYI BSGRUB BYA'I CHOS KYI MTSAN NYID,
Here are their respective definitions. "Anything which can be considered the
explicit quality to be proven in a logical statement" is the definition of an
"explicit quality to be proven in any particular logical statement."

DE SGRUB KYI SHUGS KYI BSGRUB BYA'I CHOS SU BZUNG BA, DE SGRUB KYI SHUGS KYI BSGRUB BYA'I CHOS KYI MTSAN NYID,
"Anything which can be considered the implicit quality to be proven in a
logical statement" is the definition of an "implicit quality to be proven in any
particular logical statement."

MTSAN GZHI RIM PA BZHIN, MI RTAG PA DANG PO DANG , MI RTAG PA MA YIN PA LAS LOG PA GNYIS PA YIN,
Classical examples for these two, respectively, would be the following. An
example of the first would be "a changing thing." An example of the second
would be "the opposite of all that is not a changing thing."

YANG MI RTAG PA DANG SKAD CIG MA GNYIS RE RE NAS BYAS PA'I RTAGS KYI DE SGRUB KYI DNGOS KYI BSGRUB BYA'I CHOS DANG , DE GNYIS MA YIN PA LAS LOG PA GNYIS RE RE NAS DE SGRUB KYI SHUGS KYI BSGRUB BYA'I CHOS YIN NO, ,
You could also say that both "a changing thing" and "something that lasts only
a moment" are, each of them, explicit qualities to be proven in a logical proof
where being made is used as a reason to make the proof. The two

opposites--of all that each one of them is not--would then each be an example
of implicit qualities to be proven.

SGRA CHOS CAN, MI RTAG STE, BYAS PA'I PHYIR, ZHES BKOD PA'I TSE, SGRA SBYOR BA DE SGRUB KYI RTZOD GZHI, MI RTAG PA DE SGRUB KYI BSGRUB BYA'I CHOS, SGRA MI RTAG PA BSGRUB BYA, BYAS PA RTAGS YANG DAG, RTAG PA DGAG BYA'I CHOS, SGRA RTAG PA SBYOR BA DE SGRUB KYI DGAG BYAR 'JOG, DES GZHAN LA YANG RIGS 'GRE,
Let's consider now a case where we put forth the following logical statement:
Consider sounds.
They are changing things,
Because they are something which is made.
The basis of contention in this statement [--that is, the subject of the proof--]
is "sounds." The quality to be proven is being a changing thing. The assertion,
the idea to be proven, is that sounds are changing things. The reason is being
something which is made. The quality being denied is being an unchanging
thing. The idea being denied is that sounds are unchanging. You can apply
this same pattern to every other logical statement.

,SGRUB BYED NI, MI RTAG PA CHOS CAN, KHYOD SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I DNGOS KYI BSGRUB BYA'I CHOS YIN TE, MTSAN NYID DE'I PHYIR RO, ,
Here are logical statements to prove what we've said:
Consider "being a changing thing."
It is the explicit quality to be proven in a proof that sounds are
changing things,
Because it fits the definition given above.

SKAD CIG MA CHOS CAN, SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I DNGOS KYI BSGRUB BYA'I CHOS MA YIN TE, DE SGRUB KYI RTAGS YANG DAG YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Consider "being a thing that only lasts a moment."
It is not an explicit quality to be proven in a [certain] proof that sounds
are changing things,
Because [in a certain proof] that sounds are unchanging things it
provides the reason in the proof.
***************
The forms of debate:
Posture, the use of a rosary,
and formulating the statement of a reason in three parts
In our second lesson we will cover the classical posture for debating, how to
use a rosary during a debate, and how to formulate a classical logical statement
during a debate.
The person defending in a debate sits down and faces the challenger, who
stands. The defender normally maintains a fairly mild appearance (until the
debate gets hot), gesturing slightly with his hands, and answering quickly and
concisely to points raised by the challenger.
The challenger, on the other hand, uses extensive body language to throw his
opponent off. After the initial challenge, he stands sideways to his opponent,
with his left foot forward. Each new assertion is accompanied by a stamp of
the left foot, and a clap of the right hand on top of the left, where the rosary
is strung around the arm. From time to time, the rosary is stretched back with
the right hand as if aiming an arrow from a bow. This is an ancient debating
custom, and in pictures of Master Dignaga or Master Dharmakirti we can still
see the same gesture.
The rosary, as noted earlier, is also used in the selection of the initial challenger
and defender. It is also an important tool for counting out lists of things,
which are so popular in Buddhism: the two realities, the three Jewels, the four
arya truths, the five paths, the six realms. . .and so on. During the course of
a debate, the challenger and defender will often count out a list together on
their rosaries, to make sure both are in synch on the point. Very occasionally
a debater will swing a rosary to make a point, although it is rare and
unaccepted to actually strike the other party--it would be more common to
strike your own thigh or palm to get a nice "thwock"!
Positioning in front of the opponent says a lot. When an opponent makes a
very serious mistake or uses circular reasoning, you might swirl around in a
spin and come down with a clap. If an opponent takes too long to answer a

question or remember a quotation, you might turn your back and walk away
a few strides, to feign disgust with his lack of preparation. Sometimes you
might make rhetorical comments to the audience on both sides--"Where did
he get that statement from? Sounds like a quotation from an autocommentary
to a root text that was never written!"--and throw out your arms with your
palms up, like "Who could ever debate with such a dummy!"
Sometimes you would get a bunch of your classmates up beside you to scream
the same syllogism a few times in unison, with exactly the same claps and
stamps: it looks like a chorus line or cheerleaders yelling Buddhist logic.
Again, the whole point is that everyone learn to think quickly and clearly
under pressure, which will help us all spread the teachings. The debates in
Tibetan monasteries are refreshingly free of any of the American competitive
attitude, and everybody is just excited about learning. In 15 years of debating
in Tibetan monasteries, the American monk writing this account has never
once been treated with any trace of disrespect or prejudice.
The classical presentation of a proposition in debate, after the initial challenge,
has three parts, following the rules of formal logic established even a early as
Lord Buddha himself. We first choose a subject, the thing we are going to
debate about. One example would be "human beings." Then we choose a
quality about them that we wish to prove to our opponent; for example, that
they "have to die." Finally we choose a reason--which in Buddhist logic more
often refers to the main thing mentioned in the reason as it is expressed--such
as "being born." The entire proposition presented to the opponent then will
look like this:

MI CHOS CAN,
Consider human beings.

SHI RGYU YIN TE,
They do have to die,

SKYES PA'I PHYIR,
Because they are born.
The defender listens to this proposition carefully, and then quickly prepares his
answer in his mind. The very specific rules for answering will be covered in
the reading for the next class.

own position, and then finally eliminate their rebuttal.

Here finally is the third part, eliminating any rebuttal concerning our position.
Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
Consider the two of a pillar and a water pitcher.
They are so something general,
Because they are generals in the sense of a collection of parts.
To this we answer, "It is not necessarily the case."
The reason though is correct, because they are units composed of molecules
containing the eight substances, [which are: the four elements of earth, water,
fire, and wind; and the four objects of visual form, smells, tastes, and touches].
 'DOD NA, DE CHOS CAN, SPYI MA YIN PAR THAL, KHYOD KYI BYE BRAG MED PA'I PHYIR,
[Then I agree to your statement: I agree that the two of a pillar and a
water pitcher are something general.]
Suppose you agree to our statement, [and agree that the two of a pillar and a
water pitcher are something general].
It is not so, that they are something general, a general quality,
Because there is nothing which is characteristic of them.

characteristic of a pillar and a water pitcher].
Consider these same things.
It is so true, [that there is nothing which is characteristic of a pillar and a water
pitcher],
Because they are a knowable object which is not.

It is so [correct to say that there is no quality of which that thing which is

Because (1) there exists no quality of which "knowable objects" is characteristic,
and (2) "knowable objects" and "that thing which is knowable objects"

Because all objects, whether they are unchanging things or working things, are
of its type.

Suppose someone returns and makes the following claim:

Because "not being" is characteristic of the quality

Suppose you agree to the statement, [and say that "knowable things" is a

It is not so, that "knowable things" is a quality of which "not being" is

Because if something were a quality of which something that was not a

anything at all.

Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:

So it must then be characteristic of something,
Because it is an existing object which is an example of a

[It's incorrect to say that it is an existing object which is an example of a

It is so an existing object which is an example of a

Because there does exist an existence which subsumes it.

   MA KHYAB STE, MTSAN NYID KYI ZUR DU RANG GI RIGS YOD PA ZHES SMOS PA LA DGOS PA YOD PA'I PHYIR,
Our answer is, "It doesn't necessary follow." And this is because there is a
very important point served by saying the words "an example" in the definition
of being characteristic of something.
***************
Formal logic subject:
Similar cases, dissimilar cases, and
"similar examples" in a logical statement

GNYIS PA KHYAB PA'I LTOS GZHI MTHUN PHYOGS DANG MI MTHUN PHYOGS GNYIS BSHAD PA LA, DNGOS BSHAD PA DANG , ZHAR LA MTHUN DPE DANG MI MTHUN DPE BSHAD PA GNYIS,
This brings us to the second section of our explanation of the pivotal objects:
an explanation of the pivotal object in the necessary relationships between the
quality to be proven and the reason--that is, the groups of similar cases and
dissimilar cases. We will proceed in two steps: the actual explanation, and an
incidental treatment of the similar example and the dissimilar example.

DANG PO LA, MTSAN NYID, DBYE BA, SGRA BSHAD 'JUG GI MU BZHI RTZI BA, MTHUN PHYOGS DANG MI MTHUN PHYOGS GNYIS DNGOS 'GAL YIN MIN LA DPYAD PA DANG BZHI,
The first of these comes in four parts of its own:
1) definitions;
2) divisions;
3) a calculation of the permutations based on whether the cases actually
fit their name; and
4) an analysis of whether the groups of similar cases and dissimilar
cases are directly contradictory or not.

DANG PO LA SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I BSGRUB TSUL DANG MTHUN PAR MI RTAG PAS MI STONG PA,
SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I MTHUN PHYOGS KYI MTSAN NYID, MI RTAG PA DANG DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS GNYIS YIN KHYAB MNYAM YIN,
Here is the first. The following is the definition of the group of similar cases
in a proof that sounds are changing things:
All those things which are not void of the quality of being
changing things, in keeping with the way in which sounds are
proven to be changing things in any particular logical statement.
"Changing things" and the group of similar cases in just such a proof are such
that to be one is always to automatically be the other.

DE SGRUB KYI BSGRUB TSUL DANG MI MTHUN PAR MI RTAG PAS STONG PA, DE SGRUB KYI MI MTHUN PHYOGS KYI MTSAN NYID, MI RTAG PA MA YIN PA DANG DE GNYIS YIN KHYAB MNYAM YIN,
The following is the definition of the group of dissimilar cases:
All those things which are void of the quality of being changing
things, in keeping with the way in which this proof is made in
the particular logical statement.
"All that is not a changing thing" and this same group are such that to be one
is always to be the other.

GNYIS PA DE LA DBYE NA, DE SGRUB KYI MED PA MI MTHUN PHYOGS, GZHAN PA MI MTHUN PHYOGS, 'GAL BA MI MTHUN PHYOGS DANG GSUM,
Here secondly are the divisions. The group of dissimilar cases can come in
three different types:
1) The group of dissimilar cases that are not existing things;
2) The group of dissimilar cases that are something else; and
3) The group of dissimilar cases that are directly contradictory.

RI BONG RVA DANG PO, , SHES BYA GNYIS PA, RTAG PA GSUM PA YIN,
An example of the first would be the horns on a rabbit's head. An example of
the second would be "knowable things." An example of the third would be
"unchanging things."

GSUM PA NI, DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS YIN NA, DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS KYI SGRA BSHAD DU YOD PAS KHYAB BAM ZHE NA,
Here is the third part. One may ask the following:
If something is part of a group of similar cases in any particular
proof, is it then necessarily part of such a group in such a way
that it fits the name of the group?

'DI LA MU GSUM STE, DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS YIN LA, DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS KYI SGRA BSHAD DU MED PA'I MU, GNYIS KA YIN PA'I MU, GNYIS KA MA YIN PA'I MU DANG GSUM,
Three of the permutations here hold. There do exist the following:
1) Something which is part of a group of similar cases in a particular
proof, but which is not part of this group in such a way that it
fits the name of the group;
2) Something which is both [part of a group of similar cases in a
particular proof and which is also part of this group in such a
way that it fits the name of the group]; and
3) Something which is neither [part of a group of similar cases nor part
of this group in such a way that it fits the name of the group].

'DUS MA BYAS KYI NAM MKHA' DE, SGRA RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I MTHUN PHYOGS YIN LA, DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS KYI SGRA BSHAD DU MED PA'I MU YIN,
"That unproduced thing which is empty space" is an example of the first
permutation: it is something which is part of a group of similar cases in a
proof that sounds are unchanging things, but it is not part of this group in
such a way that it fits the name of the group.

DE SGRUB PA NI, DE CHOS CAN, DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS YIN PAR THAL, RTAG PA YIN PA'I PHYIR, DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS KYI SGRA BSHAD DU MED DE, DE DANG SGRA GNYIS RTAG PAR CHOS MI MTHUN PA'I PHYIR,
Here is a proof that this is true:
Consider this same thing [unproduced, empty space].
It is a part of the group of similar cases in the proof mentioned,
Because it is an unchanging thing.
It is not part of this group in such a way that it fits the
name of the group,
Because it is not a thing which is similar to sounds in the sense
that they are both unchanging things.

GNYIS KA YIN PA'I MU NI, BUM PA DE SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I MTHUN PHYOGS DANG , DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS KYI SGRA BSHAD DU YOD PA'I MU GNYIS KA YIN,
Now for the second permutation: something which is both. A water pitcher
is both something which is part of the group of similar cases in a proof that
sound is changing, and also something which is part of this group in such a
way that it fits the name of the group.

DE SGRUB PA NI, BUM PA CHOS CAN, DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS YIN PAR THAL, MI RTAG PA YIN PA'I PHYIR, DE CHOS CAN, DE'I SGRA BSHAD DU YOD DE, KHYOD DANG SGRA GNYIS MI RTAG PAR CHOS MTHUN PA'I PHYIR TE, KHYOD KYANG MI RTAG PA YIN, SGRA YANG MI RTAG PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Here is a proof that this is true:
Consider a water pitcher.
It is so something which is part of the group of similar
cases of this same proof,
Because it is a changing thing.

Consider this same thing.
It is a part of this group in such a way that it fits the
name of the group,
Because it is a thing which is similar to sounds in the
sense that they are both changing things: a water
pitcher is a changing thing, and a sound is also a
changing thing.

GNYIS KA MA YIN PA'I MU NI, 'DUS MA BYAS KYI NAM MKHA' DE, SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I MTHUN PHYOGS MA YIN PA DANG , DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS KYI SGRA BSHAD DU MED PA'I MU GNYIS KA YIN,
Next is the permutation where something is neither. "The unproduced thing
called 'empty space'" is something which is neither part of the group of similar
cases in a proof that sound is a changing thing, nor a part of this group in such
a way that it fits the name of the group.

DE SGRUB PA NI, DE CHOS CAN, DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS MA YIN PAR THAL, MI RTAG PA MA YIN PA'I PHYIR, DE CHOS CAN, DE'I SGRA BSHAD DU MED DE, KHYOD DANG SGRA GNYIS MI RTAG PAR CHOS MI MTHUN PA'I PHYIR TE, KHYOD RTAG PA GANG ZHIG, SGRA MI RTAG PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Here is a proof that this is true:
Consider this same thing.
It is so true, that it is not a part of the group of similar
cases in this same proof,
Because it is not a changing thing.
Consider this same thing.
It is so true, that it is not a part of this same group in such
a way that it fits the name of the group,
Because it is not a thing which is similar to sounds in the
sense that they are both changing things: it is an
unchanging thing, and sound is a changing thing.

DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS KYI SGRA BSHAD DU YOD LA, DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS MA YIN PA'I MU NI MED DE, DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS KYI SGRA BSHAD DU YOD NA, DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS YIN DGOS PA'I PHYIR,
There does not exist anything which would qualify as the final permutation;
that is, something which was a part of the group of similar cases in such a way
that it fit the name of the group, but which was not a part of the group of
similar cases. This is because anything which is part of the group of similar
cases in such a way that it fits the name of the group must also be part of the
group of similar cases.

DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS ZHES PA'I PHYOGS DE YIN NA DE SGRUB KYI BSGRUB BYA'I CHOS YIN PAS MA KHYAB STE, SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PAR BYED PA'I MTHUN PHYOGS ZHES PA'I PHYOGS DANG DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS LA YOD CES PA'I PHYOGS GNYIS MI 'DRA BAR 'JOG DGOS PA'I PHYIR,
When we speak of the "group" (chok) in the "group of similar cases" (tunchok)
we are not necessarily speaking only of the quality to be proven in the
particular proof. This is because we have to draw a distinction between the
"group" in the "group of similar cases in a proof that sounds are changing
things" and being part of the group of similar cases in the same proof. [This
distinction has already been drawn for the reader in the translation above.]

MA KHYAB NA SLA, MA GRUB NA, DER THAL, SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PAR BYED PA'I PHYOGS KYI RJES SU DPAG BYA 'AM PHYOGS KYI SGRA'I 'JUG GZHI DE LA GSUM YOD PA LAS, DE SGRUB KYI PHYOGS CHOS ZHES PA'I PHYOGS DE DE SGRUB KYI SHES 'DOD CHOS CAN LA BYED, DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS LA YOD MED CES PA'I PHYOGS DE DANG DE SGRUB KYI KHYAB PA'I 'BREL YUL GYI PHYOGS DE GNYIS DE SGRUB KYI BSGRUB BYA'I CHOS SAM MI RTAG PA'I SPYI LDOG LA BYED KYANG ,
DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS ZHES PA'I PHYOGS DE LA MI RTAG PA'I SPYI LDOG DANG GZHI LDOG THAMS CAD 'JOG DGOS PA'I PHYIR,
It's easy to see how you would prove someone wrong if they replied, "It
doesn't necessarily follow."
Suppose though you say,
It's not correct [to say that we have to draw a distinction between
the "group" in the "group of similar cases in a proof that sounds
are changing things" and being part of the group of similar cases
in the same proof].
It is so correct to say this, because there are three different things that the word
chok can make you think of--there are three different things that the word chok
can refer to--when we speak of the "chok" in a proof that sounds are changing
things. The chok in the word chokchu ("relationship between the subject and the
reason") refers to the subject in the particular logical statement: the thing which
the opponent doubts possesses the quality to be proven.
Then there are pair of further uses of this word: the chok we use when we are
discussing whether or not something is part of the group of similar cases
(tunchok), and the chok we use when we are discussing the object related to,
within the necessary relationships in a logical statement (kyappay drelyul gyi
chok). Both of these refer to the general type represented by the quality to be
proven, or--in this case--the general type represented by "changing thing."
Finally there is the word chok as we use it in the expression "group of similar
cases" (tunchok) itself. Here the word must be understood as referring to
everything: to both the general type and the specific instance represented by
"changing thing."

DE SGRUB KYI MI MTHUN PHYOGS KYI SGRA BSHAD DU YOD NA, DE SGRUB KYI MI MTHUN PHYOGS YIN PAS KHYAB BAM ZHE NA,
One may ask the following question:
If something is part of the group of dissimilar cases for a
particular proof in such a way that it fits the name of the group,
is it then always something which is part of the group of
dissimilar cases for the particular proof?

'DI LA MU GSUM YOD DE, 'DUS MA BYAS KYI NAM MKHA' DE SGRA RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I MI MTHUN PHYOGS KYI SGRA BSHAD DU YOD LA, DE SGRUB KYI MI MTHUN PHYOGS MA YIN PA'I MU YIN,
Three permutations hold here. The unproduced thing which is empty space
is an example of the permutation where something is part of the group of
dissimilar cases in the proof that sounds are unchanging things in such a way
that it fits the name of the group, but is not part of the group of dissimilar
cases.

BUM PA DE SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I GNYIS KA MA YIN PA'I MU YIN,
A water pitcher would be an example of the permutation where something is
neither, in a proof that sound is a changing thing.

'DUS MA BYAS KYI NAM MKHA' DE SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I MI MTHUN PHYOGS KYI SGRA BSHAD DU YOD LA, DE SGRUB KYI MI MTHUN PHYOGS KYANG YIN PA'I MU YIN,
The unproduced thing which is empty space would be an example of the
permutation where something is both part of the group of dissimilar cases in
the proof that sounds are changing things in such a way that it fits the name
of the group; and is also part of the group of dissimilar cases.

DE SGRUB KYI MI MTHUN PHYOGS YIN LA, DE SGRUB KYI MI MTHUN PHYOGS KYI SGRA BSHAD DU MED PA'I MU NI MED DE, DE SGRUB KYI MI MTHUN PHYOGS YIN NA, DE SGRUB KYI MI MTHUN PHYOGS KYI SGRA BSHAD DU YOD PAS KHYAB PA'I PHYIR,
One permutation here does not hold: where something is part of the group of
dissimilar cases in the particular proof, but not part of the group of dissimilar
cases for the particular proof in such a way that it fits the name of the group.
This is because anything that is part of the group of dissimilar cases in a
particular proof is always part of the group of dissimilar cases in the particular
proof in such a way that it fits the name of the group.

BZHI PA MTHUN PHYOGS DANG MI MTHUN PHYOGS GNYIS DNGOS 'GAL YIN MIN LA DPYAD PA NI, MTHUN PHYOGS DE NI MI MTHUN PHYOGS DANG DNGOS 'GAL YIN KYANG , MI MTHUN PHYOGS MTHUN PHYOGS DANG DNGOS 'GAL MA YIN TE, MI MTHUN PHYOGS MED PA'I PHYIR,
Here lastly is the fourth point: an analysis of whether the groups of similar
cases and dissimilar cases are directly contradictory or not. The group of
similar cases stands in direct contradiction to the group of dissimilar cases, but
the group of dissimilar cases does not stand in direct contradiction to the
group of similar cases. This is because the group of dissimilar cases does not
exist.

And this is true because any object which can be established as existing is
always part of a group of similar cases. And this is because any object which
can be established as existing is always a part of a group of similar cases for
some correct reason. And this is because any object which can be established
as existing is always a part of the group of similar cases for a correct reason
in the proof that sound in a knowable thing.

On this point, someone might come and make the following claim:
It is so true, that the group of dissimilar cases exists,
Because there does exist a group of dissimilar cases for the
proof that sounds are changing things; and also
because there does exist a "correct statement of
proof that relates to what is dissimilar."
Our answer would be: it doesn't necessary follow.

[An actual example of a "correct statement of proof that relates to what is dissimilar"
would be the following:
Things that are unchanging are always things that are not
made--
It's like the example of empty space, an unproduced thing;
And so, sounds are things that are made.]

Here is the second major topic--an incidental treatment of the similar example
and the dissimilar example.

The definition of a similar example is: "Anything considered a similar
example." Anything that lacks a self-nature is always a similar example,
because anything which can be established as existing [that is, which does
exist,] is always a similar example, and anything which cannot be established
as existing [that is, which doesn't exist,] is also always a similar example.

DANG PO DER THAL, BUM PA DE DE YIN PA GANG ZHIG, MTSUNGS PA'I PHYIR, GNYIS PA DER THAL, RI BONG GI RVA DE DE YIN PA GANG ZHIG, MTSUNGS PA'I PHYIR,
[The first part of your statement is not correct.]
It is so true, that the first part of our statement is correct,
Because "water pitcher" is one [similar example], and it is equivalent [to the
case in question].
[The second part of your statement is not correct.]
It is so true, that the second part of our statement is correct,
Because "the horns on the head of a rabbit" is one [similar example], and it is
equivalent [to the case in question].

[The first part of your latest statement is not correct.]
Suppose you say that the first part of our last statement is not correct.
Consider the horns on the head of a rabbit.
They are too [a similar example],
Because they can be considered a similar example in a proof that sounds are
changing things.
And this is true because there could exist a logical statement where someone
said:
Consider sounds.
They are changing things,
Because they are things that are made;
It's just like the example of those [horns on a rabbit's
head].
It is also true because there could exist a statement of proof where someone
said:
Anything that is made
Is always something that is changing;
It's just like the example of those [horns on a rabbit's head].

Here is the definition of a similar example in a proof that sounds are changing
things:
Anything that can be considered a similar example in a proof that
sounds are changing things.

Anything that lacks a nature of its own is always just such an example,
Because anything that can be established as existing...(and then you can just
follow the same pattern as above). You can apply all this as well to a
proof where "because it is something made" is used as the reason for the
same assertion.

"Anything which is considered a dissimilar example" is not, however, the
definition of a dissimilar example. This is because no dissimilar example
exists: anything that can be established as existing is always a correct similar
example.

'ON KYANG SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I MI MTHUN DPE YANG DAG NI YOD PA GONG DU BSGRUBS ZIN,
There does however exist a correct dissimilar example for the proof that
sounds are changing things; we've established all this already, earlier on.
***************
The forms of debate:
The Two Responses to a Statement of a Reason
The great beauty of debate is that, assuming both parties stick to the rules of
logic, we must arrive at truth. If the attacker in any particular exchange poses
a series of questions in a correct, logical order, all the defender must do is give
very simple answers reflecting his own beliefs--answers like "yes," or
"no"--and sooner or later the truth will out. This is much like the way in
which a computer program works, with switches at each logical decision point,
turned "on" or "off" to indicate "yes" or "no"--and then continue on to this
branch, and answer "yes" or "no," until the flowchart takes you where you
must eventually go.
In an actual debate, the attacker will give his assertion in three parts: the
statement of the subject, the quality to be proven about the subject, and the
reason why this quality must be one that the subject possesses. He or she
might say, for example,

Consider sounds.
They are changing things,
Because they are something hot to touch.

SGRA CHOS CAN,
MI RTAG STE,
TSA BA'I REG BYA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Here "sounds" are the subject, "being a changing thing" is the quality we are
trying to prove about them, and "because they are things that are something
hot to touch" is the full statement of the reason we give to prove that this
quality does apply to the subject in question.
This is the most common form of logical statement in a Buddhist debate, and
in Tibetan ends with the word chir, which is the word for "because." (In
Tibetan sentence order, the "because" comes at the end.) A defender who hears
a statement ending in chir immediately begins to think of two possible answers.
The first answer is tak ma drup (rtags ma grub), which basically means, "the
reason you gave doesn't apply to the subject." In our case above this is to say,
"It's incorrect to say that sounds are something hot to touch."
Suppose that the attacker had instead made the following statement:
Consider sounds.
They are changing things,
Because they exist.

SGRA CHOS CAN,
MI RTAG STE,
YOD PA'I PHYIR,
Here it would be incorrect to answer tak ma drup, or "the reason you gave
doesn't apply to the subject," because it is true that "existing" applies to
"sounds"--that is, sounds do exist. Instead, the defender would answer kyappa
ma jung (khyab pa ma byung), or "it doesn't necessarily follow." This is the same

as saying, "I admit it's true that sounds exist, but it doesn't necessarily follow
then that they have to be changing things." After all, there are things--like
emptiness or empty space--which exist but are not changing things.
Both of these answers are equivalent to saying "no," but for different reasons.
They are the two classic answers because, if we assume a debate is about to
take place, the attacker should begin with something to argue
about--something the defender does not accept.
There are times in a debate though where an attacker is attempting to establish
a certain context--trying to get the defender to accept one thing in order to go
on to something else that he or she does not accept. An example would be the
following:
Consider sounds.
They are changing things,
Because they are things that are made.

SGRA CHOS CAN,
MI RTAG PA YIN TE,
BYAS PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
This is a correct statement, and so the defender answers "yes" or "right." The
way to give such an answer in the Tibetan language is to simply repeat the
verb that the opponent has used in his or her statement. With this last
statement, for example, the defender would simply say, Yin!--or "They are!"
meaning, "Yes! They are things that are made!"
The last thing to know about these answers is: Think carefully before you choose
which one to say! It's quite acceptable in a debate to mull over your opening
response carefully, since this already decides which side of the truth you will
end up at, when both you and your opponent reach the inevitable conclusion
of the flowchart.

things as they were the moment before the working things as they were

them are established as being the direct causes of those working things.

Suppose you say that it's not correct [to say that a working thing as it

Consider a working thing as it was the moment before it.
It is so true, that it is no material cause for the working thing,
Because there is no certainty that it will become the working thing.

***************
Formal logic subject:
The definition of a correct logical statement,
and the three relations

GNYIS PA RTAGS YANG DAG GI MTSAN NYID BSHAD PA LA, TSUL GSUM YIN PA, DE'I MTSAN NYID, TSUL GSUM GANG ZHE NA, PHYOGS CHOS, RJES KHYAB, LDOG KHYAB GSUM MO, , DE RNAMS SO SO'I MTSAN NYID, MTSAN GZHI, SGRUB BYED KYI RIGS PA DANG GSUM,
Here secondly we will explain the definition of a correct reason.
A correct reason is defined as:
A reason where the three relationships hold.
What are the three relationships? They are the following three: the relationship
between the subject and the reason; the positive necessity between the reason
and the quality to be proven; and the reverse necessity between the reason and
the quality to be proven. Here now we will give the definition, classical
examples, and supporting arguments for each.

DANG PO NI, DE SGRUB KYI SHES 'DOD CHOS CAN SKYON MED KYI STENG DU 'GOD TSUL DANG MTHUN PAR YOD PA NYID DU TSAD MAS NGES PA, DE SGRUB KYI PHYOGS CHOS KYI MTSAN NYID,
Here is the first. The "relationship between the subject and the reason" in any
particular proof is defined as holding when:
The reason is ascertained through valid perception to be
something that only applies to the subject of the proof--the object
about which the opponent entertains his doubt--in the way
asserted.

DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS KHO NA LA 'GOD TSUL DANG MTHUN PAR YOD PA NYID DU TSAD MAS NGES PA DE, DE SGRUB KYI RJES KHYAB KYI MTSAN NYID,
The "positive necessity between the reason and the quality to be proven" in any
particular proof is defined as holding when:
The reason is ascertained through valid perception to be
something that only applies to the group of similar cases for the
proof, in the way asserted.

The "reverse necessity between the reason and the quality to be proven" in any
particular proof is defined as holding when:
The reason is ascertained through valid perception to be
something that only fails to apply to the group of dissimilar cases
for the proof, in the way asserted, due to its relationship to the
general type represented by the explicit form of the quality to be
proven.

These definitions, however, are only meant to convey the principal sense of
what each relationship is; something can, however, satisfy one of them and still
not be a correct reason. Sound, for example, satisfies all three of these
definitions in a proof that sound is a changing thing, but is none of the things
defined by any of the three.

Suppose we now relate these in more detail, to specific applications. The
holding of the "relationship between the subject and the reason in a proof
where sound is proven to be a changing thing" can be defined as:
The reason is such that--
(1) "Sound" provides the subject about which the
opponent entertains doubt, in a proof where the
particular thing is being used as a reason in the
proof that sound is a changing thing; and
(2) This particular thing is also ascertained by a valid
perception only to apply to sound, in the way
asserted--while it is also the case that it and sound
are separate from each other.

The holding of the "positive necessity between the reason and the quality to be
proven in a proof where sound is proven to be a changing thing" can be
defined as:

The reason is such that--
(1) There does exist a correct "similar example,"
incorporating both the reason and the quality to be
proven;
(2) The reason is related to "changing thing"; and
(3) The reason is ascertained through valid perception to
be something that only applies to the group of
similar cases in the way asserted, in a proof where
sound is proven to be an unchanging thing.

The holding of the "negative necessity between the reason and the quality to
be proven in a proof where sound is proven to be a changing thing" can be
defined as:
The reason is such that--
(1) There does exist a correct "dissimilar example,"
involving both the reason and the quality to be
proven;
(2) The reason is related to "changing thing"; and
(3) The reason is ascertained through valid perception to
be something that only fails to apply to the group
of dissimilar cases in the way asserted, in a proof
where sound is proven to be an unchanging thing.

MTSAN GZHI NI, BYAS PA DE BYAS PA'I RTAGS KYIS SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I PHYOGS CHOS, RJES KHYAB, LDOG KHYAB GSUM KA YIN,
Here is the classical example. "Something which is made" is an example
where, in a proof where "something which is made" is being used as the reason
to prove that sound is something changing, all three hold: the relationship
between the subject and the reason; the positive necessity between the reason
and the quality to be proven; and the negative necessity between the reason
and the quality to be proven.

SGRUB BYED KYI RIGS PA NI, BYAS PA CHOS CAN, SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I PHYOGS CHOS YIN PAR THAL, MTSAN NYID DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Here next are the supporting arguments.
Consider "something which is made."
It is so a case where the relationship between the subject and the reason holds,
in a proof that sound is something changing,
Because it fits the definition given.

[which is to say, it is incorrect to say that "sound" provides the subject

Consider sound.
It does so provide the subject about which the opponent entertains doubt, in
a proof where "a thing which is made" is being used as a reason in the
proof that sound is a changing thing,

Because (1) it is considered the basis of contention in a proof where "a thing

Consider "something which is made."
It is so [also ascertained by a valid perception only to apply to sound, in the

Because (1) "something which is made" and sound are separate from each

Consider a water pitcher.
It is so a correct similar example, incorporating both the reason and the quality

Because (1) it can be considered a similar example in the proof where

Because there does exist a correct opponent for the particular proof
who--before he ascertains with valid perception that the fact that
"something which is made must always be something which is
changing" applies to sound--has already ascertained, with valid
perception, the fact that a water pitcher is a changing thing.
And this is true because there does exist a correct opponent for the proof that

verb used with the quality to be proven could have been either
"is" or "exists."]
The first of the two points is so true,
Because it has been set forth as a reason in the proof.

[The second of these two points is not correct: it's not correct to say that

Suppose you say that the second of the two points is not correct.
So is it then the case that "something which is made" is used here as a reason
which covers the entire group of similar cases in a proof where
"changing things exist" is being proven about sound?
Because there does exist a reason which covers the entire group of similar
cases in the particular proof.

'DOD NA, SHES BYA CHOS CAN, BYAS PA YIN PAR THAL, MI RTAG PA YOD PA'I PHYIR,
[I agree to your statement that "something which is made" is used here
as a reason which covers the entire group of similar cases in a

Suppose you agree with our statement.
Consider all knowable things.
So are they then something which is made?
Because changing things exist with them.

RTAGS GSUM PA DER THAL, BYAS PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[The third part of your reason above is incorrect: the reason given is not
a changing thing.]
The third part of our reason above is so correct,
Because the reason given is "something which is made."

RTAGS BZHI PA 'BUD DO,
And we can throw out any objection to the fourth part of our reason, [which
states that anything which is something made is automatically a changing
thing].

BYAS PA CHOS CAN, SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I LDOG KHYAB YIN PAR THAL, MTSAN NYID DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Consider [the reason] "something which is made."
It is so true, that the negative necessity holds with it in a proof that sound is
a changing thing,
Because it fits the given definition.

RTZA RTAGS DANG PO GRUB TE, 'DUS MA BYAS KYI NAM MKHA' DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[It's not correct to say that it fits the first part of the original definition;
that is, there does not exist a correct "dissimilar example,"
involving both the reason and the quality to be proven.]
It does fit the first part [of the original definition of whether the negative
necessity holds],
Because "empty space, an unproduced thing" is just such an example.

RTZA RTAGS GNYIS PA SGRUB ZIN, RTZA RTAGS GSUM PA GRUB STE, MI RTAG PA MA YIN PA LA BYAS PA MED PA'I PHYIR,
We have already established that it fits the second part [of the original
definition; that is, the reason ("something made") does relate to
"changing thing"].
It does fit the third part [of the original definition; that is, "something which
is made" is ascertained through valid perception to be something that
only fails to apply to the group of dissimilar cases in the way asserted,
in a proof where sound is proven to be an unchanging thing],
Because nothing which is made ever applies to those things which are not
changing.
***************
The forms of debate:
Formulating a statement of necessity
One of the most powerful tools in logic, and in the debate ground, is called the
"statement of necessity," which is telngyur in Tibetan (thal-'gyur) and prasan¯gika
in Sanskrit. This form of logical statement is believed by the highest school of
Buddhism, the upper half of the Madhyamika or Middle-Way Group of
philosophers, to have the power to give an opponent a correct understanding
of emptiness even before going on to a standard assertion--and because of this
belief, the school is called the "Madhyamika Prasangika," or the "Necessity"
School of the Middle-Way Group.
The word "necessity" here most often implies an absurdity which would be a
necessary consequence if the opponent's incorrect statement were true. As
such, the name of the highest school is sometimes rendered into English as the
"Consequence" School of the Middle-Way Group.
In debate, a statement of necessity is most often used right after the opponent
has objected to a standard assertion, such as in the following example. We
have just given the statement,
Consider sound.
It is a changing thing,
Because it is a thing which is made.

SGRA CHOS CAN,
MI RTAG STE,
BYAS PA'I PHYIR,
The opponent then answered,
Your reason is incorrect. (Which is to say, "Sound is not
a thing which is made.")

RTAGS MA GRUB,
We then reply with a statement of necessity, in this case pointing out an
absurd consequence of our opponent's position:
Let's consider sound again.
So is it then something which is unchanging?

SGRA CHOS CAN,
RTAG PA YIN PAR THAL,
Whenever we are using a statement of necessity in the sense of pointing out
an absurd consequence of the opponent's position, our voice in the Tibetan
descends at the end of the statement, on the word tel. In Tibetan this is the
equivalent of a sarcastic statement like "Oh, so I suppose you're telling me then
that sound is an unchanging thing?"
There are however also times when we use a statement of necessity to express
something that we do believe is necessarily true. An example would be the
following statement, which we might use in debate if the opponent has said
"That's right" to our last statement above. (In other words, he has said, "It's
right that sound is something which is unchanging.")
Let's consider sound again.
It is not the case that it is something which is unchanging,
Because it is a working thing.

SGRA CHOS CAN,
RTAG PA MA YIN PAR THAL,
DNGOS PO YIN PA'I PHYIR,
In this case, because we believe in the statement, our voice in Tibetan rises at
the end of the statement, again on the word tel. This is the equivalent in
Tibetan of something like "I told you so! Sound could never be something
which is unchanging!"
A statement of necessity in debate, finally, often follows a statement of a
general truth, such as the following. Suppose an opponent comes and says,
If something is the color of a flower, it must always be a
white color.

ME TOG GI KHA DOG YIN NA, KHA DOG DKAR PO YIN PA'I KHYAB,
We would then retaliate with,
Consider the color of a red rose.
So is it then a white color?
Because it is the color of a flower.

RGYAL SRAS ME TOG DMAR PO'I KHA DOG CHOS CAN,
KHA DOG DKAR PO YIN PAR THAL,
ME TOG GI KHA DOG YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Of course in this case our voice would drop on the tel, indicating that we
ourselves would never believe this absurd consequence of our opponent's
position. In the next lesson, we will learn about the traditional responses to a
statement of necessity.

Here next is a presentation on the concepts of negative and positive. We will
first refute the position of our opponents, then present our own position, and
then finally eliminate their rebuttal.
Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
Anything which is a working thing must always be something
positive.

SGRA MI RTAG PA CHOS CAN, SGRUB PA YIN PAR THAL, DNGOS PO YIN PA'I PHYIR, KHYAB PA KHAS,
Consider the fact that sound is not unchanging.
So is it then something positive?
Because it is a working thing.
[It doesn't necessarily follow.]
But you already agreed that it does necessarily follow.

'DOD NA, SGRA MI RTAG PA CHOS CAN, SGRUB PA MA YIN PAR THAL, DGAG PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[Then I agree to your original statement: the fact that sound is not

Suppose you agree to our original statement.
Consider the fact that sound is not unchanging.
It is not so, that it is something positive,
Because it is something negative.

[It's not correct to say that the fact that sound is not unchanging is
something negative.]
It is so,
Because (1) it is a thing which must be perceived by the state of mind that
perceives it directly through the process of eliminating, directly, the
thing that it denies; and (2) it is a thing which must be expressed
through a process where the wording used to express it does so through
a process of eliminating, directly, the thing that it denies.

[The second part of your last statement is not correct: the fact that
sound is not unchanging is not a thing which must be expressed
through a process where the actual wording used to express it

The second part of our last statement is so true,
Because the expression "sound is not unchanging" is one where the fact that
sound is not unchanging is expressed through eliminating, directly, the
idea that sound is something unchanging--by saying so explicitly.

Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
If something is a negative thing in the sense of not being

RTAG PA CHOS CAN, DER THAL, DE'I PHYIR, KHYAB PA KHAS,
Consider an unchanging thing.
So is it then [always such that the term which expresses it implies something
else--either a negative in the sense of not being something, or a

Because it is [a negative thing in the sense of not being something].

Suppose you say that it's not correct.

It is so a negative thing in the sense of not being something,
Because (1) it is a negative thing, and (2) it is not a negative thing in the sense
of being the absence of something.

You can't agree with the original statement above,

It is so,

Consider a thing which is made.

Suppose you say it's not correct.
Consider a thing which is made.
It is so such that the term which expresses it implies something else--either a

And suppose you say that it's not correct [to say that the fact that sound

It is so,
Because the expression "sound is something which is made" is a thing
which must be expressed in such a way that eliminates the

Our answer to this is, "It doesn't necessarily follow" [that, because the

Here secondly is the presentation of our own position. There does exist a

A thing which must be perceived by the state of mind which

that which it denies.

2) Those where the term which expresses them does this implying

There does exist the first type, the kind which are such that the term which

Suppose you say that this is not correct.
Consider this same thing.
It is so true that it is the kind of negative thing which is such that the term
which expresses it directly implies something else--either a negative in
the sense of not being something, or a positive--incidental to denying
what it denies directly in the actual wording,
Because (1) the term which expresses it denies what it denies directly in the
actual wording; and (2) it also directly implies something else--either
a negative in the sense of not being something, or a positive.

But the first part of our reason is correct,
Because the expression "the fact that the fact that no person has any nature of

possibility that any nature of their own that belonged to some person

not being something, or a positive.]
But the second part of our reason is correct,
Because the expression "the fact that the fact that no person has any nature of
their own is true of a water pitcher" (1) directly implies that the fact that
no person has any nature of their own exists, and (2) the fact that the
fact that no person has any nature of their own is true of a water pitcher

It is so,
Because (1) the expression "John Smith, who is chubby, never eats during the

It is so correct to say just this,
Because (1) the expression "There exists a John Smith who is chubby, who
doesn't eat during the day, and who has a body that is not a thin one,"
indirectly implies that he eats at night--and directly implies that there
is a body which is not thin--incidental to denying directly that he eats

term which expresses it implies through the context something else--either a
negative in the sense of not being something, or a positive--incidental to
denying what it denies directly in the actual wording, because one would be

where you had determined that a particular person must be either of the royal
caste or the Brahmin caste, but were unsure of which; and then someone says
"They are not a Brahmin." The actual wording here directly denies, in its
actual wording, that they are a Brahmin, and then implies--through the
context--that they are of the royal caste; and this is the process you have to go

natures. We will proceed in three steps: the definition, the divisions, and the
classical examples.

DANG PO NI, RANG BZHIN GYI TSUL GSUM YIN PA, RANG BZHIN GYI RTAGS YANG DAG GI MTSAN NYID, DE SGRUB KYI RANG BZHIN GYI TSUL GSUM YIN PA, DE SGRUB KYI RANG BZHIN GYI RTAGS YANG DAG GI MTSAN NYID,
Here is the first. The definition of a correct reason of the type that uses a
nature is as follows:
A reason where the three relationships hold, and which utilizes
a nature.
The definition of a correct reason of the type that uses a nature in any
particular proof is as follows:
A reason where the three relationships hold, and which utilizes
a nature, in any particular proof.

YANG NA KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI RTAGS YANG DAG GANG ZHIGKHYOD KYI RTAGS KYIS DE SGRUB KYI DNGOS KYI BSGRUB BYA'I CHOS SU BZUNG BYA YIN NA, KHYOD DANG BDAG NYID GCIG YIN DGOS PA'I CHA NAS BZHAG PA DE, KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI RANG BZHIN GYI RTAGS YANG DAG GI MTSAN NYID,
The definition of a correct reason of the type that uses a nature in any
particular proof can also be defined as follows:
A reason which is (1) a correct reason in any particular proof,
and (2) which is established as being this kind of reason [one that
uses a nature] by virtue of the fact that anything considered the
explicit quality to be proven for the particular proof in which it
serves as the reason is necessarily such that to be it [the reason]
is to be the quality.

GNYIS PA DE LA DBYE NA, DE SGRUB KYI KHYAD PAR LTOS PA BA'I RANG BZHIN KYI RTAGS YANG DAG DANG , DE SGRUB KYI KHYAD PAR DAG PA BA'I RANG BZHIN GYI RTAGS YANG DAG GNYIS,
Here is the second step. Correct reasons that utilize a nature can be divided
into two different types: correct reasons that utilize a nature and which are
such that they depend on a certain distinction, [of suggesting the thing that
made it]; and correct reasons that utilize a nature and which are such they are
free of dependency on a certain distinction, [of suggesting the thing that made
it].

DANG PO'I MTSAN NYID NI, DE SGRUB KYI RANG BZHIN GYI RTAGS YANG DAG GANG ZHIGRNG BRJOD PA'I SGRAS RANG GI BYED PA PO 'PHEN PA'I CHA NAS BZHAG PA, DANG PO'I MTSAN NYID,
Here is the definition of the first:
A reason which is (1) a correct reason for any particular proof
which utilizes a nature; and (2) which is established as being this
kind of reason by virtue of the fact that the term which expresses
it suggests the thing that made it.

DE GANG ZHIGRNG BRJOD PA'I SGRAS RANG GI BYED PA PO MI 'PHEN PA'I CHA NAS BZHAG PA, GNYIS PA'I MTSAN NYID,
The definition of the second is as follows:
A reason which is (1) the same as the first part just given; and (2)
which is established as being this kind of reason by virtue of the
fact that the term which expresses it does not suggest the thing
that made it.

DANG PO LA YANG , RANG GI BYED PA PO DNGOS SU 'PHANGS PA DANG , DE SHUGS LA 'PHANGS PA GNYIS YOD,
The first type may be further divided into two: those which suggest the thing
that made them directly, and those which do so indirectly.

GSUM PA MTSAN GZHI NI, RTZOL BYUNG DANG , SKYES PA, DUNG SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I DANG PO DANG , BYAS PA SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I GNYIS PA, DNGOS PO SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I KHYAD PAR DAG PA BA'I RANG BZHIN GYI RTAGS YANG DAG GO,
Here thirdly are the classical examples. "A thing which is produced by
conscious effort" and "a thing which is brought about" are examples of the first
type of reason, in a proof that the sound of a ritual horn is a changing thing.
"A thing which is made" is an example of the second type of reason, in a proof
that sound is a changing thing. "A working thing" is an example of a correct
reason which utilizes a nature and which is such it is free of dependency on
a certain distinction, [of suggesting the thing that made it].

YANG SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I RANG BZHIN GYI RTAGS YANG DAG LA DBYE NA, DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS LA KHYAB BYED DU 'JUG PA'I DE SGRUB KYI RANG BZHIN GYI RTAGS YANG DAG DANG , DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS LA RNAM GNYIS SU 'JUG PA'I DE SGRUB KYI RANG BZHIN GYI RTAGS YANG DAG GNYIS,
A correct reason which utilizes a nature and which is employed in the proof
that sound is a changing thing can also be divided in a different way. This
division would be into the two of (1) correct reasons which utilize a nature and
which apply to the entire group of similar cases for the proof; and (2) correct
reasons which utilize a nature and which both apply and fail to apply to the
group of similar cases for the proof.

MTSAN GZHI RIM PA LTAR, BYAS PA DANG PO DANG , BYAS PA'I BYE BRAG GNYIS PA YIN,
Respective examples would be the reason "a thing which is made," and the
reason "something characteristic of the quality of being made."

DE GNYIS SGRUB PA NI, , BYAS PA DE DANG PO YIN TE, DE DE SGRUB KYI RANG BZHIN GYI RTAGS YANG DAG GANG ZHIG MI RTAG PA YIN NA, DE YIN PAS KHYAB PA'I PHYIR,
Here is a demonstration for each of these.
"A thing which is made" is the first kind of reason,
Because it is (1) a correct reason for the particular proof which utilizes a
nature; and (2) it is such that, if something is a changing thing, it must
always be it [that is, a thing which is made].

BYAS PA'I BYE BRAG GNYIS PA YIN TE, DE DE SGRUB KYI RANG BZHIN GYI RTAGS YANG DAG GANG ZHIGMI RTAG PA YIN NA, DE YIN PAS MA KHYAB PA'I PHYIR,
"Something characteristic of the quality of being made" is the second kind of
reason,
Because it is (1) a correct reason for the particular proof which utilizes a
nature; and (2) it is such that, if something is a changing thing, it is not
necessarily it [that is, something characteristic of the quality of being
made].

***************
The forms of debate:
Using Scriptural Authority
In Buddhist debate, we can prove a thing in two ways: we can prove it with
logic, and we can prove it with scriptural authority; that is, by quoting a
scripture which is accepted by the opponent. In Tibetan these two are known,
respectively, as rikpa (rigs-pa) and lung (lung)--and the idea is so important that
some monks (such as Khen Rinpoche's devoted attendant) are give the name
"Lungrik." Quoting scripture must obviously be used with care when
attempting to demonstrate something to a person who is not yet a Buddhist,
since they may very well deny the authority you are quoting.
Favorite texts to quote in the monastery are the older scriptures from India:
either the word of Lord Buddha himself, or the word of one of the great early
Indian masters, as found in the Kangyur and Tengyur collections of the great
classics of India translated into Tibetan. These are accepted by all schools of
Tibetan Buddhism. In a debate between monasteries which are all of the
Gelukpa tradition--such as the annual winter debates attended primarily by
monks of the "Great Three" monasteries of Sera, Ganden, and Drepung--the
favorite works to cite would be those of Je Tsongkapa or one of his major
disciples: Gyaltsab Je, Kedrup Je, or His Holiness the First Dalai Lama.
In everyday debates at your own home monastery, you would normally quote
from one of the monastic textbooks that are unique to the curriculum of each
individual monastery; these are known as yikcha (yig-cha). These textbooks
have developed over the last five hundred years much in the same way as the
ACI course notebooks, and similar courses in the West.
The ammunition for using a quotation in the debate ground must of course be
prepared in advance: no one can bring a scrap of paper into the area, and all
quotations must be recited from memory. One way to get a good booing from
the assembled crowd is to start a quotation and then flounder, unable to finish
it from memory!
A scriptural citation is normally used to back up an assertion just given as a
reason in a proof, and it is often introduced with a great flourish, emphasizing
the indisputability and greatness of the source you have selected. You might
see, for example, the following, where we start out with:

Consider sound.

SGRA CHOS CAN,
It is a changing thing,

MI RTAG STE,
Because it is something which is made.

BYAS PA'I PHYIR,
The opponent replies with:
Your reason is wrong!

RTAGS MA GRUB,
Meaning, sound is not a thing which is made. We then reply with,
Consider sound.

SGRA CHOS CAN,
It is so something which is made,

BYAS PA YIN PAR THAL,
Because it was spoken to be that way by the High and Holy One, the
Good and Glorious Kedrup Tenpa Dargye, a Master (Ke) Who
has Found All Attainments (Drup), and Whose Kindness to All
of Us is Infinitely High; and because His words are something
that you must accept!

BDAG CAG RNAMS LA BKA' DRIN KHYAD PAR DU 'PHAGS PA MKHAS SHING GRUB PA 
RNYED PA RJE BTZUN MKHAS GRUB BSTAN PA DAR RGYAS DPAL BZANG POS DE 
LTAR GSUNGS PA GANG ZHIGKHS LEN DGOS YIN PA'I PHYIR,
And he did so speak it be this way, because he did so in his Overview
of the Perfection of Wisdom, with the following words: "When we
use 'something which is made' as a reason to prove that sound
is a changing thing."

YIN PAR THAL, DE NYID KYIS BRTZOOMS PA'I PHAR PHYIN SPYI DON LAS, BYAS PA'I 
RTAGS LA BRTEN NAS SGRA MI RTAG PA RTOGS PA ZHES SOGS GSUNGS PA'I 
PHYIR,
Kedrup Tenpa Dargye (1493-1568) is the principal author of the textbook series
of Sera Mey; he is therefore, for the monks of Sera Mey, an indisputable
authority, and his words must be accepted.
A typical strategy once an opponent has resorted to scriptural authority is to
respond that, despite the fact that such a statement was once made by that
authority, it does not necessarily prove what the opponent claims that it does.
In such a case, the other side in the debate just described might come back
with:
"It doesn't necessarily follow!"

KHYAB PA MA BYUNG ,
Whenever someone contradicts scripture, it's time to pull out the unique
response used by monks from Sera Mey. (Other monasteries have their own
slightly different version.) Here you scream the following at the top of your
lungs, and then go on to the formula above:
You contradict the scriptures! You contradict the holy scriptures!

and Relationship ('Gal-'brel gyi rnam-bzhag), from An Explanation of the
Intermediate Path of Reasoning (Rigs-lam 'bring-gi rnam-par bshad-pa), by the
Master Tutor Purbuchok Jampa Tsultrim Gyatso (1825-1901), who in his day held the
position of Tutor to the Dalai Lama.

DANG PO 'GAL 'BREL LA DGAG BZHAG SPONG GSUM LAS, DANG PO NI, KHA CIG NA RE, DNGOS PO DANG 'GAL BA YIN NA, DNGOS PO DANG 'GAL BA DANG 'GAL BA YIN PAS KHYAB ZER NA,
Here is the first section: an explanation of the concepts of contradiction and
relationship. For this presentation we will first refute the position of our
opponents, then present our own position, and then finally eliminate their
rebuttal.
Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
Anything which is such that being it is contradictory to being a
working thing is always something which is such that being it is
contradictory to being something which is such that being it is
contradictory to being a working thing.

RTAG PA'I LDOG PA CHOS CAN, DER THAL, DE'I PHYIR,
Consider the exclusion of all that is not an unchanging thing.
So is being it then [something which is such that being it is contradictory to
being something which is such that being it is contradictory to being a
working thing]?
Because being it is [something which is such that being it is contradictory to
being a working thing].

MA GRUB NA, DER THAL, KHYOD DNGOS PO DANG THA DAD GANG ZHIG, KHYOD KYANG YIN DNGOS PO YANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN MED PA'I PHYIR,
[It's not correct to say that the exclusion of all that is not an unchanging
thing is something which is such that being it is contradictory to
being a working thing.]
Suppose you say it's not correct.
It is so correct,
Because (1) it [the exclusion of all that is not an unchanging thing] is
something distinct from a working thing, and (2) there exists no one
thing which is both it [the exclusion of all that is not an unchanging
thing] and a working thing.

DANG PO MA GRUB NA, DE CHOS CAN, DNGOS PO DANG THA DAD YIN PAR THAL, RTAG PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[The first part of your statement is not correct: it's not correct to say that
the exclusion of all that is not an unchanging thing is something
distinct from a working thing.]
Suppose you say that the first part of our statement is not correct.
Consider this same thing.
It is so distinct from being a working thing,
Because it is an unchanging thing.

GNYIS PA MA GRUB NA, RTAG PA CHOS CAN, KHYOD KYI LDOG PA YANG YIN, DNGOS PO YANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN MED PAR THAL, KHYOD RTAG PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[The second part of your statement is not correct: it's not correct to say
that there exists no one thing which is both the exclusion all that
is not an unchanging thing, and also a working thing.]
Suppose you say that the second part of our statement is not correct.
Consider an unchanging thing.
It is so true that there exists no one thing which is both the exclusion of all
that is not it, and also a working thing,
Because it is unchanging.

RTZA BAR 'DOD NA, RTAG PA'I LDOG PA CHOS CAN, DNGOS PO DANG 'GAL BA DANG 'GAL BA MA YIN PAR THAL, DNGOS PO DANG 'GAL BA DANG MI 'GAL BA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[Then I agree to your original statement: the exclusion of all that is not
an unchanging thing is such that being it is contradictory to
being something which is such that being it is contradictory to
being a working thing]
Consider the exclusion of all that is not an unchanging thing.
It is not so true, that it is such that being it is contradictory to being something
which is such that being it is contradictory to being a working thing,
Because being it is something which is such that being it is not contradictory
to being something which such that being it is contradictory to being a
working thing.

MA GRUB NA, DE CHOS CAN, DER THAL, KHYOD KYANG YIN, DNGOS PO DANG 'GAL BA YANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN YOD PA'I PHYIR,
[It's not correct to say that the exclusion of all that is not an unchanging
thing is such that being it is not contradictory to being something
which is such that being it is contradictory to being a working
thing.]
Suppose you say it's not correct.
Consider this same thing.
It is so,
Because there does exist one thing which is both it, and which is also such that
being it is contradictory to being a working thing.

RTAG PA DE, DE 'DRA'I GZHI MTHUN YIN PA'I PHYIR,
And this is because an unchanging thing is just such a thing.

KHA CIG NA RE, MI RTAG PA DANG 'GAL BA DANG 'GAL BA YIN NA, MI RTAG PA DANG 'GAL BA YIN PAS KHYAB ZER NA,
Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
If something is such that being it is contradictory to being
something which is such that being it is contradictory to being
something which is unchanging, then it is always something such
that being it is contradictory to being something which is
changing.

KA BA'I LDOG PA CHOS CAN, DER THAL, DE'I PHYIR,
Consider the exclusion of all that is not a pillar.
So is it then [something such that being it is contradictory to being something
which is changing]?
Because it is [something which is such that being it is contradictory to being
something which is such that being it is contradictory to being
something which is unchanging].

MA GRUB NA, DE CHOS CAN, DER THAL, MI RTAG PA DANG 'GAL BA DANG THA DAD GANG 
ZHIGKHYOD KYANG YIN, MI RTAG PA DANG 'GAL BA YANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN MED PA'I PHYIR,
[It's not correct to say that the exclusion of all that is not a pillar is
something such that being it is contradictory to being something
which is such that being it is contradictory to being something
which is unchanging.]
Suppose you say it's not correct.
Consider this same thing.
It is so,
Because it is (1) distinct from that which is such that being it is contradictory
to being a changing thing, and (2) such that there does not exist a single

thing which is both it [the exclusion of all that is not a pillar] and also
something which is such that being it is contradictory to being a
changing thing.

MA GRUB NA, KA BA CHOS CAN, KHYOD KYI LDOG PA YANG YIN, MI RTAG PA DANG 'GAL BA YANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN MED PAR THAL, KHYOD KYI LDOG PA YIN NA, MI RTAG PA DANG MI 'GAL BA YIN PAS KHYAB PA'I PHYIR,
[It's not correct to say that the exclusion of all that is not a pillar is (1)
distinct from that which is such that being it is contradictory to
being a changing thing, and (2) such that there does not exist a
single thing which is both the exclusion of all that is not a pillar
and also something which is such that being it is contradictory to
being a changing thing.]
Suppose you say that it's not correct.
Consider a pillar.
It is so true that there does not exist a single thing which is both the exclusion
of all that is not a pillar and also something which is such that being it
is contradictory to being a changing thing,
Because anything which is the exclusion of all that is not it [a pillar] is always
such that being it is not contradictory to being a changing thing.

RTZA BAR 'DOD NA, KA BA'I LDOG PA CHOS CAN, MI RTAG PA DANG 'GAL BA MA YIN PAR THAL, MI RTAG PA DANG MI 'GAL BA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[Then I agree to your original statement: the exclusion of all that is not
a pillar is such that being it is contradictory to being something
which is changing.]
Suppose you agree to our original statement.
Consider the exclusion of all that is not a pillar.
It is not such, that being it is contradictory to being a changing thing,
Because it is such that being it is not contradictory to being a changing thing.
 MA GRUB NA, DE CHOS CAN, DER THAL, KHYOD KYANG YIN, MI RTAG PA YANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN YOD PA'I PHYIR TE, KA BA DE DE 'DRA'I GZHI MTHUN YIN PA'I PHYIR, RTAGS SLA,
[It's not correct to say that the exclusion of all that is not a pillar is such
that being it is not contradictory to being a changing thing.]
Suppose you say it's not correct.
Consider this same thing.
It is so this way,
Because there does exist one thing which is both it [the exclusion of all that is
not a pillar] and also a changing thing;
And this is true because a pillar itself is just such a thing.
This reason is easy to accept.

KHA CIG NA RE, DNGOS PO DANG MI 'GAL BA YIN NA, DNGOS PO DANG MI 'GAL BA DANG MI 'GAL BA YIN PAS KHYAB ZER NA,
Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
If something is such that being it is not contradictory to being a
working thing, then it is always such that being it is not
contradictory with being something which is not contradictory to
being a working thing.

KA BUM GNYIS DANG GCIG CHOS CAN, DER THAL, DE'I PHYIR,
Consider that which is one and the same as the two of a pillar and a water
pitcher.
So is it then [such that being it is not contradictory with being something that
is not contradictory to being a working thing]?
Because it is [such that being it is not contradictory to being a working thing].

Suppose you say it's not correct.

Consider this same thing.
It is so,
Because there does exist one thing which is both it [that which is one and the

And this is because the two of a pillar and a water pitcher is just such a thing.

If you say it's not correct, the answer is easy.
Suppose though you agree to our original statement, [saying that that which
is one and the same as the two of a pillar and a water pitcher is such
that being it is not contradictory with being something which is not
contradictory to being a working thing].
Consider that which is one and the same as the two of a pillar and a water
pitcher.
It is so not something which is such that being it is not contradictory to being
something which is not contradictory to being a working thing,
Because it is something such that being it is contradictory to being something
which is not contradictory to being a working thing.

Suppose you say that it's not correct.
Consider this same thing.
It is so,
Because (1) it is distinct from that which is such that being it is not

Suppose you say that it's not correct.
Consider the two of a pillar and a water pitcher.
It is so true that there exists no one thing which is both it and also something

Because it is something which no one thing can be.

then it is always such that being it is not contradictory to being

DNGOS MED CHOS CAN, DER THAL, DE'I PHYIR,
Consider a thing which does no work.

Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
If something is such that being it is not contradictory to being a

always such that being it is contradictory to being an unchanging
thing.

MA BYAS PA CHOS CAN, DER THAL, DE'I PHYIR,
Consider a thing which is not made.
Is it then [such that being it is contradictory to being an unchanging thing]?
Because it is [such that being it is not contradictory to being a thing which is
contradictory to being a existing thing].

Suppose you say it's not correct.
Consider this same thing.
It is so,
Because there does exist one thing which is both (1) it [that is, a thing which
is not made] and (2) such that being it is contradictory to being an

And this is true because the two of unchanging things and changing things is
just such a thing.

Suppose you agree to our original statement.
It is not so, that it is such that being it is contradictory to being an unchanging

Because it is such that being it is not contradictory to being just such a thing.
 MA GRUB NA, DE CHOS CAN, DER THAL, RTAG PA YIN NA, KHYOD DANG RTAG PA'I GZHI MTHUN YIN PAS KHYAB PA'I PHYIR,
[It's not correct to say that a thing which is not made is such that being

Because anything which is an unchanging thing is such that it is one thing
which is both itself and unchanging.

KHA CIG NA RE, DNGOS PO DANG 'BREL BA YIN NA, DNGOS PO DANG 'BREL BA DANG 'BREL BA YIN PAS KHYAB ZER NA,
Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
Anytime something is such that it is sharing a relationship with
a working thing, it must also always be such that it shares a
relationship with what is sharing a relationship with a working
thing.

DNGOS PO DANG 'BREL BA CHOS CAN, DER THAL, DE'I PHYIR,
Consider sharing a relationship with a working thing.
So is it then [such that it shares a relationship with what is sharing a

Suppose, relative to this same point, someone comes and says:
It is so, that there does exist a typical example which

Because there does exist one thing which is (1) something which is such
that being it is not contradictory to being something which is

and (4) something which does share a relationship with

Our answer to this is, "It doesn't necessarily follow."

Suppose you say it's not correct.
Consider something which is such that being it is contradictory to being a

It is so just such a combination,

Because it is (1) something which is such that being it is not contradictory to
being something which is such that being it is contradictory to being a

The first and second elements in our reason are easy to accept.
Suppose you say that the third is not correct.
Consider this same thing [something which is such that being it is
contradictory to being a pillar].
It is so something which does not share a relationship with something which
does share a relationship with this thing [the pillar],

a relationship ceased to exist, it too would have to cease to exist;

Consider something which is such that being it is contradictory to being a

It is so something which shares a relationship with something which shares no

is no one thing which can be both it and something which is
contradictory;
And this is because being contradictory is not something which is
contradictory.

GNYIS PA RANG LUGS BZHAG PA LA, 'GAL BA LA MTSAN NYID DANG DBYE BA GNYIS,
Here is the second part, where we present our own position. We proceed in
two steps, covering the definition of what it is to be in contradiction, and then
the different types of contradiction.

DANG PO NI, KHYOD THA DAD KYANG YIN, KHYOD YIN PA MI SRID PA YANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN DU DMIGS PA DE, RANG NYID 'GAL BA YIN PA'I MTSAN NYID,
Here is the definition of what it is for two things to be in contradiction:
The two things must (1) be distinct from each other, and then
they must be such that (2) it is impossible for any one thing to be
both of them.

GNYIS PA 'GAL BA LA DBYE NA, PHAN TSUN SPANG 'GAL DANG , LHAN CIG MI GNAS 'GAL GNYIS,
There are two different ways of being in contradiction: contradictory in the
sense of being mutually exclusive; and contradictory in the sense of being
diametrically opposed.

DANG PO NI, RNAM BCAD YONGS GCOD KYI SGO NAS MI MTHUN PAR GNAS PA, PHAN TSUN SPANG 'GAL GYI MTSAN NYID, DE DANG 'GAL BA GNYIS DON 
The definition of the first of these, to be contradictory in the sense of being
mutually exclusive, is as follows:
Two things which conflict with each other in such a way that the
presence of one automatically means the absence of the other.
The two terms "contradictory in the sense of being mutually exclusive" and
"contradictory" refer to the same thing.

GCIGDE LA DBYE NA, DNGOS 'GAL DANG , BRGYUD 'GAL GNYIS, PHAN TSUN DNGOS SU MI MTHUN PAR GNAS PA, DNGOS 'GAL GYI MTSAN NYID, DNGOS SU GNOD BYA GNOD BYED MA YIN ZHING , GZHI MI MTHUN PAR GNAS PA, BRGYUD 'GAL GYI MTSAN NYID,
Things which are contradictory in the sense of being mutually exclusive may
be further divided into two types: those which contradict each other in this
way directly; and those which contradict each other in this way indirectly.
The definition of things which contradict each other in this way directly is
"Two things which conflict with each other directly." The definition of things
which contradict each other in this way indirectly is "Two things which are
such that no one thing can be both, but which are not such that one
immediately obviates the other."

DANG PO'I MTSAN GZHI NI, DNGOS PO DANG DNGOS MED GNYIS LTA BU, GNYIS PA'I MTSAN GZHI NI, TSA GRANG GNYIS DANG , BDAG 'DZIN DANG BDAG MED RTOGS PA'I SHES RAB GNYIS LTA BU,
A typical example of the first would be something like the two of "working
thing" and "a thing which does no work." A typical example of the second

would be "heat" and "coldness," or else "the state of mind which holds that
things have some nature of their own" and "the wisdom which realizes that
nothing has a nature of its own."

GNYIS PA NI, RGYUN BCAD BYA GCOD BYED KYI SGO NAS MI MTHUN PAR GNAS PA, LHAN CIG MI GNAS 'GAL GYI MTSAN NYID,
Here is the definition of the second kind of contradiction--of things which are
contradictory in the sense of being diametrically opposed:
Two things which conflict with each other in such a way that
each one acts to stop the continued existence of the other.

MTSAN GZHI NI, GNYEN PO DANG SPANG BYA GNYIS LTA BU,
A typical example would be a spiritual antidote and the negative personal
quality which it allows you to eliminate.

CHOS DE DANG BDAG GCIG 'BREL GYI MTSAN NYID YOD DE, KHYOD CHOS DE DANG BDAG NYID GCIG PA'I SGO NAS THA DAD, CHOS DE MED NA KHYOD MED DGOS PA'I CHOS DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
The definition of what it is to share a relationship with something else in such
a way that to be the first is to automatically be the other is as follows:
Whenever two existing things are such that, to be the first is by
nature to be the second, but in such a way that they are separate
things; and where--if the second were to cease to exist--then the
first would have to cease to exist as well.

MTSAN GZHI NI, BUM PA DANG BUM PA'I LDOG PA LTA BU,
An example would be the relation between a vase and the exclusion of all that
is not the vase.

GZHI LA SBYAR NA, DNGOS PO DANG BDAG NYID GCIG PA'I SGO NAS THA DAD, DNGOS PO MED 
NA KHYOD MED DGOS PA DE DNGOS PO DANG BDAG GCIG 'BREL GYI MTSAN NYID, MTSAN GZHI NI, BUM PA LTA BU,
Here is an actual application of the concept. The definition of what it is to
share a relationship with "working things" in such a way that to be a particular
thing is to automatically be a working thing is "something which is such that
to be it is by nature to be a working thing, but in such a way that they are
separate things; and where--if 'working things' were to cease to exist, then the
particular thing would have to cease to exist as well." A typical example here
would be a water pitcher.

DE BYUNG 'BREL GYI MTSAN NYID YOD DE, CHOS DE DANG RDZAS THA DAD PA'I SGO NAS CHOS DE'I 'BRAS BU'I RIGS SU GNAS PA, CHOS DE DANG DE BYUNG 'BREL GYI MTSAN NYID YIN PA'I PHYIR,
The definition of what it is to share a relationship with something else in such
a way that the first has come from the second is as follows:
Whenever two things are such that to be the first is to be the
kind of thing which is the result of the second, in such a way
that to be the first is not to be, by its very essence, the second.

MTSAN GZHI YOD DE, DNGOS PO'I PHYI LOGS SU BYUNG BA RNAMS DNGOS PO DANG DE BYUNG 'BREL YIN PA'I PHYIR,
A typical example would be the relationship of one coming from the other
between those things which are a working thing the moment after it, and the
original working thing.

RTAGS MA GRUB BO,
Here is the final part: eliminating our opponent's rebuttal. Suppose someone
comes and makes the following claim:
Consider the two of existence and non-existence.
So are these then two things which are discrete from one
another, and which are such that no one thing can
be both?
Because they are two things which are contradictory.
To this we answer, "The statement you gave as your reason is not correct."

,'DOD NA, YOD PA DANG MED PA GNYIS CHOS CAN, YOD PAR THAL, THA DAD YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Suppose you do agree [that the two of existence and non-existence were two
things which are both discrete from one another, and which are such
that no one thing can be both].
Consider the two of existence and non-existence.
Are they then something which exists?
Because they are discrete from one another.
_______________

KHA CIG NA RE, DU BA CHOS CAN, DE BYUNG 'BREL YIN PAR THAL, ME DANG DE BYUNG 'BREL YIN PA'I PHYIR ZER NA MA KHYAB,
Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
Consider smoke.
It is so then a relationship where one thing has come from
another,
Because it shares a relationship with fire such that it has
come from the other.
To this we answer, "It doesn't necessarily follow."

Formal logic subject:
Logical Statements Used to Prove an Absence of Something,
and the First Category of this Type of Statement
The following selection is from the monastic textbook entitled An Explanation of the
Art of Reasoning (rTags-rigs), also by the Tutor of His Holiness the Dalai Lama,
Purbuchok Jampa Tsultrim Gyatso.
_______________

`GSUM PA MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG BSHAD PA LA, MTSAN NYID, DBYE BA, MTSAN GZHI'I STENG DU MTSAN NYID NGES BYED KYI TSAD MA BSHAD PA DANG GSUM,
Here thirdly is our discussion of correct reasons of the type used to prove the
absence of something. We will proceed in three parts: the definition, an
explanation of the divisions, and a description of the valid perception where
we confirm that the definition applies to a typical example.

DANG PO NI, KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI RTAGS YANG DAG GANG ZHIG, KHYOD KYI RTAGS KYIS DE SGRUB KYI DNGOS KYI SGRUB BYA'I CHOS SU BZUNG BYA YANG YIN, DGAG PA YANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN SRID PA DE, KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG GI MTSAN NYID,
Here is the first. The definition of a correct reason used to prove the absence
of something in any particular proof is as follows:
Any reason which is (1) a correct reason for the particular proof;
and (2) such that there can exist one thing which is both (a) the
explicit version of the thing which is considered the quality to be
proven in the particular proof in which it acts as the reason, and
also (b) a negative thing.

GNYIS PA MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG LA DBYE NA, MI SNANG BA MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG DANG , SNANG RUNG MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG GNYIS,
Correct reasons to prove the absence of something can be divided into two
types: correct reasons for the absence of something involving a thing which is
imperceptible [to the particular opponent], and correct reasons for the absence
of something involving a thing which is perceptible [to the particular
opponent].

DANG PO NI, MDO LAS, GANG ZAG GIS GANG ZAG GI TSOD GZUNG BAR MI BYA STE, NYAMS PAR GYUR TE RE, ZHES RANG LA MI SNANG BA TZAM GYIS GZHAN LA YON TAN DE LTA BU MED CES 'CHAD MI RIGS PA'I DON STON PA LA, RNAM 'GREL LAS, TSAD MA RNAMS NI MI 'JUG PA, MED LA MI 'JUG 'BRAS BU CAN, ZHES SOGS KYIS BSTAN,
Here is the first. Now there is a sutra where it says,
No person should ever judge another; those who try will fall.
The point of these words is to show us how wrong it is for us to say that
someone else lacks any particular good quality, only because it does not appear
to us that they do. This same point is made in the Commentary with lines such
as the following:
In a case where valid perception has yet
To engage in the object, the result obtained
Is that they don't: they didn't engage.

DE SGRUB KYI MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG KYANG YIN, RANG NYID KYI RTAGS KYIS DE SGRUB KYI DGAG BYA'I CHOS SU BRTAGS PA'I DON DE SPYIR YOD KYANG , RANG NYID DE SGRUB KYI PHYOGS CHOS CAN DU SONG BA'I GANG ZAG GI TSAD MA LA MI SNANG BA DE, KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI MI SNANG BA MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG GI MTSAN NYID,
The definition of a correct reason used to prove the absence of something
involving a thing which is imperceptible in any particular proof is as follows:
Any reason which is first of all a correct reason used to prove the
absence of something for the particular proof, and which is
secondly such that--even though the thing which is considered
the main element of all which is denied by the proof in which it
serves as the reason does generally exist--this thing is
imperceptible to the valid perceptions of a person for whom this
same reason fulfills its role in the relationship between the subject
and the reason.

DE LA DBYE NA, DE SGRUB KYI MI SNANG BA'I 'BREL ZLA MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG 
DAG,DE SGRUB KYI MI SNANG BA'I 'GAL ZLA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG GNYIS,
This kind of reason can be further divided into two types: a correct reason
used to prove the absence of something in a particular proof, by virtue of the
absence of a corollary which possesses a relationship [with whatever is denied];
and a correct reason used to prove the absence of something in a particular
proof, by virtue of the presence of a corollary which is contradictory [to
whatever is denied].

MTSAN NYID RIM PA LTAR, KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI MI SNANG BA MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG KYANG YIN, MED DGAG KYANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN PA, DANG PO'I MTSAN NYID,
Here are the respective definitions. The first is defined as:
Anything which is first of all a correct reason in a particular
proof for the absence of something involving a thing which is
imperceptible, and which is secondly a negative in the sense of
being the absence of something.

DE SGRUB KYI MI SNANG BA MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG KYANG YIN, MA YIN DGAG DANG SGRUB PA GANG RUNG YANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN PA, GNYIS PA'I MTSAN NYID,
The second is defined as:
Anything which is first of all a correct reason in a particular
proof for the absence of something involving a thing which is

imperceptible, and which is secondly either a negative in the
sense of not being something, or a positive.

DANG PO LA DBYE NA, MI SNANG BA'I RGYU, KHYAB BYED, RANG BZHIN MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG GSUM,
The first of these can be divided into three types: those which are correct
reasons used to prove the absence of something which represent (1) a cause for
something involving a thing which is imperceptible; (2) a greater set than
something involving a thing which is imperceptible; and (3) a nature of
something involving a thing which is imperceptible.

Here are respective typical examples for the three. Suppose someone sets forth
the following logical statement:
Consider the place in front of us.
There cannot exist here, in the mental continuum of a
person for whom flesheater spirits [another word
for a preta, or tormented spirit] are still abstruse
objects, a recollection whose object corresponds to
reality, and which is used to ascertain the existence
of a flesheater spirit;
Because there does not exist, in the mental continuum of
this same person, any valid perception wherein he
or she perceives any flesheater spirit.
Think of this fact: that there does not exist, in the mental continuum of this
same person, any valid perception wherein he or she perceives any flesheater

spirit. This represents the first type of reason just listed--for proving the fact
that, in the place in front of us, there cannot exist, in the mental continuum of
a person for whom flesheater spirits are still abstruse objects, a recollection
whose object corresponds to reality, and which is used to ascertain the
existence of a flesheater spirit.

SHA ZA YOD PA LA BSKAL DON DU SONG BA'I GANG ZAG GIS SHA ZA YOD PA TSAD MAS MA DMIGS PA DE, MDUN GYI GZHI 'DIR SHA ZA BSKAL DON DU SONG BA'I GANG ZAG GIS SHA ZA YOD CES DAM BCA' MI RIGS PAR SGRUB PA'I GNYIS PA YIN,
Think now of the fact that a person for whom flesheater spirits are still
abstruse objects has not yet perceived, with a valid perception, the fact that
flesheater spirits exist. This represents the second type of reason just
listed--for proving the fact that, in the place in front of us, it would be
improper for a person for whom flesheater spirits are still abstruse objects to
swear that flesheater spirits do exist.

SHA ZA BSKAL DON DU SONG BA'I GANG ZAG GI RGYUD LA SHA ZA NGES BYED KYI DPYAD SHES DON MTHUN TSAD MAS MA DMIGS PA DE, MDUN GYI GZHI 'DIR DE 'DRA'I GANG ZAG GI RGYUD LA SHA ZA NGES BYED KYI DPYAD SHES DON MTHUN MED PAR SGRUB PA'I GSUM PA YIN,
Think finally of the fact that--in the mental continuum of a person for whom
flesheater spirits are still abstruse objects--there cannot be perceived, with any
valid perception, a recollection whose object corresponds to reality, and which
is used to ascertain the existence of a flesheater spirit. This represents the third
type of reason just listed--for proving the fact that, in the place in front of us,
there does not exist, in the mental continuum of just such a person, any
recollection whose object corresponds to reality, and which is used to ascertain
the existence of a flesheater spirit.

GANG GI SKYON YON RANG GI TSAD MAS MA NGES BZHIN DU SGRO BKUR BYAR MI RUNG BAR SHES PA'I CHED DU'O, ,
There is a specific purpose to these kinds of proofs. We are demonstrating
here that, if a person still doubted whether flesheater spirits existed (and if
they were thus still objects which were abstruse for them), then it would be
inappropriate for them to come to some definite conclusion in their own minds
about whether these spirits existed or not. We are meant by this example to
realize how inappropriate it is for us to either overestimate or underestimate
any particular person we may encounter, unable as we still are to
confirm--through a valid perception--whether or not they do in reality possess
a particular positive or negative personal quality.

DE SGRUB KYI DGAG BYA'I CHOS SU BTAGS PA'I DON YIN NA, DE SGRUB KYI DGAG BYA'I CHOS YIN PAS MA KHYAB STE, MDUN GYI GZHI 'DIR SHA ZA BSKAL DON DU SONG BA'I GANG ZAG GI RGYUD LA SHA ZA NGES BYED KYI DPYAD SHES DON MTHUN YOD PA DE DE 'DRA'I DPYAD SHES DON MTHUN MED PAR SGRUB PA'I DGAG BYA'I CHOS SU BTAGS PA'I DON DANG DE'I DGAG BYA'I CHOS GNYIS KA YIN GYI, SHA ZA DANG DE NGES PA'I DPYAD SHES DON MTHUN GNYIS RE RE NAS DE SGRUB KYI DGAG BYA'I CHOS SU BTAGS PA'I DON YIN KYANG DE'I DGAG BYA'I CHOS MA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
It is not necessarily the case, by the way, that if something is what we consider
the main element in all that we deny in a particular logical statement, then it
is also all that we deny in the same statement. Think of the possibility that
there did exist, in the mental continuum of a person for whom flesheater spirits
are still abstruse objects, a recollection whose object corresponds to reality, and
which is used to ascertain the existence of a flesheater spirit. This is both what
we consider the main element in all that we deny, and also all that we deny,
in a proof that there does not exist any such recollection whose object
corresponds to reality. The two of (1) flesheater spirits themselves, and (2)
states of recollection whose objects correspond to reality, and which are used
to ascertain the existence of such spirits, are--each of them separately--a kind
of case where something is what we consider the main element in all that we
deny in the particular logical statement, but not all that we deny in the
particular logical statement.

DANG PO SLA, PHYI MA MA GRUB NA, SHA ZA DANG DE NGES PA'I DPYAD SHES DON MTHUN GNYIS RE RE NAS DE SGRUB KYI DGAG BYA'I CHOS SU BTAGS PA'I DON YIN TE, DE SGRUB KYI PHYI RGOL YANG DAG DES MDUN GYI GZHI 'DIR SHA ZA YOD MED THE TSOM ZA BA'I PHYIR DANG , DES DE 'DRA BA'I DPYAD SHES DON MTHUN YOD MED THE TSOM ZA BA'I PHYIR,
The former example is easy. Suppose though that you say that the latter two
are incorrect.
Consider then (1) flesheater spirits themselves, and (2) states of recollection
whose objects correspond to reality, and which are used to ascertain the
existence of such spirits.
These are so--each one of them separately--things that we consider the main
element in all that we deny in the particular logical statement,
Because a correct opponent for this particular proof doubts whether or not
flesheater spirits exist in the place in front of us, and also doubts
whether or not there exists any such kind of recollection whose object
corresponds to reality.

Neither one of these is though, by itself, all that we deny in the particular
logical statement, because generally speaking there do exist flesheater spirits;
and because smoke is not all that we deny in a proof that there exists no
smoke upon the nighttime ocean.

YOD PA DE, MDUN GYI GZHI 'DIR SHA ZA BSKAL DON DU SONG BA'I GANG ZAG GI RGYUD LA SHA ZA NGES BYED KYI DPYAD SHES DON MTHUN MED PAR SGRUB PA'I MI SNANG BA'I 'GAL ZLA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG YIN NO, ,
Consider the fact that [the person described here] exists. This is an example
of a correct reason used to prove the absence of something in a particular
proof, by virtue of the presence of a corollary which is contradictory [to
whatever is denied], for proving that a person for whom flesheater spirits are
still abstruse objects still has no recollection which ascertains the existence of
such spirits, and whose object corresponds to reality.

Generally speaking, there are three different ways in which an object can be
abstruse, relative to your state of mind. These are objects which are abstruse
by virtue of the place, time, and nature. The first would be something like the
details of particular beings or realms which are situated at a great distance
from your particular location. The second would be something like the details
of events which have occurred or are going to occur at times which are eons
away in the past or future. These things are not abstruse in their own general
right, but only relative to a given state of mind. The third would be something
which is abstruse by virtue of being very subtle in nature, even though it may
exist in the immediate proximity. Examples of this would be things like a
flesheater spirit, or a being between death and rebirth who is headed towards
birth as a human or pleasure being, and their various heaps.
***************

The forms of debate:
Some Debating Tactics
The exquisite boxing style of Muhammed Ali showed the value of distracting
and harassing your opponet before even throwing a punch, and we use some
of the same tactics in a Buddhist debate. Again remember though, that the
goal is not to defeat your opponent, but to help him and yourself and the
audience listening; to sharpen his ability to concentrate under pressure, and to
raise challenging questions that will clarify everyone's understanding of the
life-saving Dharma.
Almost every normal debate begins with the attacker taking a mistaken
position, and this is perhaps the most important tactic of all. The greatest
geshes and debaters in the monastery have overcome any kind of pride, and
are fearless in taking a position which is mistaken--a position where they will
eventually have to "lose"--if this means that the defender and the audience will
learn some important point. The goal here is to take a position which is almost
correct, and very subtly mistaken: this will make for a fun debate, and clear up
this point for everyone.
Feigning is another common tactic in boxing and debate. Hutzpah is essential:
even if you're not sure your answer is correct, act like it is. Let the other
person prove you wrong logically, and you'll both learn something valuable.
Even if you can't hear the opponent's position clearly (which is a common
occurrence in the incredibly noisy debate grounds!), or you don't have much
clue of what he's talking about, take a shot! It starts a lively debate, which
sooner or later clarifies every detail of the issue. The point is: always work
from what you honestly think, answer to the best of your current
understanding, and don't be afraid to go on a journey with your opponent,
even through some dark or fuzzy places in your understanding, to reach to the
higher ground of knowledge.
Don't be afraid to use the audience to help you distract or disrupt your
opponent. Many an unbeatable position is overthrown in the monastery
simply by the (mistaken) boos of the audience, egged on by the attacker. Here
there are a whole repertoire of distracting taunts, which are fair game in the
rules of debate. We will list a few of them following--please note though that
the exact meaning of the words used has often been obscured over the
centuries; the meanings given here are sometimes "best guesses" offered to us
in an informal interview by the most qualified master in the world, Khen
Rinpoche Geshe Lobsang Tharchin.
One common taunt is Whoa! The attacker either feels or feigns great surprise
at a position taken by the defender, and begins a loud whoa sound. This is

picked up by the monks in the immediate vicinity who are following the
argument, and quickly spreads to the "deadheads" in the back (who are often
engaged in some conversation of their own and not listening) and even to
monks in other debate groups in the compound--all of whom have no idea
what the defender even said that he deserves a whoa! This whoa! generally
means "Uh-oh! Now you're in trouble!"
In the winter debates, the whoa can be followed by a loud chir! This is most
often used when an argument has been presented to a defender and he finds
himself unable to formulate an answer; it has the meaning of "Come on! We
want an answer!" A common corrolary in smaller groups is for the attacker
himself to say to a speechless defender, labda!--"Come on! Say something!"
Some people say that the chir! is che!--meaning "Your argument has stalled
now!" The spellings of these three in Tibetan are:

PHYIR, LAB DA, CHAD,
A screamed ha! has the same meaning as in English, "Wow! What a joke! Are
you kidding?" It is often accompanied by throwing your hands up in the air.
Tsa! is one of the most common taunts; it comes from the word ngo-tsa,
meaning "You should be ashamed to have said such a stupid thing!" and is
typically used when someone is forced to retract a position they have taken
themselves earlier. This is most often accompanied with a slap of the back of
one hand in the palm of another, with everything repeated a few times for
emphasis: Tsa! Ooooh tsa! Tsa chik! ("You should be ashamed! Ashamed, man!
What a disgrace!"). At this point a debater might scowl at his opponent and
jam his finger in his own cheek, meaning: "Time for you to blush, man!" Some
people say the tsa is the tsar in ngo-tsar, meaning, "Man! That was a weird
thing to say!" These words in Tibetan are:

TSA, NGO TSA, NGO MTSAR,
Two more taunts are more based in formal logic than in tactics. The first is
kyappa long, which literally means, "Give me your statement of necessity then!"
This is used in a context like the following, with the indented portion from the
opponent:
Consider sound.
It must so be a changing thing,
Because it's a thing which is made.
And that's true because anything which is made is always a changing thing.

SGRA CHOS CAN,
MI RTAG PA YIN PAR THAL,
BYAS PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
BYAS NA MI RTAG PA YIN PAS KHYAB PA'I PHYIR,
It's incorrect to say that.

RTAGS MA GRUB,
Give me your statement of necessity then!

KHYAB PA LONGS,
At this point, the opponent would be forced to give the following absurd
statement of necessity:
Just because something is a thing which is made doesn't prove
that it's a changing thing.

BYAS NA MI RTAG PA YIN PAS MA KHYAB,
A final rejoinder is korsum! or kordhi korsum! This means "You have just made
a circular argument," or "Now you have contradicted yourself completely!" A
typical case would be where the opponent accepts that sound is a made thing,
and accepts that if something is made it must be a changing thing, but
stubbornly asserts still that sound is an unchanging thing. In the second
version of this statement, the root syllable for the mantra of Gentle Voice
(Manjushri, or Jampel Yang) is interjected. The Tibetan spellings for these are:

'KHOR GSUM, 'KHOR DHA'I: 'KHOR GSUM,
Defenders have a few tactics of their own, one of the most useful being ah? or
la?--meaning "Whaddya say? I couldn't catch what you said." Then you put
your cupped palm up to your ear as if you're having a problem hearing the
attacker in all the mayhem of the debate ground. This is a great way to buy
a few extra moments while you formulate your answer!

Definitions and the Things They Define
The following reading consists of the Presentation of Definitions and the Things
They Define (mTsan-mtson gyi rnam-bzhag), from An Explanation of the
Elementary Path of Reasoning (Rigs-lam chung-gi rnam-par bshad-pa), by the
Master Tutor Purbuchok Jampa Tsultrim Gyatso (1825-1901), who in his day held the
position of Tutor to the Dalai Lama.

Here secondly is our own position. There is a definition of something defined,
because it is the following:
A case where all three of the nominal qualities are present.

There is a way of enumerating these three "nominal qualities," because the
following is a correct list of the three:

1) Generally speaking, the thing should be something to
be defined;
2) It should apply to some definitive example for it; and
3) It should be something defined only for whatever its
definition is, and not for any other.

MTSAN NYID KYI MTSAN NYID YOD DE, RDZAS YOD CHOS GSUM TSANG BA DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There is a definition of a definition, because it is the following:

There is a way of enumerating these three "material qualities," because the
following is a correct list of the three:
1) Generally speaking, the thing should be a definition;
2) It should apply to some definitive example for it; and
3) It should be a definition for nothing other than the
thing it defines.

DON BYED NUS PA'I MTSON BYA'I MTSAN NYID YOD DE, DON BYED NUS PA'I BTAGS YOD CHOS GSUM TSANG BA DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There does exist a definition of what "that which performs a function" defines,
because it is the following:
That case where all three of the nominal qualities pertaining to
"that which performs a function" are present.

DNGOS PO'I MTSAN NYID KYI MTSAN NYID YOD DE, DNGOS PO'I RDZAS YOD CHOS GSUM TSANG BA DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,

There does exist a definition for a definitive example where all three of the
nominal qualities for "that which performs a function" are present, because it
is the following:
That case of "that which performs a function" where all three of
the nominal qualities for "that which performs a function" are
present.

DE'I MTSAN GZHI YOD DE, DNGOS PO DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There is a definitive example of such a thing, because a working thing would
be one.

There is a way of enumerating these three qualities for being established as
something, because the following is a correct list of the three:
1) The thing should be something to be defined;
2) It should not be something defined for any other
definition than its definition; and
3) It should be possible with whatever we are considering
a definitive example.

MTSAN NYID KYI MTSAN NYID YOD DE, RNAM PAR 'JOG BYED CHOS GSUM TSANG BA DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There is also such a definition for a definition, for it is the following:

are present.

There is a way of enumerating these three qualities for establishing something,
because the following is a correct list of the three:
1) The thing should be a definition;
2) It should not be a definition for any object to be defined
other than the one it defines; and
3) It should be possible with whatever we are considering
a definitive example.

MTSAN GZHI'I MTSAN NYID YOD DE, MTSAN NYID KYI SKABS SU BAB PA'I MTSON BYA MTSON PA'I GZHIR GYUR PA DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,

We can illustrate these with a specific case. There is a definition for the object
defined by "that which performs a function," because it is the following:
A case where all three of the qualities for establishing something
through "that which performs a function" are present.

There is a way of enumerating these three qualities for being established as
something by "that which performs a function," because the following is a
correct list of the three:
1) The thing should be something to be defined by "that
which performs a function";
2) It should not be something defined for any other
definition than "that which performs a function";
and
3) It should be possible with whatever we are considering
a definitive example of the thing to be defined by
"that which performs a function."

DNGOS PO'I MTSAN NYID KYI MTSAN NYID YOD DE, DNGOS PO'I RNAM PAR 'JOG BYED CHOS GSUM TSANG BA DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There is a definition for the definition of a working thing, for it is the
following:

as a working thing are present.

DNGOS PO'I RNAM PAR 'JOG BYED KYI CHOS GSUM 'DREN TSUL YOD DE, DNGOS PO'I MTSAN NYID YIN PA, DNGOS PO LAS GZHAN PA'I CHOS GANG GI YANG MTSAN NYID MA YIN PA, DNGOS PO'I MTSAN NYID KYI MTSAN GZHIR GANG BZUNG BA LA SRID PA STE GSUM PO DE 'DREN RIGS PA'I PHYIR,
There is a way of enumerating these three qualities for establishing something
as a working thing, because the following is a correct list of the three:
1) The thing should be a definition for "working thing";
2) It should not be a definition for any object to be defined
other than "working thing"; and
3) It should be possible with whatever we are considering
a definitive example for the definition of a working
thing.

DNGOS PO'I MTSAN GZHI'I MTSAN NYID YOD DE, DON BYED NUS PAS DNGOS PO MTSON PA'I GZHIR GYUR PA DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There is also such a definition for a definitive example of a working thing,
because it is the following:
An example which typifies the working thing defined by "that
which performs a function."

MTSAN GZHI YOD DE, BUM PA DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There does exist a definitive example, since a water pitcher would be one.

SPYIR MTSAN NYID LA DBYE NA GNYIS YOD DE, RIGS MI MTHUN DANG , LOG RTOG SEL BA'I MTSAN NYID GNYIS YOD PA'I PHYIR,
Generally speaking, definitions may be divided into two types: (1) definitions
which disallow dissimilar types; and (2) definitions which disallow wrong
ideas.

DE GNYIS KA'I MTSAN GZHI YOD DE, GSAR DU MI SLU BA'I SHES PA GANG ZHIG, RTOG BRAL MA 'KHRUL BA'I SHES PA LTA BU DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
An example of both of these would be something like:
A state of mind which is (1) a fresh, unerring perception, and (2)
which is free of conceptualization and also unmistaken.

DE RIGS MI MTHUN SEL BA'I MTSAN NYID DANG , LOG RTOG SAL BA'I MTSAN NYID GNYIS KA YIN TE, RIGS MI MTHUN SEL BA'I MTSAN NYID YIN PA GANG ZHIG, LOG RTOG SEL BA'I MTSAN NYID YIN PA'I PHYIR,
This is a definition which is both kinds: one which disallows dissimilar types,
and one which disallows wrong ideas. And this is because it is (1) a definition
which disallows dissimilar types, and (2) a definition which disallows wrong
ideas.

DANG PO GRUB STE, MNGON SUM TSAD MA'I RIGS MI MTHUN LA TSAD MIN DANG RJES DPAG TSAD MA GNYIS SU NGES LA, TSAD MIN NI DE'I ZUR GYI GSAR DU MI BSLU BA ZHES PAS SEL NUS SHING , RJES DPAG TSAD MA NI DE'I ZUR GYI RTOG BRAL DANG MA 'KHRUL BA GANG RUNG RE RES SEL NUS PA'I PHYIR,
The first element mentioned is correct, because those states of mind which are
dissimilar to direct valid perception are limited to precisely two: perceptions
which are not valid, and deductive valid perceptions; while perceptions which
are not valid are disallowed by the part of the definition that says, "fresh,
unerring perception," and deductive perceptions are disallowed both by the
reference in the definition to "free of conceptualization" and also by the
reference to "unmistaken."

GNYIS PA GRUB STE, RTOG BRAL DANG MA 'KHRUL BA GANG RUNG RE RES RIGS MI MTHUN SEL KYANG , , RTOG BRAL DANG MA 'KHRUL BA GNYIS KA SMOS PA LOG RTOG SEL BA'I DBANG DU BYAS PA YIN LA, DE YANG ZLA GCIG ZLA GNYIS SU SNANG BA'I DBANG SHES LTA BU'ANG RTOG BRAL YIN PAS MNGON SUM YIN NAM SNYAM PA'I LOG RTOG SEL BA'I DBANG DU BYAS NAS MA 'KHRUL BA SMOS SHING , RIGS PA CAN PA SOGS MNGON SUM RTOG PAR 'DOD PA RNAMS KYI LOG RTOG SEL BA'I PHYIR DU RTOG BRAL SMOS PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
The second element mentioned is correct, because--although the references to
"free of conceptualization" and to "unmistaken" each by themselves disallow
dissimilar types--they each address a different wrong idea, and so both "free
of conceptualization" and "unmistaken" are mentioned, to disallow these wrong
ideas. Something like the sense perception where one moon appears to be two
is also a state of mind free of conceptualization, and so someone might wonder
whether it's a direct valid perception; and so the part about "unmistaken" is
added to disallow this wrong idea. The [non-Buddhist] Logician School (the
Nyayika) believe that direct perception is a kind of conceptualization; the part
about "free of conceptualization" is added to disallow their wrong idea.

Formal logic subject:
Reasons for the Absence of Something
Which Involve Something Perceptible
The following selection is taken from An Explanation of the Art of Reasoning
(rTags-rigs), also by the great tutor, Purbuchok Jampa Tsultrim Gyatso.

_______________

,SNANG RUNG MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG LA MTSAN NYID DBYE BA GNYIS,
There are two parts to our explanation of a correct reason for the absence of
something which involves something perceptible [to the opponent]: the
definition, and the divisions.

DANG PO NI, DE SGRUB KYI MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG KYANG YIN, DE SGRUB PA LA PHYOGS CHOS CAN DU SONG BA'I GANG ZAG LA DE SGRUB KYI DGAG BYA'I CHOS SU BRTAGS PA'I DON BSKAL DON MIN PA YANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN PA, DE'I MTSAN NYID,
Here is the first. The definition of a correct reason for the absence of
something which involves something perceptible is the following:
That thing which is both (1) a correct reason for the absence of
something in a particular proof; and (2) such that the thing which
is considered the main element of all which is denied by the
proof is not an abstruse object to the person for whom this same
reason fulfills its role in the relationship between the subject and
the reason.

DE LA DBYE NA, SNANG RUNG GI 'BREL ZLA MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG DANG , SNANG RUNG GI 'GAL ZLA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG GNYIS,
This type of reason may be divided into two types: a correct reason used to
prove the absence of something perceptible in a particular proof, by virtue of
the absence of a corollary which possesses a relationship [with whatever is
denied]; and a correct reason used to prove the absence of something
perceptible in a particular proof, by virtue of the presence of a corollary which
is contradictory [to whatever is denied].

MTSAN NYID RIM BZHIN, DE SGRUB KYI SNANG RUNG MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG KYANG YIN, MED DGAG KYANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN PA, DANG PO'I MTSAN NYID,
Here are the respective definitions of these two different types. The definition
of the first is:

That thing which is both (1) a correct reason used to prove the
absence of something perceptible in a particular proof and (2) a
negative thing in the sense of being an absence of something.

DE SGRUB KYI SNANG RUNG MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG KYANG YIN, MA YIN DGAG DANG SGRUB PA GANG RUNG YANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN PA, GNYIS PA'I MTSAN NYID,
The definition of the second is:
That thing which is both (1) a correct reason used to prove the
absence of something perceptible in a particular proof and (2)
either a negative thing in the sense of not being something, or a
positive thing.

DANG PO LA DBYE NA, SNANG RUNG GI RGYU, KHYAB BYED, RANG BZHIN, DNGOS 'BRAS MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG DANG BZHI,
The first may be divided into four different types: those reasons for the absence
of something where the reason involves a cause, a comprehensive set, a nature,
or an immediate result.

MTSAN NYID RIM PA LTAR, SNANG RUNG GI RGYU MA DMIGS PA'I TSUL GSUM YIN PA, DANG PO'I MTSAN NYID, DES 'OG MA RNAMS LA RIGS 'GRE,
Respective definitions of these four are as follows. The first is defined as "A
reason for the absence of something perceptible where the three relationships
hold, and where this reason represents a cause." This same pattern holds for
the other three.

MTSAN GZHI RIM PA LTAR, ME MED PA DE MTSAN MO'I RGYA MTSOR DU BA MED PAR SGRUB PA'I DANG PO DANG ,
Respective typical examples of the four are as follows. The first would be
"there is no fire there," used as a reason to prove that there is no smoke on the
surface of a [totally dark] nighttime ocean.

SHING MED PA DE, SHING TSAD MAS MA DMIGS PA'I BRAG RDZONG DU SHA PA MED PAR SGRUB PA'I GNYIS PA YIN,
An example of the second would be "there are no trees there," used as a reason
to prove that there are no juniper trees on the surface of a barren rock crag
where no trees can be perceived by a valid perception.

BUM PA TSAD MAS MA DMIGS PA DE, BUM PA TSAD MAS MA DMIGS PA'I SA PHYOGS SU BUM PA MED PAR SGRUB PA'I GSUM PA DANG ,
An example of the third would be "no water pitchers can be perceived there
by a valid perception," used as a reason to prove that there are no water
pitchers in a particular place where no water pitchers can be perceived with
a valid perception.

DNGOS 'BRAS DU BA MED PA DE, DU BAS DBEN PA'I RTZIG SKOR DU DU BA'I DNGOS RGYU MED PAR SGRUB PA'I BZHI PA YIN NO, ,
An example of the fourth would be "there is no smoke, its immediate result,
there"--used as a reason to prove that there the immediate cause of some
smoke does not exist atop a particular wall which is totally devoid of any
smoke.
***************
The forms of debate:
Different Types of Ceremonial Debates
The setting for debate in Tibetan Buddhism ranges from the intimate to highly
ceremonial debates before thousands of assembled monks. Walking around
Sera Mey Monastery at any given time of the day or night, you can hear the
sound of heated arguments and the slap of hands floating out of any window,
or from atop any of the flat roofs of most of the buildings, as friends or
classmates challenge each other in spontaneous debates that go wherever their
fancy takes them. Khen Rinpoche Geshe Lobsang Tharchin has often said that
the reason he attained the highest standing among the highest ranks of geshes
in the year he graduated was because of the constant exchange between him
and his roommate, the great geshe Jampel Sengge, who went on in later years

to become the teacher of Guiseppe Tucci, one of the greatest Tibetologists of
history.
Debate is often used in a private scripture class. Student monks in a Tibetan
monastery may visit the classes of different teachers throughout their career,
and choose the one who most fits their own needs. At any given time for the
sophomore class, for example, there may be three or four great teachers
instructing different groups of its members. Classes normally take place early
in the day--the teacher reads through a few pages of scripture with the
students, constantly throwing in pieces of debate about difficult questions. It
is very common for the teacher to take the role of the attacker, and then all the
students to yell back in unison, as a defender. Then by evening the students
are prepared to debate the topic of the day, having reviewed it themselves in
their own rooms during the afternoon.
As mentioned before, the first debate of the evening for any particular monk
in the geshe program is a "one-on-one" with another young monk, chosen by
wandering around the monastery debate park until you catch the eye of
someone you think might be good. (It feels much like a high-school dance!)
If the other monk is from a lower class, you get to review what you learned
before; if he's from a higher class, you get to explore something you will be
studying within a year or two.
Later on in the evening the monks bunch up into class groups, clustered
around a single attacker and one to three defenders. The subject here will
follow the readings of your class for the week, whether it be the perfection of
wisdom (prajnya paramita), middle-way philosophy (madhyamika), vowed ethics
(vinaya), logic (pramana), or higher knowledge (abhidharma).
Once a week, two entire classes challenge each other on a rotating basis, in a
debate called damcha (dam-bca'), a word which literally means "a position
taken." One class selects two of their best members to defend; and they come
first and seat themselves on a special platform at the head of the debate park.
These two will be the only defenders for the whole night, although their
classmates are allowed to shout out helpful answers, and jibes at the attackers
from the other class.
The attack begins with one of the senior members of the other class, who rises
and raises the first question. He continues to a certain point, often decided by
the debate master, when the next member of the class by seniority rises to pose
a different question. If the debate is particularly hot, other members of the
class leap up to throw in their own points, and before long there is a
wonderful scene of a whole row of students screaming great questions, often
in perfect unison. (It looks a little like a chorus line!)

This again is a great opportunity for the older class to review their knowledge,
while members of the younger class get to hear arguments inevitably referring
to the more advanced subject which the older class is on at the time. Damcha
debates can continue into the wee hours of the night, until the debate master
pulls the debaters off each other. Most of the monks wander home, while a
group of diehards might go on in a cluster in some corner of the debate park,
sometimes until dawn.
Two or three times a year, all monks in the geshe program are required to
attend a gyuktru (rgyugs-sprod) or "examination" debate. This is to test their
progress in their studies before a board made up of the abbot, the debate
master, and a number of senior geshes. Each monk will have an opportunity
both to defend on one question, and to attack on another. These debates are
very brief and heated, since each side knows they only have a few minutes to
demonstrate their ability before the debate master calls a truce and the next
pair begins (there are hundreds of students to get through in only a few days).
The question of who will qualify for the geshe and other degree examinations
is primarily based on the scores from these regular exams.
The degree examinations are the most critical and ritualized debates, and all
of them are also called damcha. The first major degree exam in a monk's career
is the rikchung examination; appearing for such an examination is known as
rikchung tsoklang. The meaning of the word rikchung (rigs-chung) is somewhat
uncertain, but Khen Rinpoche states that it probably refers to the level of a
student's ability in the science of reasoning (rigs-pa), which at this point (after
twelve or thirteen years of debating) is considered "lesser" (chung).
The expression tsoklang (tsogs-lang) most likely refers to the fact that the student
must stand up (lang) in the entire assembly of monks (tsok) from his own
monastery to defend his understanding. It also may ultimately be a corruption
of the expression tsulen (tsod-len), meaning to "judge the ability or capacity" of
the candidate's knowledge of the art of reasoning (rigs-pa'i tsod len).
A rikchung debate is rigorous, requiring many months of training by one's
teacher. Each candidate must prepare, with his teacher's help, a formalized
debate on a topic assigned by seniority--the "best" topics, such as compassion,
being awarded in advance to the best debaters. The opponent will be another
member of the class, and there are also large chunks of scripture to be
memorized for the required chanting section.
Practically the entire debate, down to whoa's and tsa's, must be memorized in
advance. Flowcharts are prepared showing all the possible appropriate
responses to every possible answer. The flowchart splits, and half becomes
totally useless, when the opponent during the actual debate answers, for

example, "wrong!" (tak ma drup) or "not necessarily!" (kyappa ma jung). After
the rough flowchart has been prepared by the candidate and his teacher, it is
handed over to a calligrapher, who prepares a huge banner with all possible
exchanges (even though the actual debate will ultimately only go down one
branch).
This banner is pasted to door of the candidate's room, where he can review it
frequently. He will also spend many months out in the cornfields, practicing
by himself, out of earshot of the opponent or his buddies (who are always
trying to find out in advance what issues he plans to raise).
Here he will also practice, over and over, every move of the entire debate: how
to bow to the abbot at the beginning; when to put on or remove the high,
peaked ritual hat; when to stand, when to sit; when to wave what arm; how
to wear the (incredibly heavy and hot) ritual robes and other accoutrements.
The rikchung debate is a very serious moment in a student monk's life; if he
fails to be among the small number of qualifying candidates (perhaps only 12
of the entire class), he will not be eligible for the geshe examinations much later.
After a successful rikchung debate there is usually a big party: mom and dad,
sister and brother, are usually down from other refugee camps in India to see
the big event; and the opponent, your teacher, and all your classmates show
up with gifts and silk scarves to help you celebrate.
The rikchen (chen meaning "greater" ability to reason) debate is the next big
step, and immediately precedes the geshe exams for higher ranks of geshes. It
is basically the same as the rikchung exam, except that it takes place in the
tsokchen (the great hall shared by the two monasteries involved, such as Sera
Mey and Sera Jey Monasteries), and the opponent comes from the sister
monastery. The audience now is not only all the monks of your monastery
(over a thousand now at Sera Mey, for example), but also all the monks of the
opponent's (Sera Jey, for example).
Both the rikchung and rikchen debates also call for a night of defending your
ability at your own college, or kangtsen (khang-tsan). Sera Mey, for example, is
divided into some twelve surviving colleges; and the one which ACI students
are affiliated with is that of our root lama, Khen Rinpoche Geshe Lobsang
Tharchin. This is Gyalrong College, home also to the illustrious Pabongka
Rinpoche. The kangtsen defense is mostly a dry-run among friends, to get the
student ready for the pressure of the other, larger debates to come.
The debates for a geshe candidate are, of course, the most rigorous. There are
many levels of geshe, and different kinds of geshes even among different
monasteries of the same tradition. A candidate for the lingse (gling-bsres) or

lower rank of geshe need only defend himself in the midst (se) of the
assembled monks of his own monastery (ling). Debates for this rank of geshe
are held about twice per year, and the number of candidates in each case is
typically restricted to two.
The lingse candidate first defends himself in open debate against each member
of his college, one-on-one, before the assembled college. The next step is a
defense before each member of every one of the classes in the geshe program,
which means every monk attending the debate park, each evening for about
a week. Finally comes a grand defense before the assembled monks of the
entire monastery, including all geshes and other monks who have graduated
from the debate park already. The other details of the lingse debate are similar
to the rikchung and rikchen debates, with a large amount of scripture to be
memorized and recited also.
The debates for the hlarampa or highest rank of geshe are much more difficult,
in the old days requiring an open defense before the assembled monks of every
one of the six major Gelukpa monasteries. The opponent here is another
highly qualified candidate selected by one of these other monasteries; normally,
only one or two candidates are "fielded" by each monastery per year.
The final debates between hlarampa (hla rams-pa) geshes occur during the great
prayer festival at the Tibetan new year; this was held in Lhasa (Hla-sa), and the
candidates had to have mastered a veritable myriad (rab-'byams, shortened to
rams) of scriptures. (This etymology comes from the Great Dictionary of the
Tibetan Language.) The most successful of the hlarampa debaters were awarded
"honors" (called anggi or "number') by His Holiness the Dalai Lama at the
Potala Palace--and our root lama, Khen Rinpoche, was awarded highest
honors in the year he completed his geshe.
In recent years, an extended series of intensive debate examinations before a
special board of abbots and their assistants, as well as written examinations,
have been added to the process, lengthening the entire wait of a candidate who
has already completed his class work, in some cases, up to eight or more years.
A final special form of debate is the Winter Debates, called Jang Gunchu, a sort
of annual Olympics between the great Gelukpa monasteries. Jang ('Jang) is the
name of a small monastery where these debates were held in Tibet, and gunchu
(dgun-chos) means "Dharma event held in the winter." In India, the debates are
sometimes mistakenly referred to as the Jamyang Gunchu ("Winter Debates of
Manjushri").
Traditionally, a small group of hand-picked students in the geshe
program--perhaps 50 from a monastery of thousands--was sent to Jang

Monastery to participate. The monks would prepare a backpack and sleeping
roll, and walk to the town of Jang, a good distance to the southwest of Lhasa.
The sponsoring monastery of the debate was Rato, known for its tradition of
masters of debate and logic. Here the monks would debate the very subjects
of this course series--logic and Buddhist perceptual theory--from the great
Commentary on Valid Perception of Master Dharmakirti. Special attention was
given to its most famous Tibetan commentary, an extraordinary masterpiece
by Gyaltsab Je, one of the principal disciples of Je Tsongkapa.
The Winter Debates would continue for an entire month, with nearly non-stop
debating on a personal, class, and inter-monastery level for the entire day
and--during special debates called tsenpe damcha--the entire night as well.
(According to Khen Rinpoche, the word tsenpe is a corruption of the word
tsenbu (mtsan-bud), meaning "all night long.")
The invasion of Tibet marked the end of the Winter Debates. After a long
hiatus, they were re-instituted in India, with the help of Khen Rinpoche and
his students. They are now back to their original glory, attended by hundreds
of the best young debaters and rotating each year between the "Big Three"
monasteries of Sera, Drepung, and Ganden. They provide an excellent
opportunity for the cream of the monasteries to get to know one another and
"cross-fertilize" their thinking, making the entire tradition stronger.

Here next is a presentation on the concept of exclusion. On this point,
someone may come and make the following claim:
If any one or number of the three kinds of exclusion exists for
something, then the exclusion for that thing always exists.

RI BONG RVA CHOS CAN, KHYOD KYI GZHAN SEL YOD PAR THAL, KHYOD KYI GZHAN SEL GSUM PO GANG RUNG YOD PA'I PHYIR, KHYAB PA KHAS,
Consider the horns of a rabbit.
Does an exclusion then exist for them?
Because any one or number of the three kinds of exclusion exist for them.
[It doesn't necessarily follow.]
But you already agreed that it does necessarily follow.

MA GRUB NA, RI BONG RVA CHOS CAN, KHYOD KYI GZHAN SEL GSUM PO GANG RUNG YOD PAR THAL, KHYOD KYI BLO'I GZHAN SEL YOD PA'I PHYIR,
[It's not correct to say that the there exist any one or number of the
three kinds of exclusion for the horns of a rabbit.]
Suppose you say that it's not correct.
Consider the horns of a rabbit.
Any one or number of the three kinds of exclusion does so exist for them,
Because there does exist the mental kind of exclusion for them.

MA GRUB NA, RI BONG RVA CHOS CAN, KHYOD KYI BLO'I GZHAN SEL YOD PAR THAL, KHYOD 'DZIN RTOG PA LA KHYOD MA YIN PA LAS LOG PAR SNANG BA DE KHYOD KYI BLO'I GZHAN SEL YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[It's not correct to say that the mental kind of exclusion exists for the
horns of a rabbit.]
Suppose you say that it's not correct.
Consider the horns of a rabbit.
The mental kind of exclusion does so exist for them,
Because the mental kind of exclusion for them is the image of the reverse of
all that is not them which appears to the conceptualization which grasps
to them.

MA GRUB NA, RI BONG RVA CHOS CAN, KHYOD 'DZIN RTOG PA LA KHYOD MA YIN PA LAS LOG PAR SNANG BA DE KHYOD KYI BLO'I GZHAN SEL YIN PAR THAL, BDAG MED YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[It's not correct to say that the mental kind of exclusion for the horns of
a rabbit is the image of the reverse of all that is not them which
appears to the conceptualization which grasps to them.]
Suppose you say that it's not correct.
Consider the horns of a rabbit.
The mental kind of exclusion for them is so the image of the reverse of all that
is not them which appears to the conceptualization which grasps to
them,
Because they are something that has no nature of its own.

RTZA BAR 'DOD NA, RI BONG RVA CHOS CAN, KHYOD KYI GZHAN SEL MED PAR THAL, KHYOD KYI DON RANG MTSAN GYI GZHAN SEL MED PA'I PHYIR, DER THAL, KHYOD DNGOS PO MA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[Then I agree to your original statement: an exclusion does exist for the
horns of a rabbit.]
Suppose you agree to our original statement.
Consider the horns of a rabbit.
It is not so, that an exclusion exists for them,
Because there exists for them no exclusion of the kind which is the
objectification of a specific instance;
And this is so true, because they are not a working thing.

KHA CIG NA RE, DNGOS PO YIN NA, DON RANG MTSAN GYI GZHAN SEL YIN PAS KHYAB ZER NA,
Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
If something is a working thing, then it is always an exclusion of
the kind which is the objectification of a specific instance.

BUM PA CHOS CAN, DON RANG MTSAN GYI GZHAN SEL YIN PAR THAL, DNGOS PO YIN PA'I PHYIR, KHYAB PA KHAS,
Consider a water pitcher.
So is it then an exclusion of the kind which is the objectification of a specific
instance?
Because it is a working thing.
[It doesn't necessarily follow.]
But you already agreed that it does necessarily follow.

'DOD NA, BUM PA CHOS CAN, GZHAN SEL YIN PAR THAL, DON RANG MTSAN GYI GZHAN SEL YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[Then I agree to your original statement: a water pitcher is an exclusion
of the kind which is the objectification of a specific instance.]
Suppose you agree to our original statement.
Consider a water pitcher.
So is it then an exclusion?
Because it is an exclusion of the kind which is the objectification of a specific
instance.

'DOD NA, BUM PA CHOS CAN, DGAG PA YIN PAR THAL, GZHAN SEL YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[I agree that a water pitcher is an exclusion.]
Suppose you do agree.
So is a water pitcher then a negative thing?
Because it is an exclusion.

MA KHYAB NA KHYAB PA YOD PAR THAL, GZHAN SEL DANG DGAG PA GNYIS DON GCIG YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[It doesn't necessarily follow.]
But it does necessarily follow,
Because "exclusion" and "negative thing" are terms that refer to the same thing.
 RTZA BAR 'DOD MI NUS TE, SGRUB PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[Then I agree to your original statement: a water pitcher is a negative
thing.]
But you can't agree to our original statement,
Because a water pitcher is a positive thing.

Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
The reverse of all that is not a water pitcher is, for a water

BUM PA MA YIN PA LAS LOG PA CHOS CAN, BUM PA'I DON RANG MTSAN GYI GZHAN SEL MA YIN PAR THAL, BUM PA'I DON RANG MTSAN GYI CHOS MA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Consider the reverse of all that is not a water pitcher.
It is not so true that it is, for a water pitcher, an exclusion of the kind which
is the objectification of a specific instance,
Because it is not that existing thing which represents the objectification of a
specific instance.

MA GRUB NA, BUM PA MA YIN PA LAS LOG PA CHOS CAN, BUM PA'I DON RANG MTSAN GYI CHOS MA YIN PAR THAL, RANG MTSAN GYI CHOS MA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[It's not correct to say that the reverse of all that is not a water pitcher

Suppose you say that it's not correct.
Consider the reverse of all that is not a water pitcher.
It is so true that it is not that existing thing which represents the objectification
of a specific instance,
Because it is not an existing object which represents the objectification of a
specific instance.

MA GRUB NA, BUM PA MA YIN PA LAS LOG PA CHOS CAN, DNGOS PO YIN PAR THAL, RANG MTSAN GYI CHOS YIN PA'I PHYIR, RTAGS KHAS,

is not an existing object which represents the objectification of a
specific instance.]
Suppose you say that it's not correct.
Consider the reverse of all that is not a water pitcher.
So is it then a working thing?
Because it is an existing object which represents the objectification of a specific
instance.
You already agreed to this reason.

MA KHYAB NA KHYAB PA YOD PAR THAL, RANG MTSAN GYI CHOS DANG DNGOS PO GNYIS DON GCIG YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[It doesn't necessarily follow that, just because something is an existing
object which represents objectification of a specific instance, it
must always be a working thing.]
But it does necessarily follow,
Because the terms "existing object which represents the objectification of a
specific instance" and "working thing" both refer to the same thing.

Suppose you agree to our original statement.
It is not so, that the reverse of all that is not a water pitcher is a working thing,
Because (1) all that is not all that is not a water pitcher is not a working thing,
and (2) there's no difference between this and the other.

Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
If there exists for something an exclusion of the kind which is the
objectification of a specific instance of the particular object, then
there must always exist the reverse of all that it is not.

KVA BUM GNYIS CHOS CAN, KHYOD MA YIN PA LAS LOG PA YOD PAR THAL, KHYOD KYI DON RANG MTSAN GYI GZHAN SEL YOD PA'I PHYIR, KHYAB PA KHAS,
Consider the two of a pillar and a water pitcher.
So does there exist the reverse of all that they are not?
Because there does exist for them an exclusion of the kind which is the
objectification of a specific instance.
[It doesn't necessarily follow.]
But you already agree that it does necessarily follow.

MA GRUB NA, KVA BUM GNYIS CHOS CAN, KHYOD KYI DON RANG MTSAN GYI GZHAN SEL YOD PAR THAL, KHYOD DON RANG MTSAN GYI CHOS YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[It's not correct to say that there does exist for the two .]
Suppose you say that it's not correct.
Consider the two of a pillar and a water pitcher.
There does so exist for them an exclusion of the kind which is the
objectification of a specific instance,
Because it would be the existing objects which are the objectification of a
specific instance of them.

RTZA BAR 'DOD NA, KVA BUM GNYIS CHOS CAN, KHYOD MA YIN PA LAS LOG PA MED PAR THAL, KHYOD YIN PA MI SRID PA'I SHES BYA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[Then I agree to your original statement: there does exist the reverse of

Suppose you agree to our original statement.
Consider the two of a pillar and a water pitcher.
It is not so true, that there does exist the reverse of all that a pillar and a water
pitcher is not,
Because they are a knowable thing which nothing can be.

Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:

Consider the two of a pillar and a pitcher.
There does not so exist for them an exclusion of the kind which is the
objectification of a specific instance,
Because (1) the two of a pillar and a pitcher is no such thing, and (2)
there exists no single such thing which would be distinct from
them.
Our answer to this would be, "The latter part of your statement is not correct."
And this is true because an example of such a thing would be the two of a
pillar and a pitcher which is devoid of being both an unchanging and
a changing thing.

KHA CIG NA RE, BUM PA'I DON RANG MTSAN GYI GZHAN SEL 'JOG PA'I TSE NA, RTAG DNGOS GNYIS KYIS STONG PA'I BUM PA DE 'JOG DGOS PA YIN ZER NA,
Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
Whenever you establish something as being, for a water pitcher,
an exclusion of the kind which is the objectification of a specific
instance, then you must establish a water pitcher which is devoid
of being both an unchanging and a changing thing.

But it's not so that this is the case,
Because it is allowable to establish the reverse of all that is not a water pitcher
as being, for a water pitcher, an exclusion of the kind which is the
objectification of a specific instance.

MA GRUB NA, DE CHOS CAN, BUM PA'I DON RANG MTSAN GYI GZHAN SEL YIN PAR THAL, BUM PA'I GZHAN SEL YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[It's not correct to say that it is allowable to establish the reverse of all

Suppose you say that it's not correct.
Consider this same thing.
It is so, for a water pitcher, an exclusion of the kind which is the objectification
of a specific instance,
Because it is, for the pitcher, an exclusion.

KHA CIG NA RE, BUM PA'I MED DGAG GI GZHAN SEL 'JOG PA'I TSE NA, BUM PA GANG ZAG GI BDAG MED DE 'JOG ZER NA,
Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
Whenever we establish something as being, for a water pitcher,
an exclusion of the kind which is a negative that involves the
absence of something, then we always establish, for a water
pitcher, the lack of any self-nature to the person.

DE MI 'THAD PA YIN PAR THAL, BUM PA LA BUM PA MA YIN PA MED PA DE BUM PA'I MED DGAG GI GZHAN SEL LA 'JOG DGOS PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
But this cannot be the case,
Because we must always establish the exclusion of the kind which is a negative
that involves the absence of something, with regard to a water pitcher,
as the condition that a water pitcher has nothing about it which is part
of all that is not a water pitcher.

DER THAL, BA LANG LA BA LANG MA YIN PA MED PA BA LANG GI MED DGAG GI GZHAN SEL LA 'JOG DGOS PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
And this is so the case,
Because we must establish the exclusion of the kind which is a negative that
involves the absence of something, with regard to a cow, as the
condition that a cow has nothing about it which is a part of all that is
not a cow.

DER THAL, TSAD CHEN LAS BSHAD PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
And this is so the case,
Because this is how the Great Book on Valid Perception explains it.

Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
It must be the case that the state of mind which is the reverse of
all that is not the state of mind is, for the state of mind, an
exclusion of the kind which is the objectification of a
specific instance,
Because (1) that water pitcher which is the reverse of all that is not the
water pitcher is, for a water pitcher, an exclusion of the kind
which is a specific instance of the water pitcher, and (2) the two
are similar cases.

'DOD NA, BLO MA YIN PA LAS LOG PA'I BLO CHOS CAN, BLO'I GZHAN SEL YIN PAR THAL, BLO'I DON RANG MTSAN GYI GZHAN SEL YIN PA'I PHYIR ZER NA MA KHYAB,
Suppose you agree to our statement.
Consider that state of mind which is the reverse of all that is not the state of
mind.
It must then be the mental kind of exclusion,
Because it is, for the state of mind, an exclusion of the kind which is the
objectification of a specific instance.
To this we answer, "It doesn't necessarily follow."

Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
Consider a state of mind.
That state of mind which is the reverse of all that it is not is so, for it,
an exclusion;
Because it is an existing thing which can be.
Our answer to this is, "We agree." And this is because, when you are
determining how to read this point, it is correct to read it in such a way that
you would answer "we agree" to the fact that the state of mind which is the
reverse of all that a state of mind is not would be an exclusion for that mind,
[and not a "mental kind of exclusion"].

On this particular point, someone might come and make the following claim:
That state of mind which is the reverse of all that is not
the state of mind is so a mental kind of exclusion,
Because that state of mind which is the reverse of all that
is not the state of mind is an exclusion for that state
of mind.
To this we answer, "It doesn't necessarily follow."
One could though never agree to the statement,
Because anything which is an exclusion for a state of mind is always an
unchanging thing.

Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
It is so true that that unchanging thing which is the reverse of all
that is not the unchanging thing is the exclusion for that
unchanging thing,
Because that water pitcher which is the reverse of all that
is not the water pitcher is exclusion for a water
pitcher.
Our answer to this is, "It doesn't necessarily follow."

'DOD NA, DE CHOS CAN, RTAG PA'I GZHAN SEL MA YIN PAR THAL, RTAG PA'I DON RANG MTSAN GYI GZHAN SEL MA YIN, RTAG PA'I MED DGAG GI GZHAN SEL YANG MA YIN, RTAG PA'I BLO'I GZHAN SEL YANG MA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
And suppose you agree to that statement.
Consider that unchanging thing which is the reverse of all that is not the
unchanging thing.
It is not so true, that it is the exclusion for that unchanging thing,
Because it is neither the type of exclusion which is a specific instance of the
unchanging thing; nor the type of exclusion for the unchanging thing
which is a negative that involves the absence of something; nor the
mental type of exclusion.

RTAGS DANG PO MA GRUB NA, DE CHOS CAN, RTAG PA'I DON RANG MTSAN GYI GZHAN SEL MA YIN PAR THAL, GANG ZAG GI BDAG MED YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[The first part of your reason is not correct: it's not correct to say that an
unchanging thing which is the reverse of all that is not an
unchanging thing is not the type of exclusion which is a specific
instance of the unchanging thing.]

Suppose you say that the first part of our reason is not correct.
Consider this same thing.
It is not so true, that it is the type of exclusion which is a specific instance of
the unchanging thing,
Because it is one example of the lack of any self-nature of the person.

Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
Consider unproduced, empty space.
It is so true, that it is the type of exclusion which is a specific instance
of a negative thing which involves the absence of something,
Because it is a type of exclusion which is a negative that involves the
absence of something.
To this we answer, "It doesn't necessarily follow."
[Please note that this text uses the above unusual spelling for "unproduced" several
times, so we have left it as is.]

Suppose someone else, in response to this exchange, comes and makes the
following claim:
Consider a negative thing which involves an absence.
It is so true, that anything which is an exclusion for it is that type of
exclusion which is a specific instance for it,
Because there does exist an exclusion for it.

RTAGS MA GRUB PA YIN TE, BRTZI BA'I TSE NA MED DGAG DE'I GZHAN SEL YOD PAR RTAGS MA GRUB CES RTZI DGOS PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
To this we answer, "It's not correct to say that." And this is because, when you
read this statement, you would have to read it as "there does exist an exclusion
for this particular negative involving an absence," and would therefore have to
answer, "It's not correct to say that."
_______________

KHA CIG NA RE, 'DU MA BYAS KYI NAM MKHA' DE MED DGAG GI GZHAN SEL MIN ZER NA,
Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:

'DU MA BYAS KYI NAM MKHA' CHOS CAN, MED DGAG GI GZHAN SEL YIN PAR THAL, MED DGAG YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Consider unproduced, empty space.
It is so an exclusion which is a negative thing that involves the absence of

Because it is a negative thing which involves the absence of something.

MA KHYAB NA KHYAB PA YOD PAR THAL, MED DGAG GI GZHAN SEL DANG MED DGAG GNYIS DON GCIG YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[It doesn't necessarily follow.]
But it does necessarily follow,
Because "an exclusion which is a negative thing that involves the absence of

something" both refer to the same thing.
_______________

RANG GI LUGS LA, GZHAN SEL DANG DGAG PA GNYIS DON GCIG YIN PAS MTSAN NYID 'JOG MI DGOS,
Here secondly is our own position. Because the terms "exclusion" and
"negative thing" refer to the same thing, there is no need to posit a definition
for exclusion.

DNGOS PO YIN NA KHYOD KYI DON RANG MTSAN GYI GZHAN SEL YOD PAS KHYAB LA, DNGOS POR GYUR PA'I DGAG PA DANG DON RANG MTSAN GYI GZHAN SEL GNYIS DON 
If something is a working thing, then there always exists an exclusion for it
which is the objectification of a specific instance. The terms "negative thing
which is a working thing" and "an exclusion which is the objectification of a
specific instance" both refer to the same thing.

GCIGBDG MED YIN NA KHYOD KYI BLO'I GZHAN SEL YOD PAS KHYAB LA, BLO'I GZHAN SEL DANG RTOG PA'I SNANG YUL GNYIS DON 
There is always a mental kind of exclusion for anything which is such that it
possesses no nature of its own. The terms "mental kind of exclusion" and
"object which appears to a conceptualization" refer to the same thing.

GCIGGZHI GRUB NA KHYOD KYI MED DGAG GI GZHAN SEL YOD PAS KHYAB LA, MED DGAG GI GZHAN SEL DANG MED DGAG GNYIS DON GCIG YIN NO, ,
If a thing can be established as existing, then there is always an exclusion of
it which is a negative thing that involves the absence of something. And the
terms "exclusion which is a negative thing that involves the absence of
something" and "negative thing which involves the absence of something" refer
to the same thing.

Formal logic subject:
Identifying Elements of a Logical Statement,
and Some Different Classifications of Correct Logical Statements
The following selection is taken from An Explanation of the Art of Reasoning
(rTags-rigs), composed by the great tutor of His Holiness the Thirteenth Dalai Lama
named Purbuchok Jampa Tsultrim Gyatso (1825-1901).

RTAGS CHOS DON GSUM NGOS BZUNG BA LA, DAM BCA' BZHAG PA DANG , SGRUB BYED 'GOD PA GNYIS DANG PO NI,
This bring us to the section where we identify the reason, the quality to be
proven, and the subject. We proceed in two steps: presenting our position, and
then putting forth proofs to support our position. Here is the first.

ME MED PA DE, ME MED PA'I RTAGS KYIS MTSAN MO'I RGYA MTSOR DU BA MED PAR SGRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS YIN, ME MED DE DE'I RTAGS KYIS DE SGRUB KYI GTAN TSIG MA YIN,
The expression "because there is no fire" is a logical reason for proving that
there is no smoke on the surface of an ocean in the middle of the night in a
proof where "because there is no fire" serves as the reason in the proof.
"Because there's no fire" is not a logical reason for the same proof where that
same term serves as the reason in the proof.

DU BA MED PA DE, ME MED PA'I RTAGS KYIS DE SGRUB KYI SGRUB BYA'I CHOS DANG , DE SGRUB KYI DNGOS KYI SGRUB BYA'I CHOS SU BZUNG BYA GNYIS KA YIN, DU MED DE DE GNYIS KA MA YIN, DES SHING MED SOGS LA RIGS 'DRE'O, ,
The expression "there is no smoke" is both (1) the quality to be proven in that
same proof, where "because there is no fire" serves as the reason; and (2) that
which is considered the explicit form of the quality to be proven for the same
proof. The expression "it's smokeless" is neither of the two. This same pattern
applies for the expressions such as "there are no trees" and so on.

The expression "because there is no water pitcher perceived to be there by any
valid perception" is a logical reason for proving that there exists no water
pitcher in a particular location where no water pitcher is perceived by any
valid perception to be present. The expression "there exists no water pitcher
there" is both (1) the explicit form of the quality to be proven in the same
proof, where "because there is no water pitcher perceived to be there by any
valid perception" is acting as the reason; and (2) that which is considered the
explicit form of the quality to be proven in the same proof. This pattern
follows for other cases as well.

A "flesheater spirit" [a preta, or tormented spirit] is a main element in the

Here next is the second major point from above. Correct reasons may also be
classified according to the quality to be proven. Here there are two types:
correct positive reasons, and correct negative reasons.

Here are their respective definitions. First comes the definition of a correct
positive reason for any particular proof:
Something which is (1) a correct reason for a particular proof;
and (2) which is such that there can exist one thing which is both
(a) the object which is considered the explicit form of the quality
to be proven in the proof where it acts as the reason, and (b) a
positive thing.

DE LA DBYE NA, 'BRAS RTAGS YANG DAG DANG , RANG BZHIN GYI RTAGS YANG DAG GNYIS YOD, DE GNYIS GANG RUNG YIN NA, SGRUB RTAGS YANG DAG YIN PAS KHYAB,
These kinds of reasons may be divided into two types of their own: correct
reasons that involve a result, and correct reasons that involve a nature.
Anything which is one of these two types of reasons is always a positive
reason.

KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI RTAGS YANG DAG GANG ZHIG, KHYOD KYI RTAGS KYIS DE SGRUB KYI DNGOS KYI BSGRUB BYA'I CHOS SU BZUNG BYA YANG YIN DGAG PA YANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN SRID PA, KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI DGAG RTAGS YANG DAG YIN PA'I MTSAN NYID,
The definition of a correct negative reason for any particular proof is as
follows:
Something which is (1) a correcct reason for a particular proof;
and (2) which is such that there can exist one thing which is both
(a) the object which is considered the explicit form of the quality
to be proven in the proof where it acts as the reason, and (b) a
negative thing.

DGAG RTAGS YANG DAG DANG , MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG GNYIS DON 
The terms "correct negative reason" and "correct reason for proving the absence
of something" both refer to the same thing.

It is contradictory for one thing to be both a correct negative reason for a
particular proof and also a correct positive reason for the same proof. It is not
contradictory though for one thing to be both a correct negative reason and a
correct positive reason. And this is because the expression "a thing which is
made" can be both: it is both a correct negative reason for proving that sound
is not an unchanging thing, and it is a correct positive reason for proving that
sound is a changing thing.

Next is the third major point from above. Correct reasons may also be
classified by according to how the proof is made. Here there are five different
types:
1) Correct reasons for proving the meaning;
2) Correct reasons for proving the term;
3) Correct reasons for proving the meaning alone;
4) Correct reasons for proving the term alone; and
5) Correct reasons for proving both the meaning and the term.
We will discuss these reasons in three parts: their definition, typicial example,
and supporting logic.

Here first is the definition of a correct reason for proving the meaning in any
particular proof:
Something which is both (1) a correct reason for a particular
proof; and (2) which is such that there can exist one thing which
is both (a) the explicit form of the thing considered the quality to
be proven for the particular proof in which it serves as the
reason, and (b) a definition.

The definition of a correct reason for proving the term in any particular proof
is as follows:
Something which is both (1) the same as the first part above; and
(2) which is such that there can exist one thing which is both (a)
the explicit form of the thing considered the quality to be proven
for the particular proof in which it serves as the reason, and (b)
something which is defined.

The definition of a correct reason for proving the meaning alone in any
particular proof is as follows:

Something which is both (1) the same as the first part above; and
(2) which is such that there cannot exist one thing which is both
(a) the explicit form of the thing considered the quality to be
proven for the particular proof in which it serves as the reason,
and (b) something which is a thing defined--but which is though
such that there can exist one thing which is both (a) the same as
part "a" above and (b) something which is a definition.

The definition of a correct reason for proving the term alone in any particular
proof is as follows:
Something which is both (1) the same as the first part above; and
(2) which is such that there cannot exist one thing which is both
(a) the explicit form of the thing considered the quality to be
proven for the particular proof in which it serves as the reason,
and (b) something which is a definition--but which is though
such that there can exist one thing which is both (a) the same as

The definition of a correct reason for proving both the meaning and the term
in any particular proof is as follows:
Something which is both (1) the same as the first part above; and
(2) which is such that there can exist one thing which is both (a)
the explicit form of the thing considered the quality to be proven

for the particular proof in which it serves as the reason, and (b)
something which is a definition--and there can also exist one
thing which is both (a) the same as part "a" above and (b)
something which is a thing defined.

"Something which only lasts a moment" is a correct reason for proving the
term alone in a proof that sound is a changing thing; but it is not a correct
reason in the same proof where "something which is made" is used as the
reason. This is because, if something is a correct reason for this specific proof,
it must be one and the same as "something which is made."

"Something which is made" is a correct reason for proving the term alone in
a proof that sound is a changing thing, when this proof is presented to a
correct opponent who has already established, through a valid perception, that
sound is a thing that only lasts a moment. Generally speaking though it is a
correct reason for proving both the meaning and the term. This is because it
is--when presented to an opponent who has not yet ascertained, through any
valid perception, that sound is a thing that only lasts a moment--a correct
reason for proving both the meaning and the term.

This brings us to the fourth major point, which is classifying correct reasons by
the assertion to be proven. Here there are three different types: correct reasons
involving deduction; correct reasons involving reasoned belief; and correct
reasons involving convention.

DE SGRUB KYI RTAGS YANG DAG GANG ZHIG, DE SGRUB KYI BSGRUB BYA LA DNGOS STOBS KYI RJES DPAG TSAD MA SKYED BYED DE, DANG PO'I MTSAN NYID,
The definition of the first is as follows:
Something which (1) a correct reason for the particular proof; and
which (2) serves to produce a deductive type of valid perception
towards the assertion of the particular reason.

DE GANG ZHIG, DE SGRUB KYI BSGRUB BYA LA YID CHES KYI RJES DPAG TSAD MA BSKYED BYED DE, GNYIS PA'I MTSAN NYID,
The definition of the second is:
Something which (1) a correct reason for the particular proof; and
which (2) serves to produce a valid perception of the type which
involves reasoned belief, towards the assertion of the particular
reason.

DE GANG ZHIG, , DE SGRUB KYI BSGRUB BYA LA GRAGS PA'I RJES DPAG TSAD MA BSKYED BYED DE, GSUM PA'I MTSAN NYID,
The definition of the third is:
Something which (1) a correct reason for the particular proof; and
which (2) serves to produce a valid perception of the type which
involves convention, towards the assertion of the particular
reason.

The first of these may be divided further into three types: correct reasons
which involve a result, a nature, and the absence of something. Respective
typical examples would be the following.
1) "Because there is smoke," a correct reason which involves deduction
and is of the result type, for proving that fire exists in a smoky
mountain pass;
2) "Because it is a thing which is made," a correct reason which involves
deduction and is of the nature type, for proving that sound is a
changing thing; and
3) "Because there is no fire there," a correct reason which involves
deduction and is of the type relating to the absence of something,
for proving that there is no smoke upon the surface of the
nighttime ocean.

There are also these same three types for the second kind here: those which
involve a result, a nature, and the absence of something. Examples here would
be:

1) "Because it is scriptural authority which has withstood the three
tests," a correct reason which involves reasoned belief and is of
the result type, for proving that the citation "Giving leads to
possessions, and morality to happiness" is scriptural authority
which is such that the person who spoke it possessed, before he
spoke, a valid perception in which he or she realized the truth of
what the citation expresses;
2) The same reason, as a correct reason which involves reasoned belief
and is of the kind which relates to a nature, for proving that the
same citation is unerring about what it expresses; and
3) The same reason, as a correct reason which involves reasoned belief
and is of the kind which relates to the absence of something, for
proving that the same citation is not erring about what it
expresses.
[The "three tests," by the way, are:
1) We have confirmed, with our own direct valid perceptions, those parts of the
statement which correspond to "evident" reality;
2) We have confirmed, with our own logical, deductive form of valid
perception, those parts of the statement which correspond to "hidden"
reality; and
3) We have established that those parts of the statement which correspond to
"deeply hidden" reality are free of any internal contradiction or similar
faults.]

There are, finally, two types for the third kind here. "Because that's how
people think," is an example of a correct reason which involves convention and
which relates to a nature, to prove that it is nominally appropriate to speak of
the moon as the "house of the rabbit." The same expression, "Because that's
how people think," is also an example of a correct reason which involves

convention and which relates to the absence of something, to prove that it is
not literally appropriate to speak of the moon as the "house of the rabbit."

The fifth point is the classification of correct reasons according to how they
relate to the group of similar cases. Here there are two types: correct reasons
where the set of similar cases and the reason subsume each other; and correct
reasons where they relate to each other in two dissimilar ways, [subsuming in
one direction, but not in the other].

SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I MTHUN PHYOGS LA KHYAB BYED DU 'JUG PA'I TSUL GSUM YIN PA, DE SGRUB KYI DANG PO'I MTSAN NYID,
The definition of the first in a proof that sound is a changing thing is:
A reason where the three relationships hold, and where it and
the group of similar cases in that particular proof subsume each
other.

DE LA RNAM GNYIS SU 'JUG PA'I TSUL GSUM YIN PA, DE SGRUB KYI GNYIS PA'I MTSAN NYID,
The definition of the second in the same proof is:

the group of similar cases in that particular proof relate to each
other in two dissimilar ways.

BYAS PA DANG PO'I MTSAN GZHI DANG , BYAS PA'I BYE BRAG GNYIS PA'I MTSAN GZHI YIN,

The sixth and final division here is that critical one where the classification is
made by correct opponent. Here there are two types: correct reasons to use in
the context of oneself, and correct reasons to use in the context of others.

Whenever the proponent seeks to establish something to his own mind, setting
forth "because it's a made thing" to himself in order to prove that sound is a

to use in the context of oneself, to prove that sound is a changing thing.

But this is incorrect,
Because in a case where "because it's a made thing" has actually been

[It's not correct to say that there does exist a correct reason to use in the

Suppose you say that it's not correct.
Consider knowable things.
So is it then the case that, whenever anything is a correct reason for proving
that sound is a changing thing, it can never be a correct reason, to use
in the context of oneself, in order to prove that sound is a changing
thing?
Because you said it was not correct.

Consider "because it's a made thing," in a case where "because it's a made

context of oneself, for proving that sound is a changing thing.
So is it then not a correct reason to use in the context of oneself for this same
proof?
Because it is a correct reason for this same proof.
Now all you can do is contradict yourself.

Moreover, isn't it so that "because it's a made thing" cannot be a correct reason

Because isn't it a correct reason to use, in the context of others, to prove the
same thing?
And isn't this the case, because the logical statement given immediately below
is a correct logical statement involving a correct reason to use in the

Consider sound.
It is a changing thing,

On this point, someone may come and make the following claim:
So is it then true that--in a case where there is no correct
opponent for a proof where "because it's a made thing" is
used as a reason to prove that sound is a changing
thing--there is in fact a correct opponent for a proof
where "because it's a made thing" is used as a reason to
prove that sound is a changing thing?
Because--in a case where "because it's a made thing" has
actually been employed as a correct reason to use,
in the context of oneself, for proving that sound is
a changing thing--"because it's a made thing" is a
correct reason to use, in the context of others, for
proving that sound is a changing thing.
To this we answer, "Your reason is not correct."

And suppose one did agree to your original statement.
So is it then the case that, where there is not something made, there is
something made?
Because it is the case that--where there is no correct opponent for a proof in
which "because it's a made thing" is used as a reason to prove that
sound is a changing thing--there is in fact a correct opponent for a
proof where "because it's a made thing" is used as a reason to prove that
sound is a changing thing.
And you've already agreed that this reason is correct.

Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
It is true that there does not exist any correct reason to use in the
context of oneself. Nonetheless, "because it's a made thing" is a
correct reason to use, in the context of oneself, to prove that
sound is a changing thing--in a case where "because it's a made
thing" has actually been employed as a correct reason to use, in
the context of oneself, for proving that sound is a changing thing.

MI 'THAD DE, RANG DON SKABS KYI RTAGS YANG DAG YOD PAR THAL, SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I RANG DON SKABS KYI RTAGS YANG DAG YOD PA'I PHYIR,
But this is incorrect,
Because there must then exist a correct reason to use in the context of oneself;
Because there does exist a correct reason to use, in the context of oneself, for
proving that sound is a changing thing.

BYAS PA SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I RANG DON SKABS KYI RTAGS YANG DAG TU SONG BA'I TSE, BYAS PA YOD PA GANG ZHIG, DE'I TSE BYAS PA SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I RANG DON SKABS KYI RTAGS YANG DAG YOD PA'I PHYIR, RTAGS KHAS,
And this is true because--in an instance where "because it's a made thing" has
actually been employed as a correct reason to use, in the context of
oneself, for proving that sound is a changing thing--it is the case that
(1) a made thing actually does exist, and (2) there does exist in this
instance a correct reason to use, in the context of oneself, where
"because it's a made thing" is employed to prove that sound is a
changing thing.
You've already agreed that the reason is correct.

It is moreover true that there does exist a correct reason to use, in the context
of oneself, to prove that sound is a changing thing;
Because there is an instance where "because it's a made thing" has actually
been employed as a correct reason to use, in the context of oneself, for
proving that sound is a changing thing.

And this is true because there is a person for whom "because it's a made thing"
has actually been employed as a correct reason to use, in the context of
oneself, for this particular proof;
And this is true because there is a person for whom "because there is smoke
there" has actually been employed as a correct reason to use, in the
context of oneself, for proving that there is fire in a smoky mountain
pass.

There is also the logical proof that we use to establish the existence of past and
future lives:
Consider the mind of a common person [one who has not
yet seen emptiness directly] who is just about to
die.
There does exist, as its material result, a later state of
mind;
Because it is a state of mind present in the being of a
person who still possesses ignorant desire.
It is, for example, similar to the present state of mind.

And consider the mind of an infant who has just been
born.
A mind which is of exactly the same type as it has
preceded it,
Because it is a state of mind.
It is, for example, like the mind of a very old person.

The forms of debate:
The Traditional Debating Classes and Subjects
Over the centuries, each major Gelukpa monastery in Tibet has developed its
own unique curriculum, all based on the study of the five great books of
ancient Indian Buddhism. The structure of the different classes in the debate
park is designed around the progressive study of a student in the geshe
program through these five great classics, and this is where the core subjects
and even the name of the Asian Classics Institute come from.
There are fourteen different debate classes going on simultaneously at Sera
Mey Tibetan Monastery, and typically 20 to 22 years is required to pass
through the fourteen. Each of the classes has its own special name--something
like "freshman" or "sophomore" in the West. At any given night in the debate
park, the classes will be huddled in different spots spread around the park.
The best spots (under a couple of especially shady trees in the summer, or up
against a protecting wall in windy, cold weather) are given to the higher
classes. If a beginning class is very large, the debate master may choose to
break it up for the night into two or even three separate groups. Each group
starts out with a single attacker and, normally, two defenders; by the end of
the night, this may have dissolved into melee of eight or ten attackers bearing
down on the original two defenders, with a group of supporters huddled
behind them shouting out answers too.
Typical classes at present in Sera Mey might start out with sixty or seventy
young men, of whom only a handful--four or five--will actually make it to the
end of the geshe program. There is a custom at an advanced point in the

curriculum, around ten years into the program, to combine two of the classes
from that point on, so that there are enough monks left to make the debates
interesting.
The following is a list of the names, durations, and traditional subjects for each
of the debate classes at Sera Mey. It was compiled with the help of Khen
Rinpoche Geshe Lobsang Tharchin. It should be noted that this is the ideal
curriculum, and in the refugee monasteries of southern India events like an
unusually long monsoon season, an attack of tuberculosis, sudden changes of
plan by monastic officials, extra monastic ceremonies to be attended, a public
teaching by a great visiting Lama, or any number of other happenings can
conspire to lengthen or shorten the time needed to complete one's geshe
studies.
Year One
Class One: Beginning Class, Collected Topics
This class is Tibetan is known as duchung (bsdus-chung), since it is a beginning
(chung) class on the collected topics (bsdus-grva) of Buddhist logic and
perceptual theory, mostly according to the "Sutrist" (Sautrantika or mDo-sde-pa)
School, which is considered the second of the four schools of ancient India. It
is also the higher of the two schools of the Lower Way (Hinayana).
The original root text for this class is the Commentary on Valid Perception
(Pramana Varttika, Tsad-ma rnam-'grel), written by Master Dharmakirti (sLob-
dpon Chos-kyi grags-pa) around 650 AD. The principal monastic textbook is the
Collected Topics (Yongs-'dzin bsdus-grva) of the Master Tutor, Purbuchok Jampa
Tsultrim Gyatso (1825-1901).
The duration of the class is one year, and begins with a special ceremony of
initiation into the debate park. The students are typically around 14 or 15
years old; they have completed some elementary study of the collected topics
with their house teacher, and are already familiar with the format of debate
(called rikpay grotang [rigs-pa'i 'gro-stangs]). These students have also already
learned to read and write (in both the regular and cursive alphabets), and have
memorized many of the shorter prayers and texts.
In a pattern which will continue throughout their careers as students in the
geshe program, the class moves through a standard series of topics, each with
its own name--such as chokchu (phyogs-chos): the study of the subject element
in a logical statement, and its relationship to the reason. The class might
remain on a particular topic for say one to six weeks, and then move on to the
next, according to an undefined, organic schedule dependent on a constant

assessment of their progress by the great lamas who are instructing different
members of the class.
In the curriculum of the Asian Classics Institute, the topics of this and the next
class are represented in the following courses:
Course XIII: The Art of Reasoning
Extension Course 3: Mind and Mental Functions
Year Two
Class Two: Advanced Class, Collected Topics
This class is a continuation of the previous, and lasts for a year. Its name is
duchen (bsdus-chen), meaning the advanced (chen-po) class on the collected topics
(bsdus-grva).
Year Three
Class Three: Beginning Class, First Chapter of the "Ornament"
The name of this class in Tibetan is shungsar (gzhung-gsar), indicating that these
students are beginners (gsar-pa) in the first of the great classics (gzhung). The
foundation root text here is the Ornament of Realizations (Abhisamaya Alamkara),
dictated to the realized being Asanga ('Phags-pa Thogs-med) by the future
Buddha, Maitreya (rJe-btzun Byams-pa) around 350 AD. The principal monastic
textbook for this class is the Analysis of the Perfection of Wisdom (Phar-phyin
mtha'-dpyod) by Kedrup Tenpa Dargye (mKhas-grub bsTan-pa dar-rgyas), a
master from Sera Mey who lived 1493-1568.
These texts present the beliefs of the lower Middle-Way school (the lower half
of the fourth or highest school of the four, which itself corresponds to the
higher of the two schools of the Mahayana, or Greater Way). This school is
known as the Madhyamika Svatantrika (dBu-ma rang-rgyud pa), or "Independent"
branch of the Middle-Way, so named because of their belief that we must take
an independent object and discuss it in common terms to bring another person
to understand correct view. The entire study of this school is called, in the
monastery, the "Perfection of Wisdom," or parchin (phar-phyin) in Tibetan--an
abbreviation of the full term, sherab kyi parul tu chinpa (shes-rab kyi pha-rol tu
phyin-pa, or prajnya paramita).
This class also lasts for a year, and is devoted to covering only the first third
of the first chapter of the root text. (The first chapter is by far the most
extensive.) The topics covered in this and the following five classes are

represented in the following ACI courses:
Course II: Buddhist Refuge
Course XV: What the Buddha Really Meant
Year Four
Class Four: Intermediate Class, First Chapter of the "Ornament"
This class is a continuation of the preceding. It lasts for a year and is devoted
to the second third of the first chapter of Lord Maitreya's root text. The name
of the class in Tibetan is shung-nying (gzhung-rnying), meaning a study of this
great classic (gzhung) by students who are now more advanced (rnying-pa).
Year Five
Class Five: Advanced Class, First Chapter of the "Ornament"
This class is again a continuation of the preceding. It too lasts for a year, and
is devoted to the final third of the first chapter. Its name in Tibetan is shung-
nying gongma (gzhung-rnying gong-ma), meaning an "even more" (gong-ma)
advanced class of more experienced (rnying-pa) students of the great classic
(gzhung).
Year Six
Class Six: Class on the Second and Third Chapters of the "Ornament"
This class is a continuation of the previous, and covers the second and third
chapters of Lord Maitreya's text. It lasts for one year, and is named kab nyipa
(skabs gnyis-pa), since it is devoted to the second (gnyis-pa) and third chapters
(skabs) of the root text.
Years Seven and Eight
Class Seven: Class on the Fourth and Higher Chapters of the "Ornament"
The study of the Ornament continues in this class, dedicated to the fourth, fifth,
sixth, seventh, and eighth chapters of the root text. The eighth chapter is
considered especially important because it is dedicated to a thorough
description of an enlightened being. The name of this class is kab shipa (skabs
bzhi-pa), meaning the students have reached the fourth (bzhi-pa) and higher
chapters (skabs) of the root text. Each of the courses from this point on to the
end of the geshe program last for two years each.

Years Nine and Ten
Class Eight: Class for Supplementary Topics
on the Perfection of Wisdom
The next class is named after and devoted to the study of supplementary topics
on the perfection of wisdom known as surkul (zur-bkol), so called because they
are extensive treatments of particular subjects which are "extracted" (zur-du
bkol-pa) and expanded from much briefer references in the Ornament.
The four classic topics here are dependent origination (rten-'brel); the
permutations of the flowchart that leads to enlightenment, known as the
"community of the twenty" (dge-'dun nyi-shu); the levels of the form and
formless realms, along with their corresponding meditational states (bsam-
gzugs); and the very important study of the art of interpreting statements of the
Buddha (drang-nges).
In conjunction with the last, the members of this class will also engage in a
separate study of the "foundation consciousness" (kun-gzhi, or alaya vijnyana)
concept accepted by the Mind-Only (Citta Matra or Sems-tzam-pa) School, the
lower of the two Mahayana schools of ancient India, and third in the overall
scheme of four schools. This will in fact be the most time ever spent on the
beliefs of this particular school, although it is also touched upon later in the
"Middle-Way" courses.
In Sera Mey, the principal monastic textbooks used for the supplementary
topics are those on each particular subject composed by the masters Kedrup
Tenpa Dargye and Panglung Lobsang Tukje (sPang-lung Blo-bzang thugs-rje, fl.
18th century).
Years Eleven and Twelve
Class Nine: Beginning Class on the Middle Way
Entrance to the ninth class, where a student debater begins his study of the
higher half of the Middle-Way School, marks a major change in status. At Sera
Mey, it is at this point that the monk earns the right to vote upon questions
affecting the monastery at large during the regular assemblies. He has also
normally just finished his rikchung examinations, which in effect qualify him
to become, in time, a geshe.
In Tibet it was a custom at this juncture for the entire surviving class to
approach sponsors and raise the funds to make an important gift to the
monastery in appreciation of her kindness. The gift might be a set of rare and
important books, new paintings or images for the temple altars, or even a

building. Members of the class would also go into deep retreats, intended to
accumulate the good karma necessary to grasp the very subtle points of higher
Middle-Way philosophy, the next subject in the curriculum. It is considered
auspicious if the student encounters difficulty during this retreat (as the sign
of an effective attempt to eliminate previous bad karma), and our Root Lama,
Khen Rinpoche, has said that he became dangerously ill during his retreat in
Tibet at this time.
The name of this class is uma sarpa (dbu-ma gsar-pa), meaning "beginning" (gsar-
pa) class on the beliefs of the higher part of the Middle-Way (dbu-ma) School.
The root text is Entering the Middle Way (Madhyamika Avatara, dBu-ma la 'jug-pa),
composed by Master Chandrakirti (Slob-dpon Zla-ba grags-pa) around 650 AD.
The principal monastic textbooks used are the Illumination of the True Thought
of the Middle Way (dBu-ma dgongs-pa rab-gsal) of Je Tsongkapa, along with its
commentary by Kedrup Tenpa Dargye entitled Overview of the Middle Way
(dBu-ma spyi-don).
The higher half of the Middle-Way School is known as the "Consequence"
(Prasangika, or Thal-'gyur-ba) group, due to their belief that a logical statement
utilizing a ridiculous but necessary consequence of an opponent's erroneous
beliefs is especially effective in helping the opponent develop a correct view
of emptiness. The entire study of this particular group is called "Middle Way"
(Uma, or dBu-ma) in the monastery, although technically the beliefs of the
Independent group, already studied, also qualify as "Middle Way."
The topics covered in this and the next class are represented in the following
ACI courses:
Course VI: The Diamond-Cutter Sutra
Course VII: The Vows of the Bodhisattva
Courses X, XI, and XII: A Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life--Parts
One, Two, and Three
Extension Course 4: The Marriage of Emptiness and Karma
Years Thirteen and Fourteen
Class Ten: Advanced Class on the Middle Way
This class is a continuation of the preceding, and in Tibetan is known as uma
nyingpa (dbu-ma rnying-pa), meaning "advanced" (nying-pa) class on the beliefs
of the higher part of the Middle-Way (dbu-ma) School.

Years Fifteen and Sixteen
Class Eleven: Beginning Class on Vowed Ethics
The class then graduates to the study of vowed ethics (vinaya, or 'dul-ba); here
the curriculum of Sera Mey is unique, since the other major Gelukpa
monasteries continue on to higher knowledge (abhidharma, or chos mngon-pa) at
this point. This course will cover, extensively, the beliefs of certain groups
within the first of the four schools--the Detailist--on the eight different types
of vowed morality.
It is only here that a monk learns, in detail, the finer points of monastic rule.
The debates of this class are a sharp contrast to the high theoretical dialectic
of the Middle Way: here we are more likely to be quoting lists of monastic
guidelines, and memorization of the versed summary on the subject is a
"must." This is the Versed Summary on Vowed Morality by Kongpo Ngawang
Tsultrim (Shar-chen Kong-po Ngag-dbang tsul-khrims), an eminent lama from the
Kongpo College of Sera Mey.
The great commentary of the omniscient Tsonawa (Kun-mkhyen mTso-sna-ba
Shes-rab bzang-po), a Kagyupa master from the latter part of the 14th century,
will also be studied carefully. Both are based, as is the study of vowed
morality throughout Tibet, upon the Summary of Vowed Morality (Vinaya Sutra,
or 'Dul-ba mdo rtza-ba), by the Indian master Guna Prabha (Slob-dpon Yon-tan
'od), from about 500 AD.
The name of this particular class in Tibetan is senkyang dangpo (gzan rkyang
dang-po), since in the old days in Tibet it was only (rkyang) by reaching this
class that a student was first (dang-po) considered senior enough to wear a
heavy sort of monastic shawl (gzan) or cloak called a dagam, on the (very cold)
nights of winter in the Lhasa valley.
The topics covered in this and the next class are represented in ACI Course IX:
The Ethical Life
Years Seventeen and Eighteen
Class Twelve: Advanced Class on Vowed Ethics
This class is a continuation of the preceding, and is given the name dzindra
sumpa ('dzin-grva gsum-pa), meaning third (gsum-pa) class ('dzin-grva) from the
top.

Years Nineteen and Twenty
Class Thirteen: Beginning Class on Higher Knowledge
Year nineteen marks the beginning of the final subject, higher knowledge
(abhidharma, known simply as dzu [mdzod] in the monastery). The original root
text here is the Treasure House of Higher Knowledge (Abhidharma Kosha, or Chos
mngon-pa mdzod), written by Master Vasubandhu (Slob-dpon dbyig-gnyen) in
about 350 AD. This work primarily presents the beliefs of the Kashmiri section
of the Detailist (Vaibhashika, or Bye-brag smra-ba) School, the first of the four
Indian schools, and lower of the two Hinayana schools.
Three monastic textbooks for this subject are featured in the curriculum of Sera
Mey:
The commentary of His Holiness the First Dalai Lama,
Gendun Drup (rGyal-ba dGe-'dun grub, 1391-1474)
entitled Light on the Path to Freedom, an Exposition of
Higher Knowledge (Mdzod-tik thar-lam gsal-byed);
A resolution of difficult points on higher knowledge
popularly known as The Book on Higher Knowledge
by Gyalwang, composed by Gyalwang Trinley
Namgyal (rGyal-dbang 'Phrin-las rnam-rgyal, fl. 1850);
and
An exquisite, highly detailed commentary from the Sakya
tradition entitled The Chim Book on Higher
Knowledge, written by Jampeyang of Chim (mChims
'Jam-pa'i dbyangs, c. 1280).
The name for this class in Tibetan is dzindra nyipa ('dzin-grva gnyis-pa), so called
because it is the second (gnyis-pa) class ('dzin-grva) from the top.
The topics covered in this and the next class are represented in the following
ACI courses:
Course V: How Karma Works
Course VIII: Death and the Realms of Existence

Years Twenty-One and Twenty-Two
Class Fourteen: Advanced Class on Higher Knowledge
This class is a continuation of the preceding, and in Tibetan is called dzindra
dangpo ('dzin-grva dang-po), meaning it is the first (dang-po) class ('dzin-grva), or
the highest class of all. The minimum stay for a person in this class would be
two years, but this could stretch out into three, four, or even more years, since
a student is required to remain until he can complete his examinations for any
of the ranks of a geshe.
Annually for the Entire Geshe Program
Special Winter Classes on Buddhist Logic and Perceptual Theory
Throughout the entire length of a monk's career in the geshe program, several
months in the winter are reserved for special classes on Buddhist logic and
perceptual theory, based upon the Commentary on Valid Perception (Pramana
Varttika, Tsad-ma rnam-'grel) of Master Dharmakirti (Slob-dpon Chos-kyi grags-pa),
who lived about 650 AD.
The principal monastic commentary here is Light on the Path to Freedom, an
Explanation of the "Commentary on Valid Perception," by one of the principal
disciples of Je Tsongkapa, Gyaltsab Je Darma Rinchen (rGyal-tsab rje Dar-ma
rin-chen, 1364-1432). At Sera Mey, a new commentary by Geshe Yeshe
Wangchuk (dGe-bshes Ye-shes dbang-phyug, 1928-1997) is also very popular.
Normally each class simply takes its name from whichever major topic it may
be debating at the time.
One reason the text by Gyaltsab Je is so widely used is that it is studied in all
of the major Gelukpa monasteries, and can thus be used as common scriptural
authority during the annual Jang Gunchu, or Winter Debates--a kind of annual
Olympic intensive where the best student monks from each of the major
colleges can come together to study and debate, almost day and night, for an
entire month.
Here all the students from each monastery who are debating the same subject
join into a single class, which acts as an excellent preparation for the debates
they will have with each other during the geshe examinations down the road.
Back home, those from each monastery who did not qualify for the Winter
Debates continue on these same general subject; this provides a good
opportunity for students of medium or lesser ability to take center stage at the
debate park and improve themselves.

The topics for the Winter Debates are represented in the following ACI
Courses:
Course IV: The Proof of Future Lives
Course XIII: The Art of Reasoning
Special Teachings by Eminent Lamas
Throughout the geshe program, a student will also attend special teachings
given by eminent Lamas, both inside and outside their home monasteries.
Actual recent examples at Sera Mey, for example, would be a one month
teaching on the steps of the path to Buddhahood (lam-rim) presented by Geshe
Yeshe Wangchuk, or a teaching by His Holiness the Dalai Lama on emptiness.
The most frequent subjects of these teachings are either lam-rim or lojong:
developing the good heart. The content of these special teachings often comes
up later in the debate park, in conjunction with almost every other subject. For
this reason, the teachings on lam-rim and lojong have been organized into a
sixth subject in the ACI curriculum, and are represented in the following
courses:
Course I: The Principal Teachings of Buddhism
Course III: Applied Meditation
Course XIV: Lojong, Developing the Good Heart
Extension Course 1: Offering of the Mandala
Extension Course 2: Contemplations on the Practice of Giving and
Taking (Tong-Len)
Extension Course 5: Lord Atisha's Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment
Extension Course 6: The Garden--Discussions with the Great Masters
of Buddhism
_______________
The invasion of Tibet led to a great deal of disruption in the debate classes.
For twelve years after the fall of Tibet in 1959, the surviving monks from all
of the major Gelukpa monasteries were thrown together in the Buxall refugee
camp in northeastern India. Only several hundred of over 10,000 student
monks from Lhasa lived through the invasion and subsequent horrors of the
Buxall camp, to reach their new home in south India.
In the early 1970's, land was found in the Karnataka area of south India for the
re-establishment of these major monasteries. (Khen Rinpoche's older brother,
a Tibetan government official, was instrumental in locating and securing the

land.) The debating classes and geshe examinations continued throughout this
time in a very tenuous way, and by the mid 1970's it looked as though there
would not be enough support for them to be carried on at Sera Mey.
This is when Khen Rinpoche began the food fund for students in the geshe
program, which proved to be a deciding factor in their survival. Khen
Rinpoche and his students also provided a great deal of the support needed to
revive the Winter Debates in India. The debate classes throughout the great
Gelukpa monasteries of south India now thrive, and the level of study is said
to rival that of Old Tibet.

Course XIII: The Art of Reasoning
Reading Ten: The Concept of Time
Selection from the collected topics:
The Concept of Time
The following selections on the concept of time (Dus-gsum gyi rnam-bzhag), are
excerpted from The Collected Topics of Rato (Rva-stod bsdus-grva), by Master Chok-
hla U-ser, a great master of Rato Monastery who lived about 1500 AD. This
particular book is considered the "grandfather" of what came to be a separate genre of
literature in Tibet: the dura (bsdus-grva), or "selected topics from the Commentary on
Valid Perception (Pramana Varttika, or Tsad-ma rnam-'grel) of Master Dharmakirti
(circa 650 AD).
Please note that indented statements are usually those given by the opponent.
Responses within brackets are those that are usually left unwritten in the Tibetan text,
and are understood to be there because of the context following each.

`YANG KHA CIG NA RE, SKYES LA 'GAGS PA, 'DAS PA'I MTSAN NYID, SKYES LA MA 'GAGS PA, DA LTAR BA'I MTSAN NYID, SKYES PA'I RGYU YOD KYANG MA SKYES PA'I CHA, MA 'ONGS PA'I MTSAN NYID,
Suppose someone comes again, and makes the following claim:
The definition of the past is: "That which has begun and
stopped." The definition of the present is: "That which has begun
and not yet stopped." The definition of the future is: "That
condition of having not yet begun, although the causes for
beginning are present."

TOG,GNYIS PA'I MTSAN GZHI, DO ZHAG GI LO TOG, GSUM PA'I MTSAN GZHI ZER NA,
Respective examples would be the following. For the first, the
example would be last year's crops. For the second, it would be
this year's crops; and, for the third, crops soon to grow.

DANG PO LA, 'DAS PA'I MTSAN NYID DANG MTSAN GZHI DE MI 'THAD PAR THAL, 'DAS PA'I MTSAN NYID MED PA'I PHYIR TE, 'DAS PA MED PA'I PHYIR TE, GZHI GRUB NA, DA LTAR BA YIN PAS KHYAB PA'I PHYIR,
Concerning the first of these, we answer as follows.
Aren't your definition and example for the past though incorrect?
Because there is no definition for the past,
And this is because the past doesn't even exist,
And this is because anything which can be established as existing is always
something of the present.

BYAS PA LA KHO NA RE, 'DAS PA YOD PAR THAL, 'DAS PA'I DUS YOD PA'I PHYIR TE, 'DAS PA'I DUS DANG , MA 'ONGS PA'I DUS DANG , DA LTAR BA'I DUS GSUM YOD PA'I PHYIR TE, DUS GSUM YOD PA'I PHYIR NA, MA KHYAB,
On this point, someone may come and make the following claim:
But there must be things that are past,
Because past time exists;
And this is because all three--past time, and future time, and present
time--exist.
And this is because the three times exist.
To this we answer, "It doesn't necessarily follow."

'O NA, KHO RANG LA, 'DAS PA 'DAS PA YIN PAR THAL, 'DAS PA YOD PA'I PHYIR,
RTAGS KHAS,
And we also ask this person,
So is the past the past?
Because the past exists.
You already agreed to the reason here.

'DOD NA, 'DAS PA CHOS CAN, 'DAS PA MA YIN PAR THAL, 'GAGS PA MA YIN PA'I PHYIR TE, ZHIG PA MA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[Then I agree to your original statement: the past is the past.]
Suppose you agree to our original statement.
Consider the past.
It is not so the past,
Because it is not something which has stopped;
And this is true because it is not something which has been destroyed.

KHYAB STE, 'DAS PA 'GAGS PA ZHIG PA GSUM DON GCIG YIN PA'I PHYIR TE, DE GSUM KA YOD PA'I PHYIR TE, 'DAS PA YOD PA'I PHYIR, RTAGS KHAS,
[It doesn't necessarily follow.]
But it does necessarily follow,
Because "the past," "that which has stopped," and "that which has been
destroyed" all refer to the same thing.
And this is true because all three of them exist;
And this is true because the past exists.
You already agreed that the reason is true.

MA KHYAB 'TSAMS LA MA GRUB NA, 'DAS PA CHOS CAN, ZHIG PA MA YIN PAR THAL, DNGOS PO YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Suppose that, instead of "it doesn't necessarily follow," the opponent says "it's
incorrect."
Consider the past.
It is not so something which has been destroyed,
Because it is a working thing.

KHYAB STE, ZHIG PA DANG DNGOS PO'I GZHI MTHUN MED PA'I PHYIR TE, LEGS BSHAD GSER GYI 'PHRENG BA LAS, RANG BZHIN GYIS GRUB PAR 'DZIN PA'I PHYOGS THAMS CAD LA, ZHIG PA DNGOS POR NI MI BZHED LA, ZHES GSUNGS PA'I PHYIR,
[It doesn't necessarily follow.]
But it does necessarily follow,
Because there exists no one thing which is both (1) something that has been
destroyed but which is still (2) a working thing.
And this is true because the Golden Necklace of Good Explanation says,
None of the schools that belong to the side that believe that
things exist through some nature of their own accept the idea
that something which has been destroyed could be a working
thing.
[The Golden Necklace is a famed commentary by Je Tsongkapa upon the
Ornament of Realizations, spoken to the realized being Asanga by Lord
Maitreya.]

SNGA MA LA MA GRUB NA, 'DAS PA CHOS CAN, DNGOS PO YIN PAR THAL, BYAS PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[Then I disagree to your earlier statement.]
Suppose you say that the earlier one is not correct.
Consider the past.
It is so a working thing,
Because it is something made.

MA GRUB NA, DE CHOS CAN, `DER THAL, SKYES PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[It's not correct to say that the past is something made.]
Suppose you say that it's not correct.
Consider this same thing.
It is so,
Because it's something that started.

KHYAB STE, SKYES PA BYAS PA'I MTSAN NYID YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[It doesn't necessarily follow.]
But it does necessarily follow,
Because "something that started" is the definition of "something made."

SNGA MAR MA GRUB NA, 'DAS PA CHOS CAN, SKYES PA YIN PAR THAL, SKYES LA 'GAGS PA YIN PA'I PHYIR TE, 'DAS PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[The earlier point is not correct.]
Suppose you say that the earlier point is not correct.
Consider the past.
It is so something that started,
Because it is something that started and then stopped.
And this is true because it's the past.

RTAGS GSAL KHAS BLANGS, KHYAB PA MTSAN NYID KYI STENG DU DNGOS, GZHAN YANG , ZHIG PA DNGOS PO YIN PAR THAL, 'DAS PA DNGOS PO YIN PA'I PHYIR,
You've agreed both to the reason and to what we're asserting must be so, and
the necessity is something that does apply to the definition.
It must moreover be true that that which has been destroyed is a working
thing,
Because the past is a working thing.

RTAGS BSGRUBS ZIN, 'DOD NA, DNGOS PO ZHIG PA DNGOS PO YIN PAR THAL, DNGOS PO ZHIG PA YOD PA GANG ZHIG, ZHIG PA DNGOS PO YIN PA'I PHYIR,
We've already established that the reason is true.
Suppose you do agree.
Is it then the case that a working thing which has been destroyed is still a
working thing?
Because (1) there does exist a working thing which has been destroyed, and (2)
that which has been destroyed is a working thing.

RTAGS PHYI MA KHAS, DANG PO GRUB STE, DNGOS PO 'DAS PA YOD PA'I PHYIR,
You've already agreed to the latter part of the reason.
Suppose now you say that the first part is not correct.
The first is too correct,
Because there does exist a working thing which is past.

MA GRUB NA, DNGOS PO CHOS CAN, KHYOD 'DAS PA YOD PAR THAL, KHYOD 'DUS BYAS YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[It's not correct to say that there does exist a working thing which is
past.]
Suppose you say that it's not correct.
Consider a working thing.
There does too exist it past,
Because it is something that has been produced.

RTZA BA'I THAL 'GYUR GNYIS PA LA 'DOD NA, SHING ZHIG PA SHING YIN PAR THAL, DNGOS PO ZHIG PA DNGOS PO YIN PA'I PHYIR, RTAGS KHAS,
[Then I agree to your second original statement: it is the case that a
working thing which has been destroyed is still a working thing.]
Suppose you agree to our second original statement.
So is a tree that was already destroyed still a tree?

Because a working thing which has been destroyed is still a working thing.
You've already accepted the reason.

'DOD NA, SHING MES TSIG GI 'OG ROL DU SHING YOD PAR THAL, SHING ZHIG PA SHING GANG ZHIG, SHING MES TSIG PA'I 'OG ROL DU SHING ZHIG PA YOD PA'I PHYIR TE, SHING MES TSIG PA'I TSE SHING ZHIG PA'I PHYIR,
[Then I agree to your original statement: a tree that was already
destroyed is still a tree.]
Suppose you agree to our original statement.
So is it then true that when a tree has been burned up by fire there is still a
tree?
Because (1) a tree that was already destroyed is a tree; and (2) there exists a
destroyed tree subsequent to the burning up of a tree by a fire.
And this is so because--when a tree has been burned up by fire--there is a
tree destroyed.

GONG DU 'DOD NA, SHING MES TSIG PA'I 'OG ROL DU SHING MIG SHES KYIS MTHONG BAR THAL, DE'I 'OG ROL DU SHING YOD PA'I PHYIR, RTAGS KHAS,
[I agree to your statement above.]
Suppose you agree to our statement above.
Is it then the case that--subsequent to the burning up of a tree by a fire--you
can still see a tree by using your visual consciousness?
Because there does exist a tree subsequent to that point.
You already agreed to the reason.

KHYAB PA GRUB CING , 'DOD MI NUS TE, RNAM 'GREL LAS, SKYE PHYIR 'JIG PA 'JIG CAN 'GYUR, , DE LTAR NA 'ANG SHING MTHONG 'GYUR, , ZHES PA'I GZHUNG DE ZHIG PA DNGOS POR 'DOD PA LA HA CANG THAL BA'I SKYON 'PHEN PA'I GZHUNG YIN PA'I PHYIR,
If the one is the case, then the other is necessarily so. [That is, if there does
exist a tree subsequent to that point, then you must be able to see it by
using your visual consciousness.]
And you cannot agree to this last statement;
Because the following quotation from the Commentary on Valid Perception was
meant to point out--to those who asserted that something which was
destroyed could ever be a working thing--what very absurd
consequences their position entailed:
Because it has started, then the destruction
Must be destroyed; and then the tree
Would have to be seen once more.

RTZA BA'I MTSAN NYID GNYIS PA LA, SHES BYA CHOS CAN, SKYES LA MA 'GAGS PA YIN PAR THAL, DA LTAR BA YIN PA'I PHYIR, KHYAB PA KHAS,
Concerning the second of the original definitions, [that the definition of the
present is "that which has begun and not yet stopped,"] we pose the
following:
Consider "knowable things."
So is it something which has begun and not yet stopped?
Because it is something of the present.
[It doesn't necessarily follow.]
But you already agree that it does necessarily follow.

RTAGS GRUB STE, GZHI GRUB PA'I PHYIR,
[It's not correct to say that "knowable things" is something of the
present.]
It is so correct,
Because it can be established as existing.

GONG DU 'DOD NA, SHES BYA CHOS CAN, SKYES PAR THAL, SKYES LA MA 'GAGS PA'I PHYIR, RTAGS KHAS,
[Then I agree to your statement above: "knowable things" is something
that has begun and not yet stopped.]
Suppose you agree to our statement above.
Consider "knowable things."
So is it something which ever began?
Because it has begun and not yet stopped.
You already agreed to the reason.

'DOD NA, DE CHOS CAN, MA SKYES PAR THAL, RTAG PA YIN PA'I PHYIR, 'DOD NA, DNGOS,
[Then I agree to your statement.]
Suppose you agree to our statement.
Consider this same thing..
It is not so, that it is something which ever began,
Because it is an unchanging thing.
If you agreed [that an unchanging thing could begin], then what we would
answer to you is obvious.

RTZA BA'I MTSAN NYID GSUM PA LA, MA 'ONGS PA YOD PAR THAL, DE'I MTSAN NYID YOD PA'I PHYIR TE, SKYE BA'I RGYU YOD KYANG MA SKYES PA'I CHA DE, MA 'ONGS PA'I MTSAN NYID YIN PA'I PHYIR, RTAGS KHAS,
Concerning the third of the original definitions, [that the definition of the
future is: "that condition of having not yet begun, although the causes
for beginning are present,"] we pose the following:
So is it true then that the future exists?
Because it is something which has a definition;
Because "that condition of having not yet begun, although the causes for
beginning are present" is the definition of the future.
You already agreed that the reason was true.

GONG DU 'DOD NA, MA 'ONGS PA KHO KHO RANG YIN PAR THAL, DE YOD PA'I PHYIR,
[Then I agree to your point above.]
Suppose you agree to the above.
So is it then the case that the future is itself?
Because it does exist.

'DOD NA, MA 'ONGS PA CHOS CAN, SKYE BA'I RGYU YOD KYANG MA SKYES PA'I CHA YIN PAR THAL, MA 'ONGS PA YIN PA'I PHYIR, RTAGS KHAS, KHYAB PA MTSAN NYID KYI STENG DU DNGOS,
[I agree to your statement: the future is itself.]
Suppose you agree to our original statement.
Consider the future.
So is it then a condition of having not yet begun, although the causes for
beginning are present?
Because it is the future.
You already agreed to the reason,
And it is obvious that the necessity must apply to the definition.

'DOD NA, RTZI DANG BYAS PAS, KHA CIG, MA 'ONGS PA, SKYE BA'I RGYU YOD KYANG MA SKYES PA'I CHA YIN PAR 'DOD ZER, KHA CIG, RTZOD GZHI CHA DE NAS SKYE BA'I RGYU YOD KYANG MA SKYES PA'I CHA YIN PA 'DOD ZER,
[Then I agree.]
Suppose you agree.
Depending on how they read this definition [in the Tibetan], some people
claim, "I agree that the future is the condition of having not yet begun,
although the causes for beginning are present (Tib: skye ba'i rgyu yod)." Others
claim, "I agree that the object of our argument [the future] is the condition of
having not yet begun, even though it has cause to begin from this same
condition (Tib: skye ba'i rgyu yod)."

'O NA, RTZI LUGS SNGA MA LA, MA 'ONGS PA SKYE BA'I RGYU YOD PAR THAL, DE SKYE BA'I RGYU YOD KYANG MA SKYES PA'I CHA YIN PA'I PHYIR, RTAGS KHAS,
Well suppose then that you read it the first way.
So does there exist a cause that makes the future begin?
Because the future is the condition of having not yet begun, even though the
causes for beginning are present.
You've already accepted the reason.

'DOD NA, MA 'ONGS PA SKYE BA'I RGYU DNGOS PO YIN PAR THAL, DE YOD PA'I PHYIR,
[I agree that there does exist a cause that makes the future begin.]
Suppose you agree.
So is this cause that makes the future begin a working thing?
Because it does exist.

'DOD NA, MA 'ONGS PA SKYE BA'I RGYU CHOS CAN, BYAS PA YIN PAR THAL, DNGOS PO YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[I agree that it is.]
Suppose you agree.
Consider this cause that makes the future begin.
Is it something made?
Because it is a working thing.

'DOD NA, DE CHOS CAN, SKYES PA YIN PAR THAL, BYAS PA YIN PA'I PHYIR, RTAGS KHAS,
[I agree that it is a working thing.]
Suppose you agree.
Consider this same thing.
Is it then something which has begun?
Because it is something made.
You already agreed to the reason.

'DOD MI NUS TE, MA SKYES PA YIN PA'I PHYIR TE, MA SKYES PA'I CHA YIN PA'I PHYIR TE, YOD KYANG MA SKYES PA'I CHA YIN PA'I PHYIR, RTAGS GSAL KHAS BLANGS,
But you cannot agree,
Because it is something which has not yet begun;
Because it is the condition of having not yet begun;
Because it is a condition where, even though [its cause] exists, it has not yet
begun.
You've already agreed both to the reason and to what we're asserting must be
so.

RTZA BA'I RTZI LUGS PHYI MA LA SKYON 'DI LTAR, SKYE BA'I RGYU DNGOS PO YIN PAR THAL, SKYE BA'I RGYU YOD PA'I PHYIR,
And the following problem applies to the latter way of reading the phrase.
Is it then the case that this cause that will make it begin is a working thing?
Because the cause that will make the future begin exists.

MA GRUB NA, SKYE BA'I RGYU CHOS CAN, YOD PAR THAL, YOD KYANG MA SKYE BA'I CHA YIN PA'I PHYIR, RTAGS GSAL KHAS,
[It's not correct to say that the cause that will make the future begin
exists.]
Suppose you say that it's not correct.
Consider this cause that will make the future begin.
It does so exist,
Because [the future] is a condition where, even though [its cause exists], it has
not yet begun.
You've already agreed both to the reason and to what we're asserting must be
so.

MA KHYAB NA, RNAM BZHAG MA CHAGS SO, ,
[It doesn't necessarily follow.]
If you say it doesn't necessarily follow, then your whole presentation collapses.
 GONG DU 'DOD NA, SKYE BA'I RGYU CHOS CAN, SKYES PAR THAL, DNGOS PO YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[Then I agree to your statement above.]
Suppose you agree to our statement above.
Consider the cause that makes [the future] begin.
It must then be something which has begun,
Because it is a working thing.

'DOD NA, DE CHOS CAN, MA SKYES PAR THAL, MA SKYES PA'I CHOS YIN PA'I PHYIR TE, MA SKYES PA'I CHA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[I agree that the cause that makes the future begin is something which
has begun.]
Suppose you agree.
Consider then this same thing.
It is not the case that it has already begun,
Because it is a thing which has yet to begin,
Because it is a condition of not having yet begun.

MA GRUB NA, SKYE BA'I RGYU CHOS CAN, MA SKYES PA'I CHA YIN PAR THAL, YOD KYANG MA SKYES PA'I CHA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
[It's not correct to say that the cause which makes the future begin is a
condition of not having yet begun.]
Suppose you say that it's not correct.
Consider this cause that makes the future begin.
It is so the condition of not having yet begun,
Because it is the condition of having not yet begun, even though it exists.

RTAGS GSAL GNYIS KA KHAS,
You've already both to the reason and to what we're asserting must be so.

_______________

`KHA CIG GIS, SKYE BA'I RGYU YOD DAM MED ZER NA,
Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
Does there exist a cause for something to begin or not?

RANG RES YOD BYAS PA LA KHO NA RE, SKYE BA'I RGYU MED PAR THAL, SKYE BA MED PA'I PHYIR TE, DNGOS PO YIN NA, SKYE BA MA YIN PAS KHYAB PA'I PHYIR TE, DNGOS PO YIN NA, SKYES ZIN PAS KHYAB PA GANG ZHIG, SKYES ZIN GYI DNGOS PO SLAR YANG BTAB STE SKYE BA MED PA'I PHYIR ZER NA,
We answer that there does, and then someone comes and makes the following
claim:
But isn't it the case that no cause for something to begin exists?
Because isn't it the case that nothing beginning exists?
Because isn't it the case that, if something is a working thing, it can
never be beginning?
Because (1) isn't it the case that, if something is a working thing, it must
be something that began already; and (2) isn't it the case that, if
a working thing has begun already, it cannot start all over again?
 'DIR MA KHYAB,
To this we answer, "It doesn't necessarily follow."
_______________

`YANG KHO NA RE, SKYE BA MED PAR THAL, SKYE 'GYUR DANG , SKYE DGOS DANG , SKYE KHA MA DANG , SKYE BZHIN PA RNAMS RE RE NAS MED PA'I PHYIR NA,
Suppose someone comes again and claims,

So is it then the case that there are no beginnings at all?
Because none of the following exist: "something that's going to begin,"
"something that needs to begin," "something that's about to
begin," and "something that's in the act of beginning."

MA KHYAB PA'I LAN BTAB NAS, 'DI LTAR, SKYE BA YOD PAR THAL, SKYE BA SNGA PHYI YOD PA'I PHYIR TE, SKYE BA SNGA PHYI DU MAR TSOGS GNYIS GOMS PA YOD PA'I PHYIR TE, SKYE BA SNGA PHYI DU MAR TSOGS GNYIS GOMS PA LAS TSAD MA'I SKYES BUR 'KHRUNGS PA YOD PA'I PHYIR TE,
To this we say, "It doesn't necessarily follow," and then we say:
It's like this. The beginning or the birth of something does too
exist,
Because past and future births exist.
And this is true because there exists the practice of amassing the two
collections over a great many births, past and future.
And this is true because there does exist the creation of an Infallible
Being, who comes from the practice of amassing the two
collections over a great many births, past and future.

SGRUB BYED LA LTOS TSAD YIN RIGS, ZHES PA DANG , SGRUB BYED THUGS RJE GOMS LAS TE, , ZHES PA RNAMS KYI DON GRUB PA'I PHYIR,
And this itself is true, because there is a point to the following
two quotations:
By relying on the various proofs
It's right to say "infallible."
And--
The proof is that it comes from the practice
Of the attitude of compassion.
[Both quotations are from the Commentary on Valid Perception, and are used to
establish that an Enlightened Being is produced from many eons spent amassing the
two collections.]

Are you saying, moreover, that it is proper to throw away the whole system
of those Lords of Reasoning, the Father and his spiritual Sons, and go
following the system of that non-Buddhist school, the Rejectionists
(Lokayata)?
Because you would have to accept the other side as our side in the following
verses:
"An Infallible One would have to know
Even things that are hidden, and there's
No proof that shows he can;
Neither is there a way to try."
Thus do a number of them
Make their presentation.
And--
Because the mind is something
That depends upon the body,
There is nothing you can achieve
Through practice [over many lifetimes].

And this is true because it would then be right for you to accept the position
that it's impossible for there to exist an enlightened realized being who has
practiced assembling the two collections over a great many births, past and
future.

`YANG KHO NA RE, SKYE KHA MA'I DNGOS PO YOD PAR THAL, MA'I MNGAL NAS SKYE KHA MA'I DNGOS PO YOD PA'I PHYIR ZER NA,
Suppose someone comes again and claims,
There must too exist a working thing which is about to begin,
Because there exists a working thing which is about to
take birth from their mother's womb.

SKYE BZHIN PA'I DNGOS PO YOD PAR THAL, MA'I MNGAL NAS SKYE BZHIN PA'I DNGOS PO YOD PA'I PHYIR, KHYAB PA 
So does there exist then a working thing which is in the act of beginning?
Because there exists a working which is about to take birth from their mother's
womb.
The fact that it follows is something you find acceptable.

'GRIG'DOD MI NUS TE, DPAL LDAN ZLA BAS, SKYE BZHIN PA NI SKYE LA PHYOGS PAS YOD MIN ZHING , , ZHES GSUNGS PA'I PHYIR,
But you cannot agree, because the glorious Chandrakirti has stated, "Since
something in the act of beginning is only approaching beginning, it is not
something which exists."

GZHAN YANG , MA SKYES PA'I DNGOS PO YOD PAR THAL, MA'I MNGAL NAS MA SKYES PA'I DNGOS PO YOD PA'I PHYIR,
And are you, furthermore, saying that there exists a working thing which
hasn't begun?
Because there exists a working thing which hasn't begun, from their mother's
womb.

KHA CIG, RTAGS MA GRUB ZER NA,
Suppose someone comes and says, "It's incorrect [to say that there exists a
working thing which hasn't begun, from their mother's womb].

RTAGS GRUB STE, MA'I MNGAL DU GNAS BZHIN PA'I SKYES BU YOD PA GANG ZHIG, RDZUS SKYES KYI DNGOS PO YANG YOD PA'I PHYIR,
But it is correct, because (1) there does exist a person who is in the act of
staying in their mother's womb, and (2) there also exists a working thing which
is born complete.

Are you saying, moreover, that a working thing which has already begun
begins again?
Because there exists a living being who has already taken birth, and who has
to take birth again.
And this is true because there exists a living being who has already taken
birth, and who has to take birth again in the circle of suffering life.
And this is true because (1) there exists a living being who has already taken
birth as a human, and who has to take birth again as a human; and (2)
there exists a living being who has already taken birth into the desire
realm, and who has to take birth into the desire realm again.

RTAGS RE RE NAS GRUB STE, MI NAS MIR SKYE BA DANG , 'DOD PA NAS 'DOD PAR SKYE BA YOD PA'I PHYIR, RTAGS SLA'O,
Each of the reasons given is correct, because there do exist those who come
from a birth as a human and are born as a human; and there do exist those

who come from a birth in the desire realm and are born into the desire realm.
It's easy to accept these reasons.

GZHAN YANG , 'BYUNG BA MED PAR THAL, DNGOS PO YIN NA, 'BYUNG BA MA YIN PAS KHYAB PA'I PHYIR TE, DNGOS PO YIN NA, BYUNG ZIN PAS KHYAB PA'I PHYIR, KHYAB PA 'GRIGS,
And is it, moreover, the case that there exists nothing which is occurring?
Because nothing which is a working thing could ever be something which is
occurring.
And this is because anything which is a working thing is something which has

The fact that it follows is something you find acceptable.

The reason we've stated is correct, because anything which is a working thing
is something which has already occurred from its own causes.
And this is true because anything which is a working thing is something
which has already begun from its own causes.

[Then I agree to your original statement: it is the case that there exists
nothing which is occurring.]
Suppose you agree to our original statement.
There does too exist something which is occurring,
Because there exist the four great elements.
And this is because there do exist the four of earth, water, fire, and wind.
[Translator's note: This argument depends upon the fact that the Tibetan words for
"occuring" and for "element" have the same spelling ('byung ba).]

[It doesn't necessarily follow.]
It does necessarily follow, because that highest master, Vasubandhu, has stated
that the great elements are four.
And this is true because the Treasure House says,
The elements are the following:
The divisions of elements we call
Earth and water and fire and wind.

Suppose yet another person comes and claims:
There must too exist a working thing which still has to start,
Because there does exist a working thing which is going to start.
And this is because there does exist a working thing which is going to
occur.

MA KHYAB, RTAGS GRUB STE, SNGO SER DKAR DMAR BZHI SOGS 'BYUNG 'GYUR YIN PA'I PHYIR DANG , 'BYUNG 'GYUR GYI REG BYA YOD PA'I PHYIR TE, REG BYA LA 'BYUNG BA DANG 'BYUNG 'GYUR GNYIS YOD PA'I PHYIR,
To this we answer, "It doesn't necessarily follow."
The reason in itself though does apply to the subject,
Because the four of blue, yellow, white, and red and the like are all derivatives
of the elements, and there also exist tangible objects which are
derivatives of the elements.
And this is true because all tangible objects can be divided into two types:
those that are elements, and those that are derivatives of the elements.

[Translator's note: This argument depends on the fact that the Tibetan for "going to
occur" and for "derivative of the elements" is the same ('byung-'gyur).]

MDZOD LAS, REG BYA RNAM PA GNYIS YIN TE, , ZHES GSUNGS PA'I PHYIR,
And this is true because The Treasure House of Wisdom says,
Tangible objects are of two types...

RTZA BAR 'DOD MI NUS TE, DNGOS PO YIN NA, SKYES ZIN PAS KHYAB PA'I PHYIR,
You can't though agree to the original statement, [that there must exist a
working thing which still has to start],
Because anything which is a working thing is something which must have
already started.

DE LA KHO NA RE, 'BYUNG 'GYUR GYI DNGOS PO MED PAR THAL, DNGOS PO YIN NA, BYUNG ZIN PAS KHYAB PA'I PHYIR, ZHES KHA CIG ZER BA NI,
On this point some may make the following claim:
It must so be the case that there exists no working thing which is going
to occur,
Because anything which is a working thing must have already occurred.
 LEGS PAR MA BRTAGS PAS NONGS PA YIN TE, SKYE 'GYUR DANG SKYE DGOS ZHES PA SLAR SKYE 'GYUR DANG , SLAR SKYE DGOS KHO NA LA BYED PAR MTSUNGS KYANG ,
This position though reflects a gross error of failing to examine things
thoroughly. The expressions "going to start" and "still needs to start" are
equivalent in meaning, exclusively, "going to start from the beginning" and
"still needs to start from the beginning."

But whereas "still needs to occur" means, exclusively, "still needs to occur from
the beginning," the [Tibetan phrase for] "going to occur" also applies to things
which have already occurred, such as the color blue, or the tangible objects of
heat or cold, and so on. And the mistake by the opponent here is that they
have never heard the terms explained this way.

Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
The definition of something "past" relative to the time of a water pitcher
is "that which has started and also stopped, in the time that the water
pitcher is present."
The definition of something "future" relative to the time of a water
pitcher is "that which is such that--although the causes for it to start are
already present--it has yet to start, in the time that the water pitcher is
present."
The definition of something "present" relative to the time of a water
pitcher is "that which has started and not yet stopped, in the time that
the water pitcher is present."

Let us address the first of these definitions.
Consider the cause of a water pitcher.
Is this cause then something which has started and also stopped, in the time
that the water pitcher is present?
Because it is something which is past relative to the time of the water pitcher.
And this is because it is the example we've chosen here.

And suppose you agree to the previous statement. [That is, suppose you agree
that the cause of a water pitcher is something which has started and
also stopped in the time of the water pitcher.]
Consider again the cause of a water pitcher.
Is it then one thing which has both (1) started in the time of the water pitcher
and (2) stopped in the time of the water pitcher?
[Why do you say that?]
Because you agreed.

'DOD NA, DE CHOS CAN, BUM PA'I DUS SU SKYES PA YIN PAR THAL, 'DOD PA'I PHYIR,
[Then I agree that the cause of a water pitcher is one thing which has
both (1) started in the time of the water pitcher and (2) stopped
in the time of the water pitcher.]
Suppose you agree then.
Consider this same thing.
Is it then something which has started in the time of the water pitcher?
[Why do you say that?]
Because you agreed above.

'DOD MI NUS TE, BUM PA'I DUS SU MA SKYES PA YIN PA'I PHYIR TE, DE'I DUS SU MA BYAS PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
And yet you can't agree, because it is something which has not started in the
time of the water pitcher.
And this is because it is something which has not been made in the time of the
water pitcher.

[It's not necessarily the case that, because the cause of a pitcher is
something which has not been made in the time of the water
pitcher, it must be something which has not started in the time
of the water pitcher.]
Suppose you say that it's not necessarily the case.
It is though necessarily the case,
Because the very definition of something's not having been made in a certain
time is "something's not having started" in that same time.
And this is true because (1) there is at that time something which hasn't been
made, and (2) the definition of "something that hasn't been made" is
"something that hasn't started."
And this is true because "something that has started" is the definition of
"something that has been made."

Now suppose that you were to answer "it's not correct to say that" above,
where you answered "it doesnt' necessarily follow." [That is, suppose
you say that it's not correct to say that the cause of a water pitcher is
something which has not been made in the time of the water pitcher.]
Consider this same thing.
It is so true that it has not been made in that particular time,
Because it doesn't even exist in that particular time.
And this is because it has stopped in that particular time.
And this is because, in that particular time, it has started and also stopped.
And you've already agreed to what we stated as our reason.

PHYIR TE, MA 'GAGS PA YIN PA'I PHYIR TE, 'DUS BYAS YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Consider, moreover, the cause of a water pitcher, once again.
It is not so, that it is one thing which has both (1) started in the time of the
water pitcher, and (2) stopped in this same time,
Because it is not something which has stopped.
And this is true because it hasn't stopped.
And this is true because it is a produced thing.

`YANG KHO NA RE, BUM PA'I RGYU CHOS CAN, BUM PA'I DUS SU SKYES PA YIN PAR THAL, BUM PA'I DUS SU SKYES ZIN PA'I PHYIR NA, MA KHYAB,
Suppose yet another person comes, and makes this claim:
Consider the cause of a water pitcher.
It is too something which has started in the time of the water pitcher,
Because it has finished starting in the time of the water pitcher.
To this we answer, "It doesn't necessarily follow."

Therefore we have to express the situation as follows: Although the cause of
the water pitcher, in the time of the water pitcher, has already begun, it is not
something which has begun in the time of the water pitcher. This is for
example like the case where the followers of the Independent group of the
Middle-Way School and such say that "Cause and effect is true [Tib: bden-pa],
but not real [Tib: bden-pa]." You have to be able to make the same kind of
distinction here.

Suppose someone comes along and claims,
Even though omniscience perceives a water pitcher directly, it
does not do so in the sense that the word "directly" has when we
divide perception into the two of "direct" and "deductive."
To this we answer, "You are absolutely correct."

If however someone were to come along in a debate and say that "Every state
of direct perception is 'direct' in the sense that this word has when we divide
perception into the two of 'direct' and 'deductive'," some logic would be
required to prove the point just made.

As for the second definition, [the definition of "the future" given above,]
consider the result of a water pitcher.
Is it then something that has not begun?
Because it is the condition of not having begun.
And this is because it is the condition of not having begun, even though the
causes for its beginning exist in the time of the water pitcher.

`KHA CIG, MA KHYAB ZER YANG BSDUS GRVA MA CHAGS PA'I RTAGS SO, ,
Now some may come along and claim, in response, that "it doesn't necessarily
follow." This however would indicate that they had yet to grasp the meaning
of the collected topics on logic and perception.

Suppose someone else came and said, instead, that "Your reason is not correct."
Consider then this same thing: [the result of a water pitcher].
Are you saying that it is the condition of not having begun, even though, in
the time of the pitcher, the causes for its beginning are present?
Because it is "the future" at this same time.
The correctness of our reason is easy to accept.
And you've already accepted the necessity.

As for the third of the definitions above, [that of "the present,"] suppose
someone comes and makes the following claim:
Consider the cause of a water pitcher.
It is so something which is present-time in the time of the water pitcher,
Because it is something which, in the time of the water pitcher, has
begun and not yet stopped.
It is so, because it is both (1) something which has begun in the time of
the water pitcher and (2) something which has not stopped in
that time.

RANG RES RTAGS DANG PO MA GRUB BYAS PAR, DE CHOS CAN, DE'I DUS SU SKYES PA YIN PAR THAL, DE'I DUS SU SKYES ZIN PA'I PHYIR NA, MA KHYAB,
Our side would answer that the first part of this reason is not correct.
And then the other side would come back with,
Consider then this same thing.
It is too something which has begun in the time of the water pitcher,
Because it is something which has finished beginning in that time.
To this we'd answer, "It doesn't necessarily follow."

Here next is an analysis of the question of whether the past and the future
exist or not. Generally speaking there exist no definitions for "the past" or "the
future," because the past and future are not things which even exist. This is
because, anything which can be established as existing must always be existing
in the present [according to this school of Buddhism].

If though we were to establish the meaning of "the past" relative to a specific
point of reference, we could say that the definition of its past relative to the
time of a specific water pitcher could be given as follows:
Something which has, by the time of the water pitcher, already
started; and which has, by the time of the water pitcher, already
ended as well.
This and "the pitcher just before the pitcher" amount to the same thing.

The definition of its present relative to the time of a specific water pitcher then
could be given as follows:
That one thing which is both (1) something which has already
come into existence by the time of the water pitcher; and (2)
which is simultaneous to the water pitcher.

The definition of its future relative to the time of a specific water pitcher,
finally, could be given as follows:
That one thing which is both (1) in the act of starting at the time
of the water pitcher; and (2) not yet started at the time of the
water pitcher.

BUM PA'I MA 'ONGS PA, BUM PA'I RGYU, BUM PA'I DUS SU 'DAS PA, BUM PA LA LTOS TE 'DAS PA RNAMS DON 
The following all amount to the same thing:
the not-yet-coming of the water pitcher;
the cause of the water pitcher;
its past at the time of the water pitcher; and
its past relative to the water pitcher.
[Translator's note: "Not-yet-coming" and "future" are the same word in Tibetan (ma-

its future relative to the water pitcher.

These assertions [about the nature of time] are all presented in accordance with
the beliefs of the "Logician" group within the Sutrist School. They would not
necessarily be acceptable to any other school of Buddhism. The Detailists, for
example, do accept ideas such as past karma and future karma, while the
Necessity group entertains unimaginably profound positions such as the one
that states that the destruction of something is a working thing.

Formal logic subject:
A Discussion of Incorrect Logical Statements
The following presentation on incorrect "logical" statements is excerpted from An
Explanation of the Art of Reasoning (rTags-rigs), by the Tutor of His Holiness the
Thirteenth Dalai Lama, Purbuchok Jampa Tsultrim Gyatso (1825-1901).

,GNYIS PA RTAGS YANG DAG GI LOG PHYOGS GTAN TSIGS LTAR SNANG BSHAD PA LA, MTSAN NYID DANG , DBYE BA GNYIS, DANG PO LA, DGAG BZHAG GNYIS LAS, DANG PO LA, KHA CIG GIS TSUL GSUM MA YIN PA, GTAN TSIGS LTAR SNANG GI MTSAN NYID ZER NA,
Here is the second major division of our presentation, in which we explain the
opposite of a correct reason: that is, incorrect reasons. We proceed in two
steps: the definition of such reasons, and their various divisions.
The first of these we'll discuss in terms of disproving our opponent's beliefs,
and then establishing our own beliefs. Here is the first.

Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
"Any reason where the three relationships fail to hold" is the
definition of an incorrect reason.

MI 'THAD DE, GTAN TSIGS LTAR SNANG MED PA'I PHYIR TE, GZHI GRUB NA, RTAGS YANG DAG YIN PAS KHYAB PA'I PHYIR,
This though is mistaken, for there is no such thing as an incorrect reason:
everything which exists is a correct reason [to prove something].

GNYIS PA RANG LUGS NI, DE SGRUB KYI TSUL GSUM MA YIN PA, DE SGRUB KYI GTAN TSIGS LTAR SNANG GI MTSAN NYID,
Here secondly is our own position. The definition of an incorrect reason for
a particular proof is:
A reason for a particular proof where the three relationships fail
to hold.

GNYIS PA DBYE BA BSHAD PA NI, SPYIR GTAN TSIGS LTAR SNANG MED KYANG , GZHI LA SBYAR NA, DE SGRUB KYI 'GAL BA'I GTAN TSIGS, MA NGES PA'I GTAN TSIGS, MA GRUB PA'I GTAN TSIG DANG GSUM, DANG PO LA, MTSAN NYID, DBYE BA, MTSAN GZHI SGRUB BYED KYI RIGS PA 'GOD PA DANG BZHI,
Here secondly are the various divisions of incorrect reasons. Although there
is not, generally speaking, any such thing as an incorrect reason, we can say
that there do exist the following types of incorrect reasons in specific contexts:
1) Contradictory reasons for specific proofs;
2) Indefinite reasons for specfic proofs; and
3) Wrong reasons for specific proofs.
We will discuss the first of these in four steps: definition; divisions; classical
examples; and supporting arguments.

DANG PO NI, SGRA RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I PHYOGS CHOS KYANG YIN, SGRA RTAG PA MA YIN PAR SGRUB PA'I RJES KHYAB KYANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN PA DE, SGRA RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I 'GAL RTAGS KYI MTSAN NYID,
Here is the first. The definition of a contradictory reason for proving that
sound is an unchanging thing is:
That one thing for which (1) the relationship between the subject
and the reason does hold for proving that sound is an
unchanging thing; and (2) the positive necessity between the
reason and the quality to be proven also holds for proving that
sound is not an unchanging thing.
[A classical example would be: Consider sound. It is an unchanging thing,
because it is a made thing.]

GNYIS PA DBYE BA NI, MI MTHUN PHYOGS LA KHYAB BYED DU 'JUG PA'I 'GAL RTAGS DANG , MI MTHUN PHYOGS LA RNAM GNYIS SU 'JUG PA'I 'GAL RTAGS GNYIS,
Here secondly are the divisions.
Contradictory reasons can be divided into two kinds: those which have a
relationship with the group of dissimilar cases where they cover it completely,
and those which have a relationship with the group of dissimilar cases where
they go both ways, [covering or not].

GSUM PA MTSAN GZHI NI, BYAS PA SGRA MI RTAG PA MA YIN PAR SGRUB PA'I MI MTHUN PHYOGS LA KHYAB BYED DU 'JUG PA'I 'GAL RTAGS DANG , BYAS PA'I BYE BRAG DE SGRUB KYI MI MTHUN PHYOGS LA RNAM GNYIS SU 'JUG PA'I 'GAL RTAGS YIN,
Here thirdly are the classical examples. "Something that was made" is a
contradictory reason which has a relationship with the group of dissimilar
cases where they cover it completely, in a proof that sound is not a changing
thing. "Something which is a particular example of the general type called
'made things'" is a contradictory reason which has a relationship with the
group of dissimilar cases where they go both ways, in proving the same thing.

BZHI PA SGRUB BYED 'GOD PA NI, BYAS PA CHOS CAN, SGRA MI RTAG PA MA YIN PAR SGRUB PA'I MI MTHUN PHYOGS LA KHYAB BYED DU 'JUG PA'I 'GAL RTAGS YIN PAR THAL, DE SGRUB KYI 'GAL RTAGS YIN PA GANG ZHIG, MI RTAG PA YIN NA, KHYOD YIN PAS KHYAB PA'I PHYIR,
Next is the fourth category: the supporting arguments.
Consider "something that was made."
It is so a contradictory reason which has a relationship with the group of
dissimilar cases where they cover it completely, in a proof that sound
is not a changing thing,
Because it is both (1) a contradictory reason for proving this particular thing,
and (2) anything which is changing is also it.

BYAS PA'I BYE BRAG CHOS CAN, SGRA MI RTAG PA MA YIN PAR SGRUB PA'I 'GAL RTAGS YIN PAR THAL, SGRA RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I 'GAL RTAGS YIN PA'I PHYIR TE, DE SGRUB KYI PHYOGS CHOS GANG ZHIG, KHYOD KYI RTAGS KYIS DE SGRUB KYI RJES KHYAB PHYIN CI LOG TU NGES PA'I PHYIR,
And consider "something which is a particular example of the general type
called 'made things'."
It is so a contradictory reason which has a relationship with the group of
dissimilar cases where they go both ways, in a proof that sound is not
a changing thing,
Because it is a contradictory reason for proving that sound is an unchanging
thing.
And this is so because (1) the relationship between this reason and the subject
of the particular proof holds; and (2) it is definitely the case that the
positive necessity between it and the quality to be proven is
diametrically false.

GZHAN YANG , DE CHOS CAN, SGRA RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I 'GAL RTAGS YIN PAR THAL, SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Consider, moreover, this same example.
It is so a contradictory reason for proving that sound is an unchanging thing,
Because it is a correct reason for proving that sound is a changing thing.

Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
So does there exist then a contradictory reason for proving that sound
is a changing thing?
Because there does exist a contradictory reason for proving that sound
is an unchanging thing.
To this we answer, "It doesn't necessarily follow."

And you could never agree [that there did exist a contradictory reason for
proving that sound is a changing thing],
Because anything which is an incorrect reason for proving that sound is a
changing thing must be either (1) an indefinite reason for the particular
proof or (2) a wrong reason for the particular proof.

Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:

If there exist the three relationships for any particular proof, then there
must exist a correct reason for the particular proof.

SHES BYA CHOS CAN, SGRA RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG YOD PAR THAL, SGRA RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I TSUL GSUM YOD PA'I PHYIR,
Consider all knowable things.
There must then exist a correct reason for proving that sound is an unchanging
thing,
Because the three relationships do exist for proving that sound is an
unchanging thing.

KHYAB PA KHAS, MA GRUB NA, DER THAL, DE SGRUB KYI PHYOGS CHOS YOD PA GANG ZHIG, DE SGRUB KYI RJES KHYAB YOD, DE SGRUB KYI LDOG KHYAB YOD PA'I PHYIR,
You've already accepted that it necessarily follows.
Suppose then that you say that it's not correct [that the three relationships do
exist for proving that sound is an unchanging thing].
They do too exist, because (1) there exists a relationship between the reason
and the subject for this particular proof, and (2) there exists the positive
necessity for the proof, and there exists the reverse necessity for the
proof.

DANG PO GRUB STE, BYAS PA DE SGRA RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I PHYOGS CHOS YIN PA'I PHYIR,
The first part of our reason here is correct, because the relationship between
the reason and the subject holds when "something made" is used as the reason
in a proof that sound is an unchanging thing.

MA GRUB NA, DE CHOS CAN, DER THAL, DE SGRUB KYI 'GAL RTAGS YIN PA'I PHYIR TE, SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Suppose you say that it's not correct [that the relationship between the reason
and the subject holds when "something made" is used as the reason in
a proof that sound is an unchanging thing].
Consider this same thing [that is, "something made"].
The relationship does too hold with it,

Because it is a contradictory reason for the particular proof.
And that's true because it is a correct reason for proving that sound is a
changing thing.

GNYIS PA GRUB STE, CHOS DANG SKAD CIG MA MA YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN PA DE, SGRA RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I RJES KHYAB YIN PA'I PHYIR,
And the second reason is a correct one, because that one thing which is both
an existing phenomenon and something which is not momentary satisfies the
positive necessity in a proof that sound is an unchanging thing.

MA GRUB NA, DE CHOS CAN, DER THAL, KHYOD KYI RTAGS KYIS DE SGRUB KYI RTAGS CHOS GNYIS LDAN GYI MTHUN DPE YANG DAG YOD PA GANG ZHIG, KHYOD SGRA RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I MTHUN PHYOGS KHO NA LA 'GOD TSUL DANG MTHUN PAR YOD PA NYID DU TSAD MAS NGES PA'I PHYIR,
Suppose you say that this is not correct.
Consider this same thing [that one thing which is both an existing
phenomenon and something which is not momentary].
It does too [satisfy the relationship of positive necessity],
Because (1) there does exist a correct similar example which covers both the
reason and the quality to be proven, in this particular proof where that
"one thing" we mentioned is used as the reason; and (2) this "one thing"
can be verified, through a valid perception, as something that fits only
the group of similar cases, in the way it is stated, within a proof that
sound is an unchanging thing.

DANG PO GRUB STE, 'DUS MA BYAS KYI NAM MKHA' DE, KHYOD KYI RTAGS KYIS DE SGRUB KYI RTAGS CHOS GNYIS LDAN GYI MTHUN DPE YANG DAG YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Now the first part of our reason is correct, because "unproduced, empty space"
would be a correct similar example which covers both the reason and
the quality to be proven in this particular proof, where the "one thing"
we mentioned is used as a reason.

GNYIS PA GRUB STE, KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS KHO NA LA 'GOD TSUL DANG MTHUN PAR YOD PA'I PHYIR TE, KHYOD RTAG PA'I MTSAN NYID YIN PA'I PHYIR,
And the second part of our reason is correct, because "that one thing which is
both an existing phenomenon and something which is not momentary"
is something that fits only the group of similar cases, in the way it is
stated, within this particular proof.
And this is because it is, in fact, the definition of something which is
unchanging.

GONG GI GSUM PA GRUB STE, CHOS DANG SKAD CIG MA MA YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN PA DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
The third part of our reason above, [that there exists the reverse necessity for
the proof,] is also correct. This is because that one thing which is both (1) an
existing phenomenon and (2) something which is not momentary fulfils that
same necessity.

MA GRUB NA, DE CHOS CAN, SGRA RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I LDOG KHYAB YIN PAR THAL, KHYOD KYI RTAGS KYIS DE SGRUB KYI RTAGS CHOS GNYIS DANG MI LDAN PA'I MI MTHUN DPE YANG DAG YOD, KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI MI MTHUN PHYOGS LA MED PA KHO NAR TSAD MAS NGES PA'I PHYIR,
Now suppose you say that our last reason is not correct.
Consider this same thing [that is, that one thing which is both (1) an existing
phenomenon and (2) something which is not momentary].
It does so fulfil the reverse necessity for the proof that sound is an unchanging
thing,
Because there does exist a correct dissimilar example for the proof in which it
serves as the reason; that is, an example which possesses neither the
reason nor the quality to be proven for the particular proof. And it can
also be verified, through a valid perception, that it only does not fit the
group of dissimilar cases for the proof.

RTZA BAR 'DOD NA, SGRA CHOS CAN, KHYOD RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG MED PAR 
THAL, KHYOD RTAG PA MA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Suppose finally that you agree to the original statement: [that is, you agree that
there must exist a correct reason for proving that sound is an unchanging
thing].
Consider then sound.
It is rather so, that there exists no correct reason for proving that sound is an
unchanging thing;
Because it is not something which is unchanging.

Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
It must then be so, that there is something for which all three
relationships hold, in proving that sound is an unchanging thing;
Because there is something which fulfils the relationship between the
subject and the reason for this proof; and there is something
which fulfils the positive necessity for the proof; and there is
something which fulfils the reverse necessity for the proof.
To this we reply, "It doesn't necessarily follow."

MTSAN NYID,
Here secondly is our explanation of an indefinite reason; we will proceed first
with a definition, and then with the various divisions of this reason. Here is
the first of these.
The following is the definition of an indefinite reason for proving that sound
is an unchanging thing:
That one thing for which (1) the relationship between the subject
and the reason for proving that sound is an unchanging thing
does hold; (2) the reverse relationship between the reason and the
subject for proving that sound is an unchanging thing does not
hold; and (3) the reverse relationship between the reason and the
subject for proving that sound is not an unchanging thing doesn't
hold either.
[A classical example would be: Consider sound. It is an unchanging thing,
because there is no such thing as antlers on a rabbit's head.]

Here secondly are the divisions. This kind of reason can be divided into two:
unique indefinite reasons for a particular proof, and common indefinite reasons
for a particular proof. We will discuss the first of these two in two steps: its
definition, and a classical example for it.

DANG PO NI, KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI MA NGES PA'I GTAN TSIGS GANG ZHIG, KHYOD DE SGRUB PA LA PHYOGS CHOS CAN DU SONG BA'I GANG ZAG GIS, KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS LA YOD PAR MA NGES PA YANG YIN, GANG ZAG DES KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI MI MTHUN PHYOGS LA YOD PAR MA NGES PA YANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN PA DE, KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI THUN MONG MA YIN PA'I MA NGES PA'I GTAN TSIGS YIN PA'I MTSAN NYID,
Here is the first. The definition of something which is a unique indefinite
reason for a particular proof is:
That one thing which is both (1) an indefinite reason for a
particular proof; and (2) such that a person who already
recognizes that it fulfils the relationship between the subject and
the reason for the particular proof has yet to verify either one of
the following: that it fits the group of similar cases for the proof,
or that it fits the group of dissimilar cases for the proof.

Here secondly are some classical examples.
The following are all both unique indefinite reasons for proving that sound is
an unchanging thing, and unique indefinite reasons for proving that sound is
a changing thing:
something you can hear;
the reverse of all that is not sound; and
the reversal of sound.

GNYIS PA THUN MONG BA'I MA NGES PA'I GTAN TSIGS LA, MTSAN NYID, DBYE BA GNYIS LAS, DANG PO NI, KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI MA NGES PA'I GTAN TSIGS GANG ZHIG, KHYOD DE SGRUB PA LA PHYOGS CHOS CAN DU SONG BA'I GANG ZAG GIS KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS LA YOD PAR NGES PA DANG , GANG ZAG DES DE SGRUB KYI MI MTHUN PHYOGS LA YOD PAR NGES PA GANG RUNG YANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN PA DE, KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI THUN MONG BA'I MA NGES PA'I GTAN TSIGS KYI MTSAN NYID,
We will discuss the second type, common indefinite reasons, in two steps as
well: definition, and divisions. Here is the first.
The definition of a common indefinite reason is:
That one thing which is both (1) an indefinite reason for a
particular proof; and (2) such that a person who already
recognizes that it fulfils the relationship between the subject and
the reason for the particular proof has either verified (a) that it
fits the group of similar cases for the proof, or (b) that it fits the
group of dissimilar cases for the proof.

Here is the second. These types of reasons may be divided into three: those
which are direct indefinite reasons for a particular proof; those which are
uncertain indefinite reasons for a particular proof; and those indefinite reasons
which are neither of the first two. Again we will discuss the first of these in
terms of its definition and its divisions.

DANG PO NI, KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI MA NGES PA'I GTAN TSIGS GANG ZHIG, KHYOD DE SGRUB PA LA PHYOGS CHOS CAN DU SONG PA'I GANG ZAG GIS, KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS DANG , MI MTHUN PHYOGS GNYIS KA LA YOD PAR NGES PA DE, KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI DNGOS KYI MA NGES PA'I GTAN TSIGS YIN PA'I MTSAN NYID,
Here is the first. The definition of something which is a direct indefinite
reason is:
That one thing which is both (1) an indefinite reason for a
particular proof; and (2) such that a person who already
recognizes that it fulfils the relationship between the subject and
the reason for the particular proof has verified that it fits both the
group of similar cases and the group of dissimilar cases for the
proof.

Here secondly are the divisions of this type of reason. They come in four
different types:
1) Those direct indefinite reasons that cover both the group of similar
cases and the group of dissimilar cases for the particular proof;
2) Those same kinds of reasons that cover the group of similar cases for
the particular proof, but which go both ways as far as its group
of dissimilar cases;
3) Those same kinds of reasons that cover the group of dissimilar cases
for the particular proof, but which go both ways as far as its
group of similar cases; and
4) Those same kinds of reasons that go both ways as far as both the
group of dissimilar cases and the group of similar cases for the
particular proof.

Here are respective classical examples for each of these types.
1) The fact that there are no such things as rabbit antlers would be a direct
indefinite reason that covers both the group of similar cases in a proof that
sound is an unchanging thing, and the group of dissimilar cases for this same
proof.

2) "Changing thing" would be a direct indefinite reason that covers the group
of similar cases in a proof that the sound of a conch shell is something
produced through a conscious effort, but which goes both ways as far as the
group of dissimilar cases for this same proof.

MI RTAG PA DE, DUNG SGRA RTZOL BYUNG MA YIN PAR SGRUB PA'I MI MTHUN PHYOGS LA KHYAB BYED DANG , MTHUN PHYOGS LA RNAM GNYIS SU 'JUG PA'I DE DANG ,
3) "Changing thing" would be a direct indefinite reason that covers the group
of dissimilar cases in a proof that sound of a conch shell is not something
produced through a conscious effort, but which goes both ways as far as its
group of similar cases.

4) "Sense consciousness" would be a direct indefinite reason that goes both
ways as far as both the group of dissimilar cases and the group of similar cases
in a proof that a sense consciousness which thinks there are two moons [where
there is only one] is a direct [valid] perception.

Here secondly is our discussion of uncertain indefinite reasons; we will repeat
the two steps of their definition and their divisions. Here is the first.
The definition of something's being an uncertain indefinite reason for a
particular proof is the following:
That one thing which is both (1) a common indefinite reason for
a particular proof; and (2) such that a person who already
recognizes that it fulfils the relationship between the subject and
the reason for the particular proof has either (a) already verified
that it fits the group of similar cases for the proof, but is still
uncertain whether it fits the group of dissimilar cases for the
proof or not; or else (b) already verified that it does fit the group
of dissimilar cases for the proof, but is still uncertain whether it
fits the group of similar cases for the proof or not.

GNYIS PA DBYE BA NI, YANG DAG LHAG LDAN GYI MA NGES PA'I GTAN TSIGS DANG , 'GAL BA LHAG LDAN GYI MA NGES PA'I GTAN TSIGS GNYIS LAS,
Here secondly are the divisions of this type of reason. There are two: correct
uncertain indefinite reasons and contradictory uncertain indefinite reasons.

The definition of something's being a correct uncertain indefinite reason for a
particular proof is:
That one thing which is both (1) an uncertain indefinite reason
for a particular proof; and (2) such that a person who already
recognizes that it fulfils the relationship between the subject and

the reason for the particular proof has already verified that it fits
the group of similar cases for the proof, but is still uncertain
whether it fits the group of dissimilar cases for the proof or not.

The definition of something's being a contradictory uncertain indefinite reason
for a particular proof is:
That one thing which is both (1) an uncertain indefinite reason
for a particular proof; and (2) such that a person who already
recognizes that it fulfils the relationship between the subject and
the reason for the particular proof has already verified that it fits
the group of dissimilar cases for the proof, but is still uncertain
whether it fits the group of similar cases for the proof or not.

Here are some examples, in the order we gave the definitions. An example of
the first would be giving "because he is making pronouncements" as a reason
for proving that John, who is making pronouncements, is not an omniscient
being--and giving this reason to someone who doubts the existence of an
omniscient being.

YANG DE DE'I NGOR NGAG SMRA BA'I LHAS SPYIN KUN MKHYEN DU SGRUB PA'I GNYIS PA YIN,
The same reason presented to the same person to prove that John, who is
making pronouncements, is an omniscient being would be an example of the
second type.

Here thirdly we'll explain those common indefinite reasons which are neither
the direct nor uncertain types. Again we proceed in terms of definition and
classical example.

Here is the first. The definition of something being a common indefinite
reason which is neither the direct nor the uncertain types for a particular proof
is:
That one thing which is both (1) a common indefinite reason for
a particular proof; and (2) such that a person who already
recognizes that it fulfils the relationship between the subject and
the reason for the particular proof has already verified either that
it fits only the group of similar cases for the proof, or that it only
doesn't fit the group of dissimilar cases for the proof.

Here secondly is our classical example. "[Because there is a] taste of sugar in
the present time" is a common indefinite reason which is neither the direct nor
the uncertain types in a proof that a lump of sugar in one's mouth has the
visible appearance of a lump of sugar in the present time.

Here third is our presentation on wrong reasons. Again we proceed in two
steps of definition and divisions. Here is the first.
The definition of a wrong reason for any particular proof is:
That which (1) has been put forth as a reason for a particular
proof, but (2) for which the relationship between the subject and
the reason does not hold.

GNYIS PA DBYE BA LA, DON LA LTOS NAS MA GRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS, BLO LA LTOS NAS MA GRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS, RGOL BA LA LTOS NAS MA GRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS DANG GSUM LAS,
Here secondly are the divisions of wrong reasons for particular proofs. There
are three different types:
1) Reasons which are wrong relative to meaning.
2) Reasons which are wrong relative to a state of mind.
3) Reasons which are wrong relative to the particular opponent.

DANG PO LA, RTAGS KYI NGO BO MED NAS MA GRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS, CHOS CAN GYI NGO BO MED NAS MA GRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS, RTAGS CHOS THA DAD MED NAS MA GRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS, GZHI RTAGS THA DAD MED NAS MA GRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS, GZHI CHOS THA DAD MED NAS MA GRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS, RTAGS SHES 'DOD CHOS CAN GYI STENG DU 'GONG TSUL DANG MTHUN PAR MED NAS MA GRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS, GTAN TSIGS KYI PHYOGS GCIG SHES 'DOD CHOS CAN LA MED NAS MA GRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS DANG BDUN,
MTSAN GZHI RIM PA LTAR,
The first of these may itself be divided into seven different types:
1) Reasons which are wrong because the very nature of the reason is
non-existent.
2) Reasons which are wrong because the very nature of the subject is
non-existent.
3) Reasons which are wrong because the reason and the quality to be
proven are indistinguishable from one another.
4) Reasons which are wrong because the subject and the reason are
indistinguishable from one another.
5) Reasons which are wrong because the subject and the quality to be
proven are indistinguishable from one another.
6) Reasons which are wrong because the reason does not pertain to the
subject in the way it has been said to in the statement of the
proof.
7) Reasons which are wrong because some part of the reason fails to
belong to the subject under consideration.
The following are respective examples of these types of reasons, in particular
proofs:

This brings us to the second kind of wrong reason: the one that is wrong
relative to a state of mind. Here there are four different types:
1) Reasons that are wrong because the opponent entertains doubt about
the very nature of the reason.
2) Reasons that are wrong because the opponent entertains doubt about
the very nature of the subject.
3) Reasons that are wrong because the opponent entertains doubt about
the connection between the subject and the reason.
4) Reasons that are wrong because there is nothing that the opponent
has yet to understand.
The following are respective examples of these four, for particular proofs.

Here thirdly is our explanation of reasons which are wrong relative to the
particular opponent. There are three different kinds of these reasons:
1) Reasons which are wrong relative to the proponent.
2) Reasons which are wrong relative to the opponent.
3) Reasons which are wrong relative to both the opponent and the
proponent.
Here are respective examples for these three types of reasons, in particular
proofs.

***************
The forms of debate:
The traditional debate year
The following annual calendar for Sera Mey Tibetan Monastery gives a good picture
of the schedule of study followed by all monks in the geshe program at the monastery.
It is a traditional schedule which developed at the original Sera Mey in Lhasa, Tibet,
over the centuries; since the rebuilding of Sera Mey in south India, the schedule has
been reinstated--with a certain number of variations from the one used in Tibet--and
is now followed closely, with some exceptions due to the need to work in the monastery
cornfields and so on. Below is a translation of the annual calendar as it is currently
posted on at the main temple of the monastery; the notes and some amendations to the
calendar were completed with the help of Khen Rinpoche Geshe Lobsang Tharchin, a
former abbot of the monastery.
_______________
Annual Calendar of Debates,
Examinations, and Other Special Events
at Sera Mey Tibetan Monastery
Bylakuppe, South India
Schedule of Regular Dharma Sessions
The following are the eight traditional "dharma sessions" (chos-thog) that make up
the standard periods of monastic study at Sera Mey Monastery. The first Tibetan
month, by the way, normally falls in February or March of the western calendar. The
dates below are the same for any given year, independent of the day of the week, and
follow the waxing and waning of the moon.
Session One: The Earlier Dharma Session of Spring (dPyid-chos dang-po)

Starting assembly: 26th of the first Tibetan month
First firewood break: 27th and 28th of the first Tibetan month
The "firewood break" (shing-slong), or literally "time for requesting firewood
from sponsors" follows immediately after the starting assembly (yar-tsogs).
This assembly features prayers for the success of the session, and is attended
by all monks who intend to participate for this period. It is also during this
assembly that young monks who have been deemed ready by the abbot, the
debate master, and their house teacher undergo the ceremony of intitiation into
the debate park. These "newbies" are known as sarshuk (gsar-zhugs), or
"newly entered." They are expected to demonstrate their commitment to the
debate session through perfect attendance, and especially serious study and
debate, for the entire length of the session.
In Lhasa, a head-count was taken during the starting assembly in order to
determine the cooking and other needs. During the next two days, teams of
monks would go out to help find firewood for the monastery kitchen, based on
the head-count.
The first day of the firewood break was devoted to visiting lay communities in
the countryside outside of Lhasa city to ask for firewood; families in these
villages knew what day to expect the monks, and considered it an honor to
prepare a good supply of wood in advance. On the second day the monks
would travel to Lhasa city proper to request fuel. This supply of wood would
have to last about two weeks, until the "mid-term firewood break" (rked-pa'i
shing-slong).
Great debate examinations: tsokrampa geshe examinations, 28th to the 30th of
the first Tibetan month
During specific sessions, intense debate examinations are held for candidates
standing for various degrees at the monastery. The most well known of these
degree titles is the geshe. The word "geshe" (kaly a mitra in Sanskrit, or
dge-bshes in Tibetan) literally means "spiritual friend," and is a term from
the earliest days of Buddhism in India. Later, great masters among the first
Tibetan Buddhists--the Kadampas--were called "geshe" out of respect for their
learning and high level of practice.
As monastic institutions began to form in Tibet, the word "geshe" came to be
used as a title. It was originally used in the early "Big Three" monasteries of
Sangpu (gSang-phu), Kyormo Lung (sKyor-mo lung), and Gadong (sGa-
gdong). Sangpu, for example, was founded around the middle of the eleventh
century.

Sangpu had two colleges within the confines (or gseb) of the monastery as a
whole (known as the gling); early geshe candidates had to make their debate
defense at a combined assembly of the two, and came to be known as lingse
geshes, a corruption of the word lingsep (gling-gseb). The Great Dictionary
of the Tibetan Language and other sources take the word lingse to mean
gling-bsre, or a defense before the "combined" (bsre) assemblies of the two
colleges in the monastery (gling). In either case, the point is the same.
At Sera Mey, there are typically four lingse geshe degrees conferred per year:
these come in two pairs known as the "summer lingse" and the "winter
lingse." Geshes of this rank go through an examination process within their
own monastery, as described in a previous reading for this course. During
some of their defenses, these and other geshe candidates are required to provide
an elaborate series of refreshments, involving some served to the entire
assembly of their monastery. This ceremony is known as the "Thirteen-Course
Tea and Broth" (Ja-thug bcu-gsum).
During other defenses, lingse candidates need only provide a series of ten tea
offerings on the day when they undergo a special part of their examination
which involves reciting a great many pages of scripture from memory. This
test is called a geshe shepa (dge-bshes bshad-pa); and since the major
refreshments of tea and broth are not served to the entire assembly this time,
the presentation is known as a "dry recitation" (skam-bshad).
Below the rank of lingse geshe is the rikrampa (rigs rams-pa), and the next
higher rank after the lingse is the tsokrampa (tsogs rams-pa). In both cases,
the word rampa refers to the veritable myriad (rab-'byams, shortened to
rams-pa) number of great Buddhist classics that a geshe must master. The
word tsok in tsokrampa refers to the Session of the Great Assembly (Tsogs-
chos), an annual meeting in Lhasa city of the six great colleges. Here there
are two each for the "Great Three" monasteries of later times: Sera, Ganden,
and Drepung, all founded around the opening of the fifteenth century.
Representatives from Deyang (bDe-yangs) monastery would also attend this
gathering, during which the candidates for the tsokrampa rank would have to
defend their knowledge.
The Great Assembly traditionally began on the 20th of the second Tibetan
month, and ended on the 30th. This is the time it would take to complete the
examination of one or two tsokrampa candidates from each college per year.
Candidates for the highest rank of geshe, the hlarampa (hla rams-pa), are
examined during the Great Prayer Festival, or Munlam Chenmo. This festival
was instituted by Je Tsongkapa in the 15th century as a great dharma
celebration for the New Year. Since it was held in the capital city of Lhasa

(Hla-sa), these geshes became known as hlarampa. Each of the six colleges
normally nominates two candidates per year for the rank of hlarampa,
although on some occasions it may be as many as four.
First actual debate session: begins 1st of the second Tibetan month
Mid-term firewood break: 5th and 6th of the second Tibetan month
Second actual debate session: begins 7th of the second Tibetan month
Auspicious conclusion: 18th of the second Tibetan month
The "Auspicious Conclusion" (Shis-brjod) is a day of prayer and celebration
for the successful end of another dharma session; it is marked by special
recitations known as "pronouncing" (brjod) the "auspiciousness" (bkra-shis,
the "trashi" in "trashi delek"). These prayers are done in a unique melody or
yang (dbyangs). On this day too, the abbot of the monastery will often
deliver a special dharma teaching.
Intersession break (Chos-mtsams):
19th of the second Tibetan month to the 7th of the third Tibetan month
Session Two: The Great Dharma Session of Spring (dPyid-chos chen-mo)
Starting assembly: 8th of the third Tibetan month
First firewood break: 9th and 10th of the third Tibetan month
Great debate examinations: summer lingse geshes, 11th to the 12th of the third
Tibetan month
First actual debate session: begins 13th of the third Tibetan month
Mid-term firewood break: 22nd and 23rd of the third Tibetan month
Second actual debate session: begins 24th of the third Tibetan month
Auspicious conclusion: 7th of the fourth Tibetan month
Intersession break: 8th of the fourth Tibetan month to the 16th of the fourth
Tibetan month
Session Three: The Earlier Summer Dharma Session (dByar-chos dang-po)
Starting assembly: 17th of the fourth Tibetan month
First firewood break: 18th and 19th of the fourth Tibetan month
Great debate examinations: (no geshe debates)
First actual debate session: begins 20th of the fourth Tibetan month
Mid-term firewood break: (none)
Second actual debate session: (none)

Auspicious conclusion: 1st of the fifth Tibetan month
Intersession break: 2nd of the fifth Tibetan month to the 16th of the fifth
Tibetan month
Session Four: The Great Dharma Session of Summer (dByar-chos chen-mo)
Starting assembly: 17th of the fifth Tibetan month
First firewood break: 18th and 19th of the fifth Tibetan month
Great debate examinations: summer lingse geshes ("dry recitation") and rikram
geshes; 20th to the 23rd of the fifth Tibetan month
First actual debate session: begins 24th of the fifth Tibetan month
Mid-term firewood break: 2nd and 3rd of the sixth Tibetan month
Second actual debate session: begins 4th of the sixth Tibetan month
Auspicious conclusion: 15th of the sixth Tibetan month
Intersession break: 16th of the sixth Tibetan month to the 16th of the seventh
Tibetan month; includes rikram geshe exams, summer lingse geshe
exams, rikchung pre-geshe exams, and rikdra inter-monastic debates
The rikdra (rigs-grva) inter-monastic debates begin on the last day of the sixth
Tibetan month and last until the 15th day of the seventh Tibetan month. During this
time, thirty debaters from Sera Mey debate with thirty counterparts from the sister
monastery of Sera Jey in the main assembly hall (tsogs-chen) shared by both
monasteries for major events such as the biweekly monks' purification ceremony, or
sojong (gso-sbyong).
During this time, pairs of debaters match off twice a day, once in the morning and
once in the evening, for fifteen days. In a typical session, the proponent (snga-rgol)
will be responsible for a lengthy recitation of scripture from memory, after which his
opponent (phyi-rgol) is charged with posing a difficult series of formalized debate
questions. In Tibet, the combined monasteries of Sera Mey and Sera Jey had joint
holdings of property, and the income from these would be used during this session to
supply all the monks attending with gifts of Tibetan pastries (kabse) and roasted
barley flour, or tsampa.
It is also during this time that the rikchen (rigs-chen), or advanced pre-geshe debates,
are held. Here a student who intends to take a higher geshe degree engages in a
difficult and highly formalized debate against a similar candidate from the sister
monastery. Other students in the monastery during this time are engaged in special
examinations, administered by the abbot and debate master of their home monastery,
during which they are required to recite, from memory, about 100 pages of scripture.

Session Five: The Water Dharma Session (Chab-zhugs chos-thog)
Starting assembly: 17th of the seventh Tibetan month
First firewood break: 18th and 19th of the seventh Tibetan month
Great debate examinations: (no geshe debates)
First actual debate session: begins 20th of the seventh Tibetan month
Mid-term firewood break: (none)
Second actual debate session: (none)
Auspicious conclusion: 30th of the seventh Tibetan month
The "Water" Session (Chab-zhugs) is possibly given this name due to the fact that,
during the period following the especially intense Great Session of Summer, students
in the geshe program finally have enough time to relax and "enter the water" (chab-
zhugs), or take a nice slow bath. The rikchung and rikchen (preliminary and
advanced pre-geshe debates) have been completed, as have the grueling rikdra inter-
monastic debates, and memorization exams. Students would be allowed take breaks
in special parks throughout out the monastery, and traditional folk-dance troupes
would come there at times, to perform the "goddess" plays (lha-mo).
Intersession break: 1st of the eighth Tibetan month to the 7th of the eighth
Tibetan month; this is the main "water break"
Session Six: The Dharma Session of Medicine Buddha (sMan-bla chos-thog)
Starting assembly: 8th of the eighth Tibetan month
First firewood break: 9th and 10th of the eighth Tibetan month
Great debate examinations: (no geshe debates)
First actual debate session: begins 11th of the eighth Tibetan month
Mid-term firewood break: 22nd and 23rd of the eighth Tibetan month
Second actual debate session: begins 24th of the eighth Tibetan month
Auspicious conclusion: 7th of the ninth Tibetan month
This session takes its name from the fact that an extensive Medicine Buddha rite is
held on the 11th of the eighth month.
Intersession break: 8th of the ninth Tibetan month to the 16th of the ninth
Tibetan month
Session Seven: The Great Dharma Session of Autumn (sTon-chos chen-mo)

Mid-term firewood break: 2nd and 3rd of the tenth Tibetan month
Second actual debate session: begins 4th of the tenth Tibetan month
Auspicious conclusion: 16th of the tenth Tibetan month
Intersession break: 17th of the tenth Tibetan month to the 16th of the eleventh
Tibetan month
Session Eight: The Great Dharma Session of Winter (dGun-chos chen-mo)
Starting assembly: 17th of the eleventh Tibetan month
First firewood break: 18th and 19th of the eleventh Tibetan month
The great examinations: 20th to the 23rd of the eleventh Tibetan month; debate
examinations for the winter lingse geshes and hlarampa geshes, the
former presenting their "dry recitation"
First actual debate session: begins 24th of the eleventh Tibetan month
Mid-term firewood break: 12th and 13th of the twelfth Tibetan month
Second actual debate session: begins 14th of the twelfth Tibetan month
Auspicious conclusion: 16th of the twelfth Tibetan month

This break features further examination of winter lingse geshes, the Tibetan
New Year, and the Great Prayer Festival; it begins on the 17th of the twelfth
Tibetan month and ends on the 25th of the first Tibetan month.
Annual Special Events
Passing On of Kedrup Tenpa Dargye (mKhas-grub dgongs-rdzogs)
14th day of the fifth Tibetan month
Kedrup Tenpa Dargye (1493-1568) was an illustrious scholar from Sera Mey who
wrote many of the monastery's textbooks. On special days like this, the monastery
will be covered at night in strings of brightly colored electric lights that look like our
Christmas-tree lights.
Summer Offering to the Two Dharma Protectors (Chos-skyong rnam-gnyis
kyi dbyar-gsol)
15th day of the fifth Tibetan month

This particular day every year is known throughout Tibet as the "Day of
Auspiciousness throughout the World" ('Dzam-gling spyi-bzang). At Sera Mey, the
occasion is used as an opportunity to thank the dharma protectors of the monastery for
their help, and to request that they continue their sacred deeds. The two protectors
here are Chamsing (lCam-sring) and Taok (Tha-'og). The protector Chamsing is
shared with other monasteries, while Taok is a unique protector for Sera Mey. Please
note that these two protectors have nothing to do with the current dharma protector
controversy.
Rikchung (Pre-Geshe Degree) Debates
25th to the 28th of the sixth Tibetan month
First team
Proponent takes the subject "Turning of the Wheel," opponent takes
"Book of Maitreya": 25th of the sixth Tibetan month
Each of the subjects mentioned here are important topics from the
Ornament of Realizations, spoken to the realized being
Asanga by Lord Maitreya around 350 AD.
Second team
Proponent takes "Sutra and Commentary," opponent takes "Final
End": 26th of the sixth Tibetan month

Great Winter Examinations
8th of the eleventh Tibetan month

Assembly of the Great Offering Ceremony for the Prayer of Maitreya
(Byams-smon sgrub-mchod chen-mo yar-tsogs)
25th of the eleventh Tibetan month
Khen Rinpoche notes that, in Tibet, this entire ceremony took nearly a month. The
17th of the eleventh month marks the opening ceremony for the session, and is followed
by two days of a firewood break. The 20th and 21st are marked by the "dry
recitations" for the winter lingshe geshes, and then the next three days are
examinations for the hlarampa candidates. Finally, on the 25th, the actual prayer
begins: all of the monks together recite the entire relevant work by the Buddha from
memory. At Sera Jey, the recitation for this period is the Prayer of the Deeds of
Samanta Bhadra (bZang-spyod smon-lam), also by Lord Buddha. The Prayer of
Maitreya continues until the 13th of the twelfth Tibetan month.
Great Torma Offering of the Twenty-Ninth (dGu-gtor chen-mo)
29th of the twelfth Tibetan month
This is one of the year's biggest prayer ceremonies; the next day is the last day of the
year, the new (black) moon (gnam-gang).
Presentation of the Debate Ground Schedule (Chos-grvar tsogs-gtam 'bul-
yun)
16th of the third Tibetan month; 26th of the fifth Tibetan month; 16th of the
eighth Tibetan month; and 26th of the ninth Tibetan month
On these four dates of the year, the debate master (dge-bskos) stands in the assembly
of the debate park to announce the schedule for the coming period. He also outlines
the duties that different members of the monastery will be expected to fulfill during
this time, and reviews the general rule of behavior for the monastery from the
monastery constitution (rtza-khrims, also known as a bca'-yig). This document for
Sera Mey was written by His Holiness the Eighth Dalai Lama, Jampel Gyatso (1758-
1804); copies were very rare following the invasion of Tibet. A complete carving was
located and supplied to Sera Mey several years ago by Asian Classics Input Project
staff at the Oriental Library of the Russian Academy of Sciences in St Petersburg,
Russia.
