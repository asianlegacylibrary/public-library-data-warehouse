Contemplations on the Perfection of Patience
Contemplation One
Anger destroys good karma

,BSKAL PA STONG DU BSAGS PA YI,
,SBYIN DANG BDE GSHEGS MCHOD LA SOGS,
,LEGS SPYAD GANG YIN DE KUN YANG ,
,KHONG KHRO GCIG GIS 'JOMS PAR BYED,
A single instance of anger
Destroys whatever good deeds
You may have amassed in thousands
Of eons spent in practices
Like giving, or making offerings
To Those Who have Gone to Bliss.

,ZHE SDANG LTA BU'I SDIG PA MED,
,BZOD PA LTA BU'I DKA' THUB MED,
,DE BAS BZOD LA NAN TAN DU,
,SNA TSOGS TSUL DU BSGOM PAR BYA,
There is no kind of deed
As evil as the act of anger;
There is no spiritual hardship
Like patience. Practice it then,
Concentrate on patience,
In many different ways.

KHONG KHRO'I NYES DMIGS DANG , BZOD PA'I PHAN YON BSAM PA'O, , DANG PO LA GSUM, MA MTHONG BA'I NYES DMIGS DANG , MTHONG BA'I NYES DMIGS DANG , NYES DMIGS BSDUS TE BSTAN PA'O, , DANG PO LA GNYIS, KHONG KHROS DGE RTZA 'JOMS PA DANG , KHRO BA DANG BZOD PA'I SKYON YON SHES NAS BZOD PA BSGOM PA LA 'BAD PAR BYA BA'O, , DANG PO NI,
We must contemplate upon the problems that anger causes, and upon the
benefits that come from patience. The problems we will cover in three steps:
those that we cannot see, those that we can see, and then a summary of the
problems. The problems that we cannot see will be presented in two parts:
how anger destroys our store of good karma, and advice to make efforts in the
practice of patience, once we have learned well the problems of anger and the
corresponding benefits of patience. Here is the first.

DGE BA'I CHOS RNAMS SKYE BA DANG GNAS PA'I GEGS BYED MTHAR THUG PA KHONG KHRO YIN PAS DE'I NYES DMIGS BSAMS NAS DE 'GOG PA LA BRTZON PAR BYA STE, BSKAL PA BRGYA DANG STONG DU

Anger is the ultimate obstacle that prevents the initial growth and then
continuation of every virtuous thing. As such we should contemplate upon the
problems it brings to us, and then make great efforts to stop it. This is because
of its effects on whatever good deeds you may have amassed in hundreds or
thousands of eons spent in practices like giving, or making offerings to Those Who
have Gone to Bliss (or to any of the other members of the Three Jewels), or
meditating, or maintaining an ethical way of life. A single instance of anger
focused upon a bodhisattva destroys all this virtue, from the root.

,DER MA ZAD THAMS CAD YOD SMRA'I SDE PAS 'DON PA'I LUNG BSLAB BTUS SU DRANGS PA LAS, DGE SLONG GIS DE BZHIN GSHEGS PA'I DBU SKRA DANG SEN MO'I MCHOD RTEN LA SEMS DAD PAS PHYAG BYAS PA'I LUS KYIS JI TZAM NON PA'I GSER GYI 'KHOR LO LA THUG PA'I BAR GYI RDUL GYI GRANGS JI SNYED YOD PA STONG 'GYUR GYI 'KHOR LO BSGYUR BA THOB PA'I DGE BA DE TSANGS PA MTSUNGS PAR SPYOD PA LA RMA BYUNG BAS 'JOMS PAR GSUNGS SO, , KHONG KHROS BSKAL PA BRGYA DANG STONG DU BSAGS PA'I DGE RTZA GCOD PA'I KHONG KHRO'I YUL LA BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA' DGOS PAR GSUNGS SO, , DE BZHIN DU DBU MA LA 'JUG PA LAS KYANG BSHAD DO,
Beyond all this is a quotation found in the Compendium of the Trainings, one
which is recited by the Buddhist group known as "Those Who Profess Them
All":
Suppose a monk, heart filled with devotion, prostrates himself
before an offering shrine containing the holy hair or fingernails
of One Who has Gone Thus. Imagine the number of atoms
contained in the ground which his body covers, going all the way
down into the planet up to the point where it touches the disk of
gold. Then imagine that each of these atoms represents the
amount of good karma required to attain a birth as the Emperor

of the Wheel, the King of the World. Now multiply all that by
a thousand. This is the amount of good karma which you
destroy by speaking badly of one of those persons who is
maintaining the pure way of life--that is, an ordained person.
It is stated, by the way, that for an instance of anger to destroy the store of
good karma that one has amassed over hundreds or thousands of eons, it must
be anger which is focused at a particular object: that is, at a bodhisattva. This
same point is described in Entering the Middle Way.

,GNAS MAL GZHI'I MGO'I 'DUL BA RGYA CHER 'GREL LAS, KHONG KHROS SDOM PA GCOD PAR BSHAD PA NI, KHONG KHRO STOBS CAN GYIS DGE RTZA BCAD PA LA BZHED PAR GSAL LO, , GZHAN YANG RTOG GE 'BAR BAR LOG LTA DANG GNOD SEMS KYIS DGE RTZA 'JOMS PAR BSHAD PAS KHONG KHRO SOGS BSRUNG BA LA 'BAD PAR BYA'O,
In the opening section of the Monastic Practices relating to Arrangements for
Housing there is also a discussion of the statement in the Extensive Commentary
on Vowed Morality where it says that anger can destroy your vows. This
discussion clarifies the fact that the statement refers to the destruction of stores
of good karma by anger of tremendous intensity. It is moreover stated in the
Blaze of Reasoning that one's store of good karma can be destroyed by wrong
view and by malice. Given all this, we must make great efforts to shield our
minds from anger and the rest.

,GNYIS PA NI, LAM SKYE BA'I GEGS BYED PA DANG DGE BA 'JOMS PA LA ZHE SDANG LTA BU'I SDIG PA MED LA, NYON MONGS KYI TSA GDUNG 'JOMS PA LA BZOD PA LTA BU'I DKA' THUB MED PA DE BAS NA BZOD PA BSGOM PA LA NAN TAN DU SGO DANG THABS SNA TSOGS KYI TSUL GYI BSGOM PAR BYA'O,
Here next is the advice. There is no kind of deed as evil as the act of anger for the
way in which it acts as an obstacle to prevent the growth of the spiritual path
within us, and destroys our good karma. Nor is there any spiritual hardship like
patience for breaking the relentless heat of the mental afflictions. You should
practice it then, concentrate on the practice of patience, and use the method of
finding many different ways, an entire variety of techniques, to do so.

Contemplation Two
Anger begins with being upset, and it is useless ever to be upset

,YID MI BDE BA'I ZAS RNYED NAS,
,ZHE SDANG BRTAS TE BDAG 'JOMS SO,
Anger feeds on the food
Of feeling upset, then strengthened
Turns to smash me.

,DE LTAS BDAG GIS DGRA BO DE'I,
,ZAS NI RNAM PAR GZHOM PAR BYA,
And so then I will smash
The sustenance that feeds
This enemy of mine.

,'DI LTAR BDAG LA GNOD PA LAS,
,DGRA 'DI LA NI LAS GZHAN MED,
My foe knows no other
Kind of work at all
Except to cause me pain.

,CI LA BAB KYANG BDAG GIS NI,
,DGA' BA'I YID NI DKRUGS MI BYA,
,MI DGA' BYAS KYANG 'DOD MI 'GRUB,
,DGE BA DAG NI NYAMS PAR 'GYUR,
No matter what happens
I will never allow
My joy to be disturbed.
Feeling upset cannot accomplish
My hopes, and only makes me lose
The goodness that I have.

,GAL TE BCOS SU YOD NA NI,
,DE LA MI DGAR CI ZHIG YOD,
If there is something
You can do about it,
Why should you feel upset?

,GAL TE BCOS SU MED NA NI,
,DE LA MI DGA' BYAS CI PHAN,
If there is nothing
You can do about it,
What use is being upset?

,DANG PO NI, KHONG KHROS SDUG BSNGAL BSKYED PA'I TSUL JI LTA BU ZHE NA, RANG DANG RANG GI BA LA MI 'DOD PA BYAS PA DANG 'DOD PA 'GRUB PA'I GEGS BYAS PA LAS BYUNG BAR GYUR PA'I YID MI BDE NI ZHE SDANG 'PHEL BA'I ZAS YIN PAS YID MI BDE BA'I ZAS RNYED NAS, ZHE SDANG GI LUS BRTAS TE STOBS RGYAS NAS 'DI DANG GZHAN DU BDAG 'JOMS SO,
Here is the first point, on the nature of the causes of anger, and the problems
they bring. "Just how is it," one may ask, "that anger leads me to suffering?"
Consider the emotion of becoming upset, when something you don't want to
happen does happen, either to you, or to someone or something you consider
yours. Consider this same emotion when something happens to prevent you
from getting what you do want. This feeling upset is a kind of food that anger
feeds upon. When anger finds this food, its body is strengthened--fortified--and
then it turns to smash me, in both this and my future lives.

,GNYIS PA NI DE LTA BAS NA BDAG GI DGRA BO ZHE SDANG DE'I ZAS YID MI BDE BA NI RNAM PAR GZHOM PAR BYA STE, 'DI LTAR BDAG LA GNOD PA BYED PA LAS BDAG GI DGRA ZHE SDANG 'DI LA NI LAS GZHAN MED PAS DGRA'I GTZO BO 'DI GZHOM PA LA 'BAD PAR BYA'O,
Here next is the point about making efforts in the methods of stopping anger.
And so then I will smash the emotion of feeling upset, the sustenance that feeds this
enemy of mine, this anger. I will put all my effort into destroying my anger,
who is worst of foes, for he knows no other kind of work at all except to cause me
pain.

,GSUM PA LA GNYIS, YID MI BDE BSKYED MI RIGS PA DANG , DE'I RGYU MTSAN NO, , DANG PO NI, 'O NA YID MI BDE JI LTAR SPANG ZHE NA, SDUG BSNGAL DANG DU BLANGS PA'I PHAN YON BSAMS NAS CI LA BAB KYANG BDAG GIS NI RANG GI DGA' BA'I YID NI DKRUG PAR MI BYA SNYAM DU LEGS PAR BSAMS TE, YID DGA' BA NI YID MI BDE BA'I GNYEN PO YIN PAS MI 'DOD PA CI BYUNG YANG DE LA MI DGE BA BA BYAS KYANG 'DOD PA'I DON MI 'GRUB CING 'DOD PA'I 'BRAS BU 'BYIN PA'I DGE BA DAG NI NYAMS PAR 'GYUR BAS SDUG BSNGAL MTHA' DAG BSKYED PAR 'GYUR RO,
The third point, on the actual methods for stopping anger, has two parts: a
description of how very wrong it is to become upset, and then the reasons why
it is so wrong. Here is the first.
"How can I get rid of the emotion of being upset?" you may ask. You should
first contemplate the benefits of learning to accept suffering gladly. Then you
must learn to think to yourself, clearly, "No matter what happens, I will never
allow my joy to be disturbed." Joy is the antidote for feeling upset; and no matter
what happens that you don't like, doing something which is non-virtuous in
return cannot accomplish your hopes, and only makes you lose the goodness that you
do have, the goodness that can in fact produce the result you are hoping for.
If this happens, then every other sort of suffering will come as well.

,GNYIS PA NI, GANG LA YID MI BDE SKYE BA'I YUL DE LA GAL TE BCOS SU YOD NA NI DE LA MI DGA' BAR BYA BA'I RGYU CI ZHIG YOD, DE MA THAG BCOS PAS YID MI BDE BA MED PAR 'GYUR BA'I PHYIR RO, , GAL TE BCOS SU MED NA YANG DE LA MI DGA' BA BYAS PAS CI PHAN TE NAM MKHA' THOGS BCAS KYIS STONG PA LA MI DGA' BA BYAS KYANG MI PHAN PA BZHIN NO,
Let us consider any of the objects over which we feel upset. If there is
something you can do about it, then why should you ever feel upset at all? You
could take the necessary action to fix it immediately, and never need to feel
upset. If on the other hand there is nothing you can do about it, then what is the
use of being upset? It would be as useless as getting upset at empty space, at
a place where nothing was.

Contemplation Three
Perfect patience is like any other habit, and can be developed with practice

,GOMS NI SLA BAR MI 'GYUR BA'I,
,DNGOS DE GANG YANG YOD MA YIN,
,DE BAS GNOD PA CHUNG GOMS PAS,
,GNOD PA CHEN PO BZOD PAR BYOS,
There is nothing in the world
Which does not come easily
If you make a habit of it;
Make then a habit
Of bearing the small pains,
And thus endure the greater.

,DANG PO NI, BZOD PA GOMS NA SDUG BSNGAL YANG BZOD PAR 'GYUR TE SEMS KYI 'DZIN STANGS THAMS CAD GOMS PA'I RTZA BA CAN YIN PAS GOMS NA SLA BAR MI 'GYUR BA'I SEMS KYI CHOS KYI DNGOS PO DE GANG YANG YOD PA MA YIN NO,
Here is the first point, which is establishing that patience is easy to rely upon
once you have accustomed yourself to it. If you make a habit of patience, then
you will be able to endure any kind of suffering. The way we think of
anything is based primarily on how we have become accustomed to think, on
our mental habits. As such there is nothing in the world--that is, no quality of
the mind--which does not come easily if you make a habit of it.

,RGYU MTSAN DE BAS NA TSA GRANG DANG GZHAN GYIS TSIG RTZUB SMRA BA LA SOGS PA'I GNOD PA CHUNG NGU DANG DU BLANGS NAS BZOD PA BSGOMS PAS DMYAL BA'I ME LA SOGS PA'I GNOD PA CHEN PO'ANG BZOD PAR 'GYUR BAR SEMS PAR BYOS 
For this reason then you should learn to think this way: "Suppose I can bear, and
learn to accept gladly, the small pains--things like feeling too hot or too cold,
or else situations like having someone say something unpleasant to me. If I
make a habit of this, I will thus be able to endure the greater pains as well: things
like the fire of the hell-worlds, and so on.

Contemplation Four
Patience is a decision, a state of mind

SHIG,LA LA BDAG GI KHRAG MTHONG NA,
,DPA' BRTAN LHAG PAR SKYE 'GYUR YOD,
,LA LA GZHAN GYI KHRAG MTHONG NA,
,BOG CING BRGYAL BAR 'GYUR BA YOD,
Some when they catch sight
Of their own blood
Rise to a higher ferocity.
Some when they see
Another person's blood
Faint and fall unconscious.

,DE NI SEMS KYI NGANG BRTAN DANG ,
,SDAR MA'I TSUL LAS GYUR PA YIN,
All of this derives
From either steadfastness
Or cowardice, in the mind.

,DE BAS GNOD PA KHYAD BSAD CING ,
,SDUG BSNGAL RNAMS KYIS MI TSUGS BYOS,
,MKHAS PAS SDUG BSNGAL BYUNG YANG NI,
,SEMS KYI RAB DANG RNYOG MI BYA,
Learn then to disregard
Harms, and never allow
Any pain to touch you.
Hurt may come; but the wise
Never let suffering cloud
Their clarity of mind.

Contemplation Five
Learn to disregard wounds in battle

,NYON MONGS RNAMS DANG G-YUL 'GYED LA,
,G-YUL 'GYED TSE NA GNOD PA MANG ,
,SDUG BSNGAL THAMS CAD KHYAD BSAD NAS,
,ZHE SDANG LA SOGS DGRA 'JOMS PA,
,DE DAG RGYAL BYED DPA' BO STE,
,LHAG MA RO LA GSAD PA'O,
We are locked in combat
With mental affliction, and in war
Many wounds are sustained.
Ignore then any pains
That might come; smash
The foes of anger and such.
Conquering these is the thing
That makes a warrior; the rest
Are killing only corpses.
Contemplation Six
Who really made the things that make us angry?

,GTZO BO ZHES BYAR GANG 'DOD DANG ,
,BDAG CES BRTAGS PA GANG YIN PA,
,DE NYID BDAG NI 'BYUNG BYA ZHES,
,CHED DU BSAMS SHING 'BYUNG BA MED,
This thing they believe
Called the "primal One,"
Or the supposed "Self-Existent Being,"

Never came about by thinking
For a purpose to themselves,
"Now I should occur."

,MA SKYES PAR NI DE MED NA,
,DE TSE SKYE BAR 'DOD PA GANG ,
,YUL LA RTAG TU GA YENG 'GYUR BA,
,'GAG PAR 'GYUR BA'ANG MA YIN NO,
If it cannot be with a thing
That never grew itself, then what
Do you think can grow then?
It must forever shift its focus
To its object, a thing that never
Did come to an end.

,CI STE BDAG DE RTAG NA NI,
,MKHA' BZHIN BYED PA MED PAR MNGON,
,RKYEN RNAMS GZHAN DANG PHRAD NA YANG ,
,'GYUR BA MED LA CI BYAR YOD,
Isn't it obvious, that if this Self
Were unchanging, then like empty space
It could never act to do something?
And even if it happened due to
Other influences, how could they
Act on something changeless?

,BYED PA'I TSE YANG SNGON BZHIN NA,
,BYED PAS DE LA CI ZHIG BYAS,
,DE YI BYED PA 'DI YIN ZHES,
,'BREL PAR 'GYUR BA GANG ZHIG YOD,
When they did then it would stay
Existing as it was before,
So doing would do nothing.
Where is something you can say
It does that has at all any kind
Of relationship with it?

,DE LTAR THAMS CAD GZHAN GYI DBANG ,
,DE YI DBANG GIS DE DBANG MED,
,DE LTAR SHES NA SPRUL LTA BU'I,
,DNGOS PO KUN LA KHRO MI 'GYUR,
And so it is that everything
Depends on other influences,
They on other, inevitably.
Understand this, feel no anger
Towards any of these things
Like pictures of illusion.

RDUL MUN SNYING STOBS GSUM CHA MNYAM PA LA MTSAN NYID LNGA LDAN GYI GTZO BO DANG , DES RNAM 'GYUR GYIS BSDUS PA'I GNOD PA SOGS RANG DBANG DU BSKYED DO ZHES BYA BAR GANG 'DOD PA DANG SHES RIG GI SKYES BU LA BDAG CES BRTAGS NAS YUL LA RANG DBANG DU LONGS SPYOD PAR BRTAGS PA GANG YIN PA DE MI RIGS PAR THAL, BDAG DANG GTZO BO'I DE NYID BDAG NYID RANG DBANG DU YUL MYONG BA DANG RNAM 'GYUR BSKYED PA'I CHED DU 'BYUNG BAR BYA ZHES CHED DU BSAMS SHING 'BYUNG BA MED LA BYA BA BYED MI NUS PA RI BONG GI RVA DANG MTSUNGS PA'I PHYIR RO,
Here is the first point, a refutation of the idea that the primal One could
produce all the expressions of the world on its own accord. Consider now this
thing that they believe in called the "primal One," which is supposed to be made
of equal parts of Particle, Darkness, and Courage, and is supposed to have five
different qualities. They say it does, on its own accord, create harms and other
such things, all included into what are considered its "expressions."
Or consider the supposed "Self-Existent Being," otherwise known as the "Original
Mental Being," which is said to experience its objects on its own accord.

Neither of these though could be real, for the "Self-Existent Being" and the
"primal One" never came about by thinking to themselves, all by themselves, "Now
I should occur, for a specific purpose--so that I can experience objects, or create
my expressions." But in fact they could never make anything occur, they
could never actually do anything, no more than the horns on a rabbit's head
could.

,'BRAS BU BSKYED PA DE'I TSE GTZO BO DE LAS 'BRAS BU SKYE BAR 'DOD PA GANG YIN PA DE MI RIGS PAR THAL, GTZO BO DE NYID MA SKYES PA'I PHYIR, KHYAB PAR THAL, RANG NYID MA SKYES PAR NI 'BRAS BU BSKYED PA DE MED NA STE MED PAS KHYAB PA'I PHYIR RO,
Let's consider what it is that you think can grow then, at the point when the
primal One is supposed to produce some result. It would be completely
mistaken to believe that the One could produce any result, at all, since this One
itself never grew from anything in the first place. And this must absolutely be
the case, because it is logically impossible for anything to produce a result, it
cannot be, if that thing--that is, because that thing--was such that it never grew
itself.

Here is the second point, a refutation of the idea that the Original Mental Being
could experience objects on its own accord. Let us consider this Original
Mental Being. Isn't it true then that it would be a thing that could never have
a time when it was not experiencing its object, that never did come to an
end--that is, never could come to an end with each experience? This is because
(1) you believe it to be an unchanging but functional thing which experiences
its objects; and (2) if it were such a thing, then it must forever shift its focus to
its object. And if this were the case, then it would be impossible for there to
ever be a time when it were not holding to its object.

The second point here is a refutation of the idea that the self-existent being
accepted by the Logicalists could ever exist of its own accord. Here there are
three separate steps: a demonstration that it is incorrect to think that an
unchanging thing could ever produce a result; a demonstration that it is
incorrect to think that this same thing could rely upon some other influence;
a demonstration that this same thing could never share a relationship with
some influence. Here is the first.

The Logicalists believe in a self-existent being that is both something physical
and also an unchanging thing that can perform a function. They say then that
it creates those things that do us harm. But isn't it obvious, isn't it very clear,
that if this Self were an unchanging thing which could perform a function, then
it would be like empty space, and could never act to do something like producing
an effect?

Here is the second step. One may respond with the following: "Although this
Self is by its nature unchanging, it produces results when it encounters certain
influences." And yet it is impossible for an unchanging thing to encounter an
influence; and even if it did happen due to its encountering some other influences,
such as the will that something happen or the like, then how could these things,
these influences, act on something changeless? It could never have any effect
upon it at all, because this Self is changeless.
This logic is inescapable, because when they--any particular influences--did
affect this Self in any way, then the Self would never budge, it would never

change to have any other nature than it already had: it would stay exactly as it
was before. And if the Self never changed, then doing something to it would do
nothing; there wouldn't be the slightest difference between the way it was and
the way it is.

Here is the third step. Someone may respond again, with the following: "Even
though the Self doesn't affect anything else in a way that alters its basic nature,
it does affect things in a way that is peripheral to itself." This too though is
completely incorrect. Where is something you can point to at all and say that this
is the peripheral effect, this is what the Self does in creating its result, that could
have any kind of relationship with it? No relationship is possible, for there is
neither the relationship of identity, nor the relationship of origination.

Here is the third point from before, which is an explanation of why it is
improper to feel anger once you have understood that all beings are like a
magical show. And so it is that everything in the production of a result depends
on other influences, while these influences depend themselves on other, previous
causes and influences, they on theirs, and so on. In a sense then it is inevitable
whether a particular result will come out or not, it is all up to the causes, and
so these things are like a magical show, like pictures of illusion. You must
understand this fact, that each and everything which does something is empty
of any nature of its own, and yet still functions perfectly well. If you do so,
then you will feel no anger towards any of these things that are like pictures of

illusion. Thus you must train yourself in the realization of the fact that
dependent origination has no nature of its own, for it is this realization which
destroys the very seeds of mental affliction.

"But it is right for me to be angry," one may insist, "because the other person
has hurt me." Now if you are going to be angry at what hurt you directly,
then you should feel anger for the stick or the weapon or whatever it was that
delivered the injury directly, since they are what caused the pain. Or suppose
you say that you're not going to get angry at the stick or whatever, since it
didn't act on its own accord, but rather at what made it move: at the person
who impelled the stick. This other person though is not acting on his own accord
either; rather, he himself is set into motion by the force of anger. So if you really
must be angry--if you have no choice, if you cannot help yourself--then you
should get mad at anger itself.

Here is the first point, which covers the reasons why it is wrong to feel anger
at those who are doing harm to holy images and the like. Someone may make
the following argument: "I can admit that it is wrong to feel anger for someone
who has hurt me personally. But there is nothing wrong with getting angry
at those who have harmed the Three Jewels." Suppose though that someone
expresses themselves, speaking against sacred images of the Buddhas, the shrines
of great bodhisattvas and the like, or else the holy Dharma. Or suppose that they
even act bodily to try to destroy these things. It's completely wrong for me to feel
anger even at these kinds of people, since the Buddhas and such, the Three Jewels,
cannot be hurt. In fact, the one who attempts to harm them is someone who
deserves our pity, and so it is more appropriate to feel love for them. The point
here is that the Three Jewels are incapable of sustaining any kind of injury
brought about by mental discomfort due to feeling upset.

Here is the second point, which is why it is appropriate to practice, in the same
way, patience for those who do harm to those who are close to us. Even too
when you see someone hurting another, when persons do harm to the Lamas that
are teaching you the Dharma; or else to the relatives or the like with whom you

share a family relationship [reading rus for dus in the commentary]; and to those
who are your friends, it is wrong to feel anger. This is because of the fact that,
in the way that was explained before, what is happening to them has all come
about through certain causes: that is, through their own past karma--the injuries
are dictated by the karma come from the wrongs that these relatives and so on
committed themselves before. And you should turn back your own anger by
seeing this fact.

Here is the first point, which covers how scripture itself states that living
beings and Buddhas are equivalent as objects towards which to perform merit.
It is absolutely necessary that we honor living beings; and this is why the sutra
entitled The Excellent Collection of Dharma Teachings states that--
The field of living beings is the field of the Buddhas; and it is
from this field of the Buddhas that all the high qualities of the
Buddhas are attained. To attempt the opposite is completely
wrong.
The Able One is here describing how the field of living beings is a place to plant
vast seeds of merit: he is calling this the "field of the Victorious Buddhas," in the
sense that sentient beings are similar to the Teacher himself in how they
provide a field for collecting great merit.

This brings us to the second part, where we establish this point with logic as
well. Here there are two steps: how, by having faith in both the Buddhas and
all living beings, we can reach our ultimate dreams; and why it is wrong to

discriminate between them, since they are equivalent from the point of view
that, by having faith in both, we can reach enlightenment. Here is the first.

It is right to pay honor to every living being, because many persons who felt
faith towards them--towards both Buddhas and living beings--and who
succeeded in pleasing both were able in this way to reach the perfection of the
ultimate: that is, the culmination of both their own needs and those of others.

Here is the second step. For the reasons just stated, the qualities of an
Enlightened One--that is, the powers of a Buddha and so on, the final result
of our practice--are attained by means of both fields: that of living beings and
of the Victorious Buddhas, alike. Why then do you act this way, in this manner,
saying "I refuse to honor other beings in the way that I do the Victors." It is
completely wrong.

Once you have practiced patience as described above--that is, once you have
learned to maintain your patience with various spiritual hardships, and with
the harms that others do to you--then you must, if you hope to achieve
enlightenment quickly, begin your practice of effort. This is because enlightenment
lies in making these kinds of effort in the different perfections. Butter lamps and
other such flames never flicker without a breeze, and just so--in the absence of
effort--it can never occur that one manages to complete the collections of merit
and wisdom. As such, the matchless state of enlightenment itself is something
that all depends upon effort, and so we must make great efforts in practicing
it. Entering the Middle Way makes this same point when it states,
All good qualities are things that follow
In the wake of the perfection of effort.
It is the one cause that brings about both
The collections of merit and knowledge.
Contemplation Two
Effort is joy

,BRTZON GANG DGE LA SPRO BA'O,
What is effort? It is joy
In doing good.

"If laziness is defined as joy in mental affliction, then what is effort?" one may
ask. Effort is a feeling of joy focused upon doing something good.
Effort can be divided into four different types: effort which is like armor;
applied effort; effort where you never feel discouraged or upset; and effort
where you are never satisfied.

Contemplation Three
What stops effort?

,DE YI MI MTHUN PHYOGS BSHAD BYA,
,LE LO NGAN LA ZHEN PA DANG ,

Here I will explain the things
That work against it: these are
Laziness, an attraction to what is bad,
And the feeling of being discouraged--
Belittling yourself.

Here next I will explain the things that work against "it"--meaning effort. What
exactly are they? First there is laziness, which is feeling attracted to the pleasant
feeling of sloth, a condition where the mind and body become unfit to function
well. Next there is an attraction to actions which are bad, and then finally the
feeling of being discouraged when you try to accomplish some virtuous
act--where you belittle yourself by saying, "This is something I could never
accomplish."

What promotes the feeling of laziness
Is sloth--the sweet enjoyment of
Some pleasure--as well as a craving
For time spent sleeping, all leading to
A failure to feel a sense of disgust
For the pain of the circle of life.

Those in the world with you--whether old, young, inbetween, or anything
else--have gone steadily to the slaughter, killed by the Lord of Death. Haven't you
even got eyes to see what's going on? If you do see it, then just sitting here still
and enjoying your sleep is something very wrong. You are for example just the
same as the oxen waiting for the butcher; that is, you are like an ox who can see
that the other oxen are being steadily slaughtered by a butcher, and yet still
feels no fear, and simply relaxes where he is.

Now suppose you say, "But I feel a fear

The third part concerns why it is right to bear gladly with any pain required,
given the fact that the King of Physicians cures the great illness with a
technique which is very gentle. Here there are three different topics: how the
Teacher shows us a method to cure the great illness which does not require us
to experience the slightest bit of pain during the treatment; how the Teacher
has prohibited us from giving away our body so long as we perceive it as
something difficult to do; and how it will come to be nothing difficult to give
away our own body, since the Teacher has instructed us to do so only when
we have become so accustomed to giving away things that we view it as
something similar to giving away vegetables.

DPAG MED GSO BAR MDZAD PAS DKA' SPYAD LA 'JIGS PAR GA LA RIGS,
Here is the first. Consider the hardships that one must undertake to achieve
enlightenment. The Supreme Physician, the Lord of the Able Ones, does not
perform these treatments of his in a way that's like those other, ordinary ones that
are used to cure some illness. Rather he uses a particular kind of technique or
method that's gentle in the extreme, a blissful path to reach a blissful goal. It is
a path which avoids both extremes: it neither leaves one spent and exhausted,
nor leads to the thoughtless consumption of resources. He uses it to cure the
massive and infinite ills of the mental afflictions, which force us to continue
wandering in the circle of suffering. It could never be right then for you to
fear these spiritual hardships.

Here is the second. At the beginning--meaning until such time as we become
more familiar with the perfection of giving--the Guide directs us to begin our
acts of charity with deeds such as giving away pressed scraps of dough, or
vegetables, and anything of the like. Once we have grown accustomed to these and
thus overcome our tendency to think of such acts as something difficult, then
gradually, in good time, we find that we can offer even our flesh. This is another
reason.

,GSUM PA NI, DE LTAR GOMS PAS GANG GI TSE RANG GI LUS LA NI TSOD MA GTONG BA SOGS LTA BU'I BLO SKYES NAS DE'I TSE SHA LA SOGS PA GTONG BAS, DE LA DKA' BA CI ZHIG YOD CUNG ZAD KYANG MED PAS DKA' SPYAD LA 'JIGS PAR MI RIGS SO,
Here is the third. There comes a point when, because we have accustomed
ourselves to these acts as just described, we reach a state of mind where we can
view giving away our bodies just like we view giving away the vegetables and
such. At that stage then why is it we would feel it difficult at all to offer our flesh
or the rest? We wouldn't feel the least difficulty at all. And so it is wrong for
you to feel any kind of fear for undertaking the hardships of a bodhisattva.

Course XVIII: The Great Ideas of Buddhism, Part Three
Reading Two: The Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life,
Fourth of Six Parts
The following contemplations are based on the Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way
of Life (Bodhisattvacharyavatara; Byang-chub-sems-dpa'i spyod-pa la 'jug-pa) of the
Buddhist master Shantideva (circa 700 AD), and the commentary upon it by
Gyaltsab Je Darma Rinchen (1364-1432) entitled Entry Point for Children of the
Victorious Buddhas (rGyal-sras 'jug-ngogs). The relevant sections are found at
folios 21A-23A and 81A-87B, respectively, in the ACIP electronic editions
TD3871 and S5436.
The content of the contemplations is translated directly from the root text and
commentary; the names of the contemplations are not a part of the original
text, but are based on the divisions of Gyaltsab Je's commentary and have been
supplied for reference.

Since they have stopped bad deeds,
They feel no pain; and because
They are wise, there's no dislike.
This is due to the fact that thinking of things
The wrong way, and doing negative deeds,
Harm the body and mind.

Bodhisattvas who have reached the point where their thoughts of compassion
are completely pure feel no pain in their bodies when they give them away.
This is the case since they have stopped each and every kind of bad deed. Neither
when they give their bodies away is there any kind of dislike for the act, because
they are wise in knowing when it is right for them to do so.
This is due to the fact--this is caused by the reason--that thinking of things the
wrong way (believing that a person or the things which belong to a person
could ever have any self-nature), along with doing negative deeds such as taking
life and the rest, harm the body and mind; and great bodhisattvas have managed
to stop these sources of harm.
Contemplation Fourteen

And engaging in the contemplation
Of the benefits that it gives.

,MOS DANG NGA RGYAL DGA' DANG DOR,

Eliminate then what acts against us;
Work hard to use the various forces
Of will, confidence, joy, and also
Leaving off, and being engaged, and the
Feeling of self-command, in order
To increase your capacity for effort.

There are certain armies that we must assemble and use to smash the things
that work against our practice of effort for achieving the goals of living kind. A
king uses his four armed forces to destroy those who oppose him; just so, we
must make use of four forces that provide support for our practice of effort.
The first of these is the force of will, where first we contemplate the laws of
actions and their consequences, which helps us then to develop a strong
aspiration to give up the things that we should give up, and take up those
which we should take up.

MA BRTAGS PAR CI RUNG RUNG DU MI 'JUG LA BRTAGS NAS ZHUGS PA MTHAR 'BYIN PA BRTAN PA'I STOBS DANG ,
Next is the force of steadfastness. Here we learn not to engage unexamined in
just any activity that presents itself, but rather to analyze the activity first, then
engage in it, and finally to bring it to a successful conclusion.

Third is the force of joy, where we put forth a kind of effort which never takes
a break, and is never satisfied; where we act like a child playing a game.
Finally there is the force of leaving off, where we apply effort until our body or
mind becomes tired; then we rest and refresh ourselves, and rise to make
efforts again as soon as we have recovered.

,MOS PA'I STOBS LA MTSON TE BSHAD NA MOS PA'I STOBS NI 'KHOR BA'I SDUG BSNGAL GYIS 'JIGS PA DANG , MOS PA DE'I PHAN YON BSAM PAS BSKYED PAR BYA'O,
We will explain these forces in more detail by taking the force of will as a
model. It should be developed by learning to fear the pain of the circle of
suffering, and by engaging in the contemplation of the benefits that this same will
gives to us.

We must eliminate then what acts against us: one tendency of not engaging in
some good activity even when we see that we are capable of accomplishing it,
and another tendency of feeling incapable, of thinking to ourselves, "How
could I ever do that?" We must work hard to cultivate the qualities that support
effort--to use the four, the various forces of will, confidence (which refers to being
steadfast), joy, and also leaving off.

As we actually perform our good deeds we must be engaged in our effort, in the
sense of utilizing recollection. After this we must try hard to use the force of
a feeling of self-command, control of our body and mind, in order to increase our
capacity for effort to increasingly higher levels.

The sixth chapter of the sutra known as the Victory Banner of Diamond, which
belongs to the "majority" section of scripture, includes the following passage:
We can give, oh son of the gods, the example of the rising sun.
Its shining is in no way stopped by the fact that some people
might be blind, or that a line of mountain tops might be uneven,
or any other such problem. It simply lights up any area which
is ready to receive the light. Just so do bodhisattvas shine, for
the sake of others, and their shining is in no way stopped by the
various problems that individual living beings might have. They
simply act to ripen, and to liberate, any disciple who is ready to
receive their light.
We must utilize the technique described here to practice the kind of confidence that
is required to bring to a successful conclusion any particular virtuous activity,
once one has begun it.

At the very beginning, as you first engage in any particular action, you must
appraise yourself well, to see if you have the mental resources, or ability, that will
be needed. If you find that you do have the ability, then should you decide to
act; but if you find that you do not possess this ability, then you should decide
not to act. The very highest thing to do would be not even to start a thing; but once
you have begun, then you should never allow yourself to stop until you have
brought the activity to a successful conclusion.

Here is the first point, which is identifying the confidence of accomplishment.
Suppose you see someone else undertaking some worthy activity. The
confidence of accomplishment is when you raise the mental power to say to
yourself, "I am willing to do this thing all by myself."

Next is the second point, which is the reason why we should feel this
confidence. You must undertake deeds for the benefit of living beings without
depending on others to help you. This is because the inhabitants of the entire
world live at the mercy of their mental afflictions, and are therefore incapable of

helping even themselves at all. Given this fact, beings can't do what I can do, in
making efforts at good deeds for the sake of others. Even if I did try to rely
on them for help then it would be useless, and thus you must think to yourself,
"I'll be the one to do what must be done for the sake of others."

Think about children playing a game, from which they seek a feeling of fun. These

feel excited about doing--all those kinds of activities where they work for the
sake of others: this work of studying and contemplating, and then meditating
upon the wish for enlightenment. We should try to reach a point where we
become insatiable in seeking this work; and where we want do it continuously,
without a break; in short, we should take great joy in it.

People in the world spend their time with farming and other kinds of work for
the sake of finding some physical and mental happiness. But there is absolutely
no certainty that what they do will ever end up making them happy; there is no
guarantee that by doing these things they will reach any kind of happiness.
There does though exist a single kind of work, the activities of bodhisattvas,
"their own," which invariably makes you happy, in both a temporal and an
ultimate way. How can you ever be happy if you fail to do this particular kind of
work? It will never happen.

Consider the various objects of desire: visual objects, sounds, and so on. They
are just like honey smeared on a razor blade--if you lick the blade you might
experience a hint of good taste, but then you suffer as it slices open your
tongue. No matter how much you have of these sense objects here in the circle
of suffering, you can never feel satisfied.
Now consider the various deeds of merit: giving and the rest. They are
happiness in that they allow you to reach short-term types of karmic fruits or
results--an exceptional type of birth in the higher realms, life as a worldly
pleasure being or human. And ultimately they allow you to achieve as well the
happiness of peace, of having put to rest each and every suffering that there is.
Why is it that, at the same time as you are never satisfied with sense objects, you
are always content with the sum of the merit you have for reaching these other
kinds of happiness?

Here is the third point, which is how recollection and awareness leave no
opening for problems to arise. Imagine now that someone has shot you with
a poison arrow, and that the poison is making its way throughout your entire body,
riding upon the blood as it courses through your veins. Just so do the various
mental afflictions, such as losing your recollection, act should they find any
opening to do so. And when they do find an opening, then the different
negativities of anger and the rest make their way throughout the entire mind. For
this reason you must try to stop even the slightest mental affliction whenever
it should arise.

"How can I learn to concentrate on this?" you may ask. Suppose a person handed
you a bowl completely full of oil, and made you walk down a slippery path.
Suppose then that they stood before you holding a sword, threatening to take your
life should you spill even a single drop. Out of complete fear, you would try your
utmost to concentrate. Those of you who are ascetics in the sense of attempting
to follow the life of a bodhisattva must be like this; you must concentrate by
keeping tight hold on your recollection, aimed at the various antidotes such as
the wish for enlightenment, and the like.
Contemplations on the Perfection of Meditation

Once you've developed your practice of effort
In the way described above, then place
Your mind in single-pointedness.

Now once you've developed your practice of effort--your joy over doing good
things--in the way it was described in the explanation above, then you must learn
to place your mind in single-pointed meditation. A person whose mind is in a state
of constantly wandering, due to mental dullness or restlessness, lives his life in the
jaws of mental affliction, which is so much like a great and dangerous wild beast.
The point is that such a person is very close to being destroyed completely.

"How is it," one may ask, "that I can learn to eliminate this wandering state of
mind?" The answer is that this constant wandering--the enemy of single-pointed
concentration-- never occurs with those who remain in isolation of body and mind;
meaning with those who are able to keep themselves from the hustle and
bustle of life physically, as well as from thoughts of desire and the like.
Contemplation Two
Stopping attachment

Understand first the fact that vision
Married close to quietude
Destroys the mental afflictions.
Begin then by seeking quietude;
It in turn is achieved by the bliss
Of losing attachment for the world.

You should understand first the following fact. Meditative quietude consists of
practicing a state of single-pointedness upon some virtuous object until one has
been able to eliminate mental restlessness and dullness from the mind; this
then brings on a kind of bliss caused by the extreme manageability of the body
and mind. This quietude is like a horse married to its rider, which is the special
vision of realizing emptiness. The combination of the two then is able to destroy
completely every mental affliction of the three realms, along with the seeds for
these afflictions. Since this is the case, you must seek to achieve a special
vision which brings on the state of manageability, which itself occurs through
being able to analyze the true nature of existence. To achieve this vision
though you must first begin by seeking meditative quietude, for it is impossible to
develop special vision without first achieving this quietude.

It--this quietude--is in turn achieved by a feeling of bliss, which is caused by
losing one's attachment to the world, in both the inner and the outer sense; that
is, attachment to the body, to possessions, and so on. The reason for this is
that attachment to these things makes us slaves of mental restlessness and
dullness.

stop any suffering for ourselves. We must learn to act just the same way

One may make the following objection:
I don't see how it could be the right thing to do to act towards
the happiness and the sufferings of others exactly the same as I
do towards those of my own; the reason I say this is that the
number of living beings is absolutely infinite, and there is no way
that I could ever think "me" about every one of them.
Think though about the many separate parts of your body: your feet, your hands,
and all the rest. Even though there are many of these parts, we think of them all
as "mine," and care dearly for all of them, as the single body of a single person.
The various different types of beings--worldly gods, humans, and the like--are
just so. Even though they are separate, there is no distinction between their
individual joys and their individual pains: I can learn to view them as
indistinguishable, and then conceive of all of them as if they were my own self,
just as I conceive of myself as myself. The point here is that I could learn to
think about every one of them in the same way, and say to myself, "I shall work
to achieve this particular happiness," and "I shall work to stop this particular
suffering."

One may make yet another objection:
Two facts here are the same: the pain that others have doesn't
hurt me; and the pain that I have doesn't hurt others. Therefore
you are incorrect when you say that I should make very
intentional efforts to remove their pain in exactly the same way
that I make efforts to remove my own pain.
Yet there is no such problem in our reasoning. Suppose you do object this way,
and say that your pain never hurts the body of another, any more than their pain
hurts you. Even so, their pain is your pain. This is because your own pain is
something you find unbearable for just one reason: your habit of grasping to yourself
as yourself.

Suppose that, just so, you become accustomed to considering others yourself
as well. Even though it may be true then that the sufferings which others feel may
never come and strike you personally, still the suffering that these living beings
feel is your suffering to work to remove, since you'll find it hard to bear it when
sufferings come to them, once you have learned to grasp to them as being
yourself.

Suppose you say the following: "The reason why I don't try to protect all living
beings from their suffering is that when this pain comes to them it doesn't hurt
to me personally." This though is totally wrong. According to this way of
thinking, it must be a mistake for people to try to accumulate money during
their younger years out of a concern that they will undergo some kind of
suffering during their later years; or for any one of us to try to find some way
today, or this morning, to prevent some suffering that we think may come to
us tomorrow, or later in the day. Why then do you try to protect yourself from
some future pain, from some suffering that you are afraid might come later, since
it doesn't do any hurt to you, to the person who exists at the earlier point in
time, either? According to your way of thinking, it must be incorrect to do so.

Someone may give the following reply:
If in this life I fail to stop the causes that are going to bring me
suffering in my later lives, then I myself will have to experience
that suffering in my later life. As such, it is quite appropriate
that I make efforts in the various methods of stopping these
causes.
Here you have an idea that you must do so because you think to yourself that the
you in this life will have to experience the pain in their future lives; but your idea
is all wrong. This is because the person who in this case has already died is one
person, and the one who's taken birth in the future lives is another altogether; it's
completely wrong to say that these two are one and the same.

By the way, the logic presented here is meant to refute the idea that, because
two people are separate entities, it is wrong to say that either one of them is
obliged to work to remove the suffering of the other. To accomplish this
refutation, we present a parallel example involving the two separate versions
of one person at successive points in time. It is not though the intent of the
root text here to deny the fact that, in an ultimate sense, the successive versions
of a person do constitute a single person.

And suppose further that the pain of any particular part of the body were only
something which that one particular part had to care about and try to remove. If
this were the case, then a pain caused in the foot when a thorn pierced it would be

nothing for the hand to worry about; why then would the hand care about the
suffering that the foot was undergoing? According to you it would be wrong
to do so.

Suppose you say now the following:
Although it is wrong to assert that two objects which are unrelated
should work to remove each other's suffering, here it's different.
In this case we assume that I have become accustomed to holding
to a particular self: I consider the bodies of the previous and
succeeding lives, and the bodies of the earlier part of the day and
the latter part of the day, and so on, to be one person. And it is
due to the fact that I have become accustomed to thinking this way
that one of these engages in attempting to remove the pain of the
other.
It is very wrong though to hold to the existence of this "self" and "other" which
are able to perform some action on their own. They are nothing but something
you should reject, with all the strength you have. This is because the tendency to
hold onto some self-nature of the person is mistaken in what it believes to
exist, and is responsible for causing every kind of devastation.

Here is the third point, which is disproving the objection of thinking that it is
wrong to engage in the practice of treating myself and others the same.
Someone may make the following objection:
The two cases are not the same; [in the former case, of myself
and others,] the two beings involved are separate and have no
connection. The feet and hands of any one person though are
one collection of parts, and the person in his younger and older
years, or else in his previous and succeeding lives, is one
continuum. Therefore in this latter case it is logical that one of
the members should undertake to remove the suffering of the
other, whereas in the former case it is not logical.
Isn't it true though that there is no collection, and no continuum either, which
can act on its own accord? Because isn't it the case that the things we call a
"continuum" and a "collection" are simply unreal, in being concepts applied to
multiple parts--just like the concepts of a string of things [such as a rosary of
beads, or a garland of flowers], or an army, or anything similar? Isn't a
continuum simply a concept applied to the combination of what came before
and what came later, and isn't a collection simply a concept applied to the
components that make it up? Aren't they both therefore unreal?

One may make an additional objection:
All those things which can be considered one of the things that
any one person possesses are things which that person controls,
and therefore the suffering of any one member is something that
another member must try to remove, even though these members
may be separate in either location or time.
That so-called "self" of any one person who has suffering though is something
which doesn't exist at all. So who is he then, this person who supposedly acts
on his own accord, that could ever control "it," meaning their own happiness
and pain? And how could these ever be anything that he controlled? The two
are completely equal in being neither.

Since this is true--that is, for the reason that the one who supposedly owns a pain
does not exist anyway--there can be no distinctions at all among then any of the
sufferings which myself and others experience. In a nominal sense though, in
a relative sense, we can speak of the sufferings of "myself" and "others," and
so we can say that it is "right to make efforts to remove the sufferings of
others, just as we strive to remove our own sufferings."

Here is the second more general point: a brief summary. Therefore, the pain
that someone else is feeling is something that I must rightly work to remove, for
the simple reason that it is a kind of pain. What use is it so say here that the
distinction between myself and others is something that is fixed? We must
undertake to eliminate each and every pain of every other person; you can't
therefore continue this argument of yours, where you keep asking why the pains
of all other beings are something you must stop, even though they don't do any
hurt to you. Your own pain is not something that you ever wanted; so if you're
going to stop it, then it is right that you must stop all of the pain that exists. But
if the pain of others is not something that you should remove, then your own
pain should be just like that of all other beings: meaning that your own pain then
would never be something that you should work to remove either. Given all
this, you must learn to cherish others just as you cherish yourself, and make
dedicated efforts to remove their suffering.

One may continue with the following objection:
I could never come to think of another's body as "me," or of the
eye that belonged to another as being "my eye." How then could
I ever reach the state of mind where I learn to act towards other
people's happiness and suffering in exactly the same way that I
do towards my own?
If in saying this you assume that you have not yet accustomed yourself to the
idea, then we can agree that you never could reach this state of mind. By
accustoming yourself to the idea though, you have learned to think of, to grasp to,

a few drops of semen and blood that belong to other people--to your father and
mother--as being "me," yourself, even though there's no such thing as your "self"
at all. This is all done through the power of getting used to something. Why
then do you say that you cannot think of the bodies of other people as being yourself
as well? You should learn to think this way; if you get used to the idea, then
you will be able to reach that state of mind where you think of their bodies as
your own. Thus it is that we should contemplate carefully upon the great
benefits that come from cherishing other people, and strive as best we can to
remove their sufferings.

it, for it's just like the way that we have already gotten accustomed to
cherishing ourselves.

One may make yet another objection: "Living beings are infinite; I could never
manage to think of them all as being myself." Your own hands and such are
separate things; yet when you think of them you do consider them all something
you must care for, since they are all a part of your body. The different kinds of
living beings, even though they are many, are still something that you can get
used to cherishing; and if you do so, then you will come to cherish them as
you do your own body. So why then don't you consider every creature that has a

When the bodhisattva named "John" engages in the practice of exchanging
himself and others, he should think to himself, "This one, John, should receive
the honor of others." Then he should think of other living beings as himself and
say, "But since we are inferior in the good qualities that we possess, it should
not be us who gets the honor." We should furthermore never get the things that
make us happy in that way that he, this John, always does. He, the bodhisattva
John, should bask in praise, and we, all of us sentient beings, should be belittled.

He should have all happiness, and we should have the suffering. We should be
the ones who have to do all of the work--such as carrying heavy loads and the
like--and he, John, should sit around in perfect leisure. Throughout the world he,
this bodhisattva, should become known as a man who is great in his morality, his
learning, and all the rest, whereas we should stay inferior, and known as knowing
nothing.

The fact that he is so superior, and we so inferior, is all established by
comparison. Remember then that there do exist those people of exceeding good
qualities compared to whom this bodhisattva is himself inferior. There are also
those miserable beings compared to whom we are the highest. Therefore there is
no need for us, for us living beings, to feel discouraged; with effort, we can
achieve enlightenment. Do the practice this way, thinking of others as being
yourself.

Suppose someone comes and says, "You are inferior to this bodhisattva John,
due to the fact that your morality and your worldviews are degenerate, and
the like." But the degenerate state of our morality and worldviews, and the fact
that we have troubles making a living and all the rest--all this degeneration of
both the way we think and the way we act--is forced upon us by temporary
factors, by mental affliction. The problem here is not that we have chosen to be
this way, not that we want to be this way. The relevant part of the root text
here can also be read as "are rather forced by the temporary factor of
affliction."

The following contemplations are based on the Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way
of Life (Bodhisattvacharyavatara; Byang-chub-sems-dpa'i spyod-pa la 'jug-pa) of the
Buddhist master Shantideva (circa 700 AD), and the commentary upon it by
Gyaltsab Je Darma Rinchen (1364-1432) entitled Entry Point for Children of the
Victorious Buddhas (rGyal-sras 'jug-ngogs). The relevant sections are found at
folios 30B-31A and 114A-117A, respectively, in the ACIP electronic editions
TD3871 and S5436.
The content of the contemplations is translated directly from the root text and
commentary; the names of the contemplations are not a part of the original
text, but are based on the divisions of Gyaltsab Je's commentary and have been

Contemplations on the Perfection of Wisdom
Contemplation One
We need to see emptiness

,, BZHI PA LHAG MTHONG GI NGO BO SHES RAB LA BSLAB TSUL LA GNYIS, LE'U'I GZHUNG BSHAD PA DANG , LE'U'I MTSAN NO,
The fourth principal section, how to train oneself in wisdom, the essence of
special insight, has two parts of its own: an explanation of the body of the
[ninth] chapter, and an explanation of the chapter's name.

,DANG PO LA GSUM, THAR PA THOB PAR 'DOD PAS DE KHO NA NYID RTOGS PA'I SHES RAB BSKYED DGOS PAR BSTAN PA DANG , DE KHO NA NYID RTOGS PA'I SHES RAB JI LTAR BSKYED PA'I THABS DANG , DES NA DE BSKYED PA LA 'BAD PAR GDAMS PA'O,
The first part has three sections of its own: a demonstration that those who
wish to reach freedom must develop the wisdom which realizes thusness; the
way to develop wisdom which realizes thusness; and advice that one should,
therefore, make great efforts to develop this wisdom.

,DANG PO LA GNYIS, SPYI'I DON DANG , YAN LAG GI DON TO,
The first of these sections comes in two steps: the general point, and secondary
points.

,DANG PO NI, GZHAN RGYUD KYI SDUG BSNGAL MTHA' DAG ZHI BAR BYED LA BLA NA MED PA'I BYANG CHUB THOB DGOS PAS, DE KHO NA NYID RTOGS DGOS KYANG RANG RGYUD KYI SDUG BSNGAL ZHI BA LA DE KHO NA NYID RTOGS CI DGOS SNYAM NA, MGON PO KLU SGRUB KYIS JI SRID PHUNG POR 'DZIN YOD PA, DE SRID DE LA NGAR 'DZIN YOD, , CES PHUNG PO BDEN 'DZIN YOD PA DE SRID DU NGA DANG NGA YI BAR RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYIS GRUB PAR 'DZIN PA'I 'JIG LTA MI LDOG PAR GSUNGS LA, NYAN RANG DGRA BCOM PAS 'JIG LTA ZAD PAR MA SPANGS PA SU YANG MI 'DOD CING , DE LA PHUNG PO BDEN 'DZIN ZAD DGOS PAS NYAN RANG 'PHAGS PAS KYANG PHUNG PO BDEN MED DU RTOGS PAR BZHED PA LTAR, SLOB DPON 'DIS KYANG 'KHOR BA'I SDUG BSNGAL ZHI BA LA YANG DE KHO NA NYID RTOGS DGOS PAR BZHED DO, 'OG TU YANG 'CHAD PAR 'GYUR RO,
Here is the first section. One might have the following thought:
It's true that, in order to help put an end to the entire amount of
suffering that exists in other people, we must achieve matchless
enlightenment. And for this reason we must realize thusness.
How could it be though that, in order to put an end only to that
suffering which exists in ourselves, we would also have to realize
thusness?

Remember though that our Protector, Nagarjuna, has said the following:
As long as a person possesses the habit
Of grasping to the heaps as true,
For just this long will they also grasp
To the thought that these are "me."
He is saying here that, as long as we still possess the habit of grasping to our
heaps as true, then for just this long will we find ourselves unable to reverse
our "view of destruction": our tendency to view these heaps as being "me" or
"mine," in a way where they exist through some nature of their own. To do
this though, one must finish off one's tendency to grasp to the heaps as
existing in truth.
Now there is no one at all who would claim that enemy destroyers of the
Listener or Self-Made Buddha types have not yet eliminated their "view of
destruction" in its entirety. As such, the Protector is here stating the position
that realized beings of these two types as well have realized that the heaps
have no true existence. And in keeping with this position, the present master
[Shantideva] also holds the position that--even just to put an end to the
sufferings of the cycle of life--one must still realize thusness. This point will
also be discussed further on.
Contemplation Two
What goes first for wisdom

,YAN LAG 'DI DAG THAMS CAD NI,
,THUB PAS SHES RAB DON DU GSUNGS,
All of these branches then were stated
By the Able Ones to be
Something for the purpose of wisdom.

,YAN LAG 'DI DAG CES PA LE'U BRGYAD PA NAS BSHAD PA'I ZHI GNAS TZAM LA 'CHAD PA DANG , SBYIN SOGS PHAR PHYIN LHAG MA THAMS CAD LA 'CHAD PA'I LUGS GNYIS LAS, LE'U SNGA PHYI GNYIS TZAM GYI 'BREL BA LA SBYAR NA SNGA MA YANG RUNG MOD KYANG 'DIR PHYI MA LTAR BSHAD NA LEGS SO,
There are two different ways of explaining the phrase "these branches" in the
root text at this point. Sometimes it is explained as referring only to the
practice of quietude which was covered in the eighth chapter. But it is also
explained as referring to all of the remaining perfections, of giving and the rest.
If we restrict ourselves only to the relation between the present and the
preceding chapters, then the former method of explaining the phrase is also
admittedly appropriate. Here though it would be better if we commented
upon the phrase in its latter sense.

,SBYIN PA LA SOGS PA'I YAN LAG SHES RAB KYI DON DU GSUNGS, , ZHES PA LA DOGS PA 'DI LTAR BCAD DE, DE KHO NA NYID THOS BSAM GYIS RTOGS PA LA SBYIN SOGS SNGON DU 'GRO DGOS PA MA YIN TE, SPYIR STONG NYID RTOGS PA LA TSOGS BSAG DGOS KYANG 'DIR BSHAD PA 'DRA BA'I BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA'I SPYOD PA SNGON DU 'GRO MI DGOS TE SLOB DPON ZHI 'TSOS STONG NYID THOS BSAM GYIS GTAN LA 'BEBS TSUL GNYIS BSHAD PA BZHIN NO,
The full phrase here in the root text says that the branches of giving and the
rest were stated to be for the purpose of wisdom. There are a number of
questions raised by this statement which bear examination.
It is not the case that, to realize thusness through the processes of learning and
contemplation, giving and the rest must come before. Although it is true that
one must accumulate great merit in order to realize emptiness, it is not
necessary that the kinds of bodhisattva activities described here come first. We
could for example mention the two methods of coming to an understanding
of emptiness, through learning and contemplation, as described by Master
Shantarakshita.

,STONG NYID LA YID 'GYUR BA'I MYONG BA SKYE BA LA YANG DE DAG SNGON DU 'GRO DGOS PA'ANG MIN TE, DE LTA NA MI RTAG PA RTOGS PA LTA BU'I NYAMS MYONG LA'ANG DE DAG SNGON DU 'GRO DGOS PA MTSUNGS SO,
Neither is it the case that, in order to have an experience of emptiness that
would lead to a deep conviction in it, these other perfections would have to
come first. If this were so, then they would also have to come first in order for
a person to have a deep experience of something like the realization of
impermanence--the two causes would be just the same.

,STONG NYID RTOGS PA'I SGOM BYUNG GI LHAG MTHONG SKYE BA LA DE DAG SNGON DU 'GRO DGOS PA'ANG MIN TE, BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA'I SPYOD PA DE DAG SNGON DU MA SONG YANG NYAN RANG GIS DE KHO NA NYID RTOGS PA'I TSUL SNGAR BSHAD PA BZHIN NO,
It is not even the case that these have to come before one is able to develop the
kind of special insight which realizes emptiness and which comes through the
process of meditation. This is true because, as we have just mentioned,
persons of the Listener and Self-Made Buddha types are able to realize
thusness without the activities of a bodhisattva having come before.

,STONG NYID RTOGS PA'I SHES RAB KYIS CHOS SKU'I NYER LEN BYED CING SBYIN SOGS THABS RNAMS KYIS DE'I LHAN CIG BYED RKYEN BYED PAS SHES RAB KYIS 'BRAS BU DE THOB PA LA SBYIN SOGS RNAMS KYIS PHAN DGOS PAS DE DAG SHES RAB KYI DON DU GSUNGS SO ZHE NA, DE LTA NA SHES RAB DE DAG GI DON DU GSUNGS ZHES GO LDOG NA YANG MTSUNGS SO,
One may assert the following:
The wisdom wherein one realizes emptiness provides the
material cause for the dharma body, and the perfections which
relate to "method"--that is, giving and the like--provide the
contributing factors for this body. Therefore giving and the
others must make their contribution in order for wisdom to help
us to attain this goal. And this is why the text says that "they
were stated to be for the purpose of wisdom."
If this were true though, we could just as well reverse the statement, and say
that "wisdom was stated to be for the purpose of them."

,DES NA STONG NYID RTOGS PA'I SHES RAB MED NA SGRIB GNYIS GANG GI YANG SA BON ZAD PAR BYED MI NUS LA NYON SGRIB KYI SA BON ZAD PA TZAM LA TSOGS MTHA' YAS PAS BRGYAN PA MI DGOS KYANG , SHES SGRIB KYI SA BON ZAD PA LA DGOS SHING 'DIR YANG GTZO BO SHES SGRIB ZAD PA'I DON DU YIN PAS YAN LAG 'DI DAG SHES RAB DON DU GSUNGS PA YIN NO,
The real point then is as follows. Without the wisdom which realizes
emptiness, you could never finish off the seeds of any one of the two obstacles;
and it is not necessary that one be enriched with limitless masses of merit in
order to finish off just the seed of those obstacles which relate to the mental
afflictions. In order to finish off the seed of those obstacles which relate to
seeing all existing objects, however, it is necessary to be enriched in this way.
And since our work here is concerned primarily with finishing off the obstacles
to seeing all objects, then we can say that "these branches were stated to be
something for the purpose of wisdom."
Contemplation Three
The Two Realities

,KUN RDZOB DANG NI DON DAM STE,
,'DI NI BDEN PA GNYIS SU 'DOD,
We accept the truths as being two:
The one which is deceptive,
And the one which is the ultimate.

,DANG PO NI, BSLAB BTUS SU YAB SRAS 'JAL BA'I MDO DRANGS PA LAS, 'DI LTAR DE BZHIN GSHEGS PAS KUN RDZOB DANG DON DAM PA GNYIS THUGS SU CHUD DE SHES PAR BYA BA YANG KUN RDZOB DANG DON DAM PA'I BDEN PA 'DIR ZAD DO, , DE YANG BCOM LDAN 'DAS KYIS STONG PA NYID DU RAB TU GZIGS, RAB TU MKHYEN, LEGS PAR MNGON DU BYAS PAS DE'I PHYIR THAMS CAD MKHYEN PA ZHES BYA'O ZHES GSUNGS TE, SHES PAR BYA BA YANG ZHES PAS SHES BYA DBYE GZHI DANG , 'DIR ZAD DO ZHES PAS BDEN GNYIS SU GRANGS NGES PA DANG , BDEN PA GNYIS KA DE BZHIN GSHEGS PAS THUGS SU CHUD PA'I PHYIR THAMS CAD MKHYEN PAR BSTAN TO, , DES NA DON DAM PA'I BDEN PA SHES BYA MA YIN PA DANG BLO GANG GIS KYANG MA RTOGS PA SPYOD 'JUG GI DGONGS PAR 'CHAD PA NI LOG PAR 'CHAD PA'O,
Here is the first of the three. The following quotation from the Sutra on the
Meeting of the Father and the Son appears in the Compendium of the Trainings:

Thus do Those Who Have Gone That Way fathom the deceptive
and the ultimate: and so, knowable objects are either deceptive
truth or ultimate truth, and nothing else. So too do the
Conquerors see them perfectly as emptiness; know them so,
perfectly, and bring them to reality with excellence; and this is
why they we call them the All-Knowing.
The fact that all knowable objects are the thing which is divided into two
truths is conveyed by the words "...and so, knowable objects." The phrase "and
nothing else" expresses the fact that there are exactly two truths, no more and
no less. The point too is that, because Those Who Have Gone That Way
fathom both the truths completely, they are all-knowing. As such, the
explanation that it is the intent of the Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life to
say that ultimate truth is not a knowable object, or that it cannot be realized
by any state of mind at all, is an explanation which is completely wrong.
Contemplation Four
Things are Empty and Things Still Work

,GNYI GA YANG NI 'DOD PA'I DPES,
,'BRAS BU'I DON DU MA DPYAD PHYIR,
Through examples accepted
By no less than both; and because
For the goals they don't examine.

,DANG PO NI, PHAL PA'I GRUB MTHA' LA CHOS THAM CAD RANG BZHIN MED PAR RTOGS PA'I RNAL 'BYOR PA'I RIGS PAS GNOD PA MI 'THAD DE RANG BZHIN MED PA'I SGRUB BYED MED PA'I PHYIR DANG , RANG BZHIN MED NA 'BRAS BU SANGS RGYAS KYI DON DU SBYIN SOGS LA SLOB PA DON MED PAR 'GYUR RO ZHE NA,
Here is the first. One might make the following claim:
It's incorrect to say that the logic used by high practitioners who
have realized that things have no nature of their own disproves
the school of those known as "common persons." This is because
there exists no proof that things have no such nature. And if

nothing has any nature of its own, then it's completely
meaningless for a person to train themselves in giving and the
rest in order to reach the final goal of Buddhahood.

RANG BZHIN MED PA'I SGRUB BYED MED PA MA YIN PAR THAL, DBU MA PA DANG DNGOS SMRA BA GNYIS KA LA YANG NI RDZUN PAR GRAGS SHING 'DOD PA'I RMI LAM DANG SGYU MA LA SOGS PA'I DPES TE DE LA BRTEN NAS RANG BZHIN MED PAR GRUB PA'I PHYIR,
Isn't it though not true that there exists no proof that things have no nature of
their own? Because can't we prove that things have no nature by utilizing the
examples--that is, through the examples--of a dream, an illusion, or anything
of the like; which are accepted, agreed upon by convention, as being false, by
no less than both those of the Middle-Way School and those who assert that
things which function exist truly?

RANG BZHIN MED NA SBYIN SOGS LA SLOB PA DON MED DU 'GYUR BA MA YIN PAR THAL, SANGS RGYAS LA SOGS PA'I 'BRAS BU THOB PA'I DON DU SBYIN SOGS BDEN PAR MA GRUB KYANG MA BRTAGS MA DPYAD PA RDZUN PA SGYU MA LTA BUR RTOGS PA'I SHES RAB KYIS ZIN NAS 'JUG PA'I PHYIR, RANG BZHIN MED RTOGS KYI SHES RAB KYIS MA ZIN NA PHAR PHYIN LHAG MA RNAMS KYIS PHAR PHYIN GYI MING MI THOB CING DE'I DMIGS BU DANG BCAS PA RNAM MKHYEN GYI GRONG KHYER DU BGROD DGOS PA'I PHYIR RO,
And isn't it not the case that, if something has no nature of its own, then
training oneself in giving and the rest is meaningless? Because isn't it rather
true that a person engages in giving and the rest for achieving the goals of
Buddhahood and such, but all along with thoughts imbued by that wisdom
which realizes that these practices are false, like an illusion? One thus engages
in practices which do not exist in truth, but does so without actively
considering or examining their real nature. The fact is that, unless they are
imbued with the wisdom which realizes that things have no nature of their
own, the remaining perfections don't even deserve to be called "perfections."
And it is only when they are guided by the eyes of wisdom that the other five
perfections are able to make the journey to the city of all-knowingness.

Contemplation Five
What it Means When We Say Things Work

,'JIG RTEN PA YIS DNGOS MTHONG ZHING ,
,YANG DAG NYID DU'ANG RTOG BYED KYI,
,SGYU MA LTA BUR MIN PAS 'DIR,
,RNAL 'BYOR PA DANG 'JIG RTEN RTZOD,
Those in the world can see
Things that function;
They also imagine them pure,
But not as being just like
An illusion; thus practitioners
And those in the world do argue.

Someone may assert the following:
You do accept, as well as we do, the fact that we can see with our own eyes
objects such as a fire which has the ability to perform a function such as
cooking food or the like. Since this is what it means for us when we say that
something exists in truth, you and we have nothing to argue about. If on the
other hand you refuse that these objects exist, then you are disproved in a
great many ways--including the way you would then contradict what we can
all see with our own eyes.

'DI DAG NI DNGOS PO RANG BZHIN GYIS MED NA YE MED DU 'GYUR ZHING YOD NA RANG BZHIN GYIS YOD DGOS SNYAM PA BDEN GNYIS 'GAL BAR 'DZIN PA'I RTZOD PA'O, , DBU MA PA DANG DNGOS POR SMRA BA'I 'JIG RTEN PA YIS ME LA SOGS PA'I DNGOS PO GNYIS KAS TSAD MAS MTHONG

Your argument though is one based on the idea that the two truths cannot
coexist: you think that if functional things have no nature of their own, then
they must not exist at all; and that if these things do exist, then they must exist
with some nature of their own. It is true that those in the world who are of the
Middle-Way school and those who are members of the group which asserts
that functional things must exist truly can both see things that function, such as
fire, with valid perception, and both therefore accept the existence of these
objects. Those who believe that functional things exist truly though imagine or
believe that these things exist purely; they cannot grasp the fact that they are
void of any true existence, that they are just like an illusion. Those of the
Middle-Way school though do grasp this fact, and thus there really is an
argument here between the "high practitioners," those of the Middle-Way school,
and those in the world who assert that things which perform a function exist
truly. By the way, you can also interpret the first reference to "those in the
world" here as applying only to those who assert that functional things exist
truly.
Contemplation Six
Empty Virtues Do Work Perfectly

,SGYU 'DRA'I RGYAL LAS BSOD NAMS NI,
,JI LTAR DNGOS YOD LA JI BZHIN,
The merit that comes from victorious
Buddhas is like an illusion;
Just as things that existed.

PA LA BSOD NAMS 'BYUNG BAR 'DOD PA CI LTA BA BZHIN NO, , BDEN RUNG MI BDEN RUNG DNGOS PO DANG MTHUN PAR BSOD NAMS 'BYUNG BA YIN NO,
Here is the second point, [a refutation of the idea that you could never
accumulate the collections needed to produce the body and mind of a Buddha].
One might continue with yet another objection:
Isn't it contradictory to say that things have no nature of their
own, and at the same time to state that a person can gain
meritorious karma from acts such as making offerings to the
victorious Buddhas?
And yet it is no contradiction. It is in fact true that one obtains meritorious
karma from making offerings to victorious Buddhas who are themselves void of
any true existence--who are just like an illusion. Think of the way in which
you believe that meritorious karma comes relative to victorious Buddhas that
you think to exist as things which perform a function and which exist in truth.
This kind of karma actually does come from functional things just as you
thought, in exact accord with what they are, regardless of whether they are
true or not in the sense you take it.
Contemplation Seven
The Difference between Good and Bad is Empty and Perfectly True

Here is the fourth point, [a refutation of the idea that there would be no
distinction between good deeds and bad deeds]. One might return with yet
another objection:
When you say that living beings have no nature of their own,
and that they are like an illusion, don't you contradict the
explanation that a person who kills such a being collects a bad
deed?

Remember though that, even if you attempt to kill or do any such act towards
a being who turns out to be only an illusion created by some magic, you still
strike with your weapon or whatever desiring to kill them, and conceiving of
them as an actual human being. And then you still collect the bad deed of
undertaking to kill someone, even though--since it had no mind--there is no bad
deed in the sense of the actual event. Suppose on the other hand that you act
towards a human or the like, those beings who do possess a mind which is itself
an illusory one. It is then the case that there do occur meritorious deeds when

One may continue with this question:
If they are all exactly the same in having no nature of their own,
then why is it that some of these objects occur with a mind, and
others occur without a mind?
The different things used to create an illusion, whether they be magic powders
or special incantations, have no power to create an illusion which also possesses
a mind. Therefore a mind can never happen with a horse or cow which is a
magical illusion. Even magical illusions though can occur in a great variety of
forms, coming as they do through a great variety of conditions. The word "even,"
by the way, is meant to indicate that this fact is not restricted to actual living
beings. The point is that there is never any case at all where a single condition
can create all the different kinds of results: for a variety of results to occur,
there must occur a variety of causes.

Here is the fifth point, [a refutation of the idea that there would be no fixed
distinction between the cycle of suffering and transcending this cycle]. Those
of the Middle-Way school say that there is no birth or aging or anything of the
like which exists in an ultimate way. They also assert that the fact that all
objects are void of any nature of their own is necessarily a natural state of
nirvana. They assert finally that the cycle of suffering consists of the events of
birth, aging, and the rest, all occurring through the power of karma and mental
afflictions. To these points the Sutrists make the following objection:
Suppose that if something is a kind of nirvana which exists
ultimately, or which comes by nature, then it is necessarily a kind
of nirvana. Suppose further that the fact that the cycle of suffering
is void of any nature of its own is itself this ultimate kind of
nirvana; but that a person circles around in this circle of
suffering, in a stream of births and deaths, all as a kind of
deceptive reality. If this were true then there would have to exist
a thing which was, simultaneously, both the cycle of suffering
and nirvana. And in this case then Buddhas themselves would too
be circling around in the cycle of suffering. What then would the
use be for bodhisattvas to engage in the activities of a bodhisattva,
in order to achieve the state of Buddhahood? It would be totally
pointless.
And yet there is no such problem, for there exists a distinction between the
natural state of nirvana and that nirvana which consists of a state of purity
which occurs through circumstances.

The nirvana which comes by nature is not something which depends upon
one's practice of the path; this is because it is, rather, the very nature of
everything, whether they involve any practice of the path or not. The nirvana
which occurs through circumstances, and consists of becoming free of all
impurity, must be achieved through cutting off the process through which, in
a stream of births and deaths, a person circles around in the cycle of suffering.
And even though these things may have no nature of their own, it is still the
case that, unless you cut off the stream of conditions that bring them about, you
would find it impossible not only to end the cycle of suffering, but ever to
bring even simple illusions to a stop. On the other hand, it would be impossible
for the cycle of suffering to happen even in a deceptive way, if one were able to
cut off the stream of the conditions which bring it about: conditions such as
ignorance and the like.

Incidentally, in the argument that came before, one should answer in terms of
distinguishing between an ultimate nirvana and nirvana, but not with any
other reply. This is because the opponent in this case also accepts the principle
that Buddhas do not circle around in the cycle of suffering, whereas living
beings do.

How Do We See the Illusion?

,GNYIS PA SEMS TZAM PA'I 'DOD PA BYE BRAG TU DGAG PA LA 'DOD PA BRJOD PA DANG , DE DGAG PA'O,
Here is the second part: a more particular refutation, of the position of the
Mind-Only School. Here we will proceed in two steps: stating their position,
and then refuting it.

DANG PO NI, GAL TE CHOS THAMS CAD RANG BZHIN GYIS MED NA SGYU MA 'DZIN PA'I SHES PA 'KHRUL PA'ANG YOD PA MIN NA SGYU MA BLO GANG GIS DMIGS PAR 'GYUR TE, MI 'GYUR BAS SGYU MA'ANG MED PAR 'GYUR RO ZHE NA 'DI YANG YOD NA RANG BZHIN GYIS YOD DGOS SNYAM PA'I RTZOD PA'O,
Here is the first of the two. One may begin with the following objection:
If there is no object at all that has any nature of its own, then the
mistaken state of mind which perceives the illusion cannot exist
either. If this were so, then there would be no state of mind that
could ever take the illusion as its object. And if this were the
case, then the illusion itself could not exist either.
This argument too is another version of the idea that, if something exists, it
must have a nature of its own.

GNYIS PA LA RTZOD PA MTSUNGS PA DANG , DE'I LAN DGAG PA'O,
The second of the two has two sections of its own: a demonstration that the
same arguments apply to them instead, and then a refutation of their
attempted rebuttal in response to this demonstration.

,GANG TSE KHYOD LA SGYU MA NYID,
,MED NA'ANG DE TSE CI ZHIG DMIGS,
,GAL TE DE NYID DU GZHAN YOD,

You would say there'd also
Be no illusion itself;
On what then would it focus?
Suppose those same exist
In another way; the forms
Consist of the mind itself.

Here is the first. You of the Mind-Only School would say that, if things grasped
by the mind both appear to be outer objects and also actually exist the way
that they appear, then there must exist outer objects. In such a case then there
would be nothing that was like an illusion, and no state of mind that could
focus on it either. You would also say though that, if things that appeared to
be outer objects did not actually exist the way that they appear, then they
would have no nature; and then, according to you yourselves, these objects
could not exist at all. In this case then there would also be no illusion itself--that
is, no instance of the thing being grasped by mind appearing to be an outer
object. If this were the case, then what would it be that the mind was grasping
to--what would it be focusing upon? Because after all, there would also be no
state of mind at all that was grasping to visible objects, sounds, and so on.

GNYIS PA LA 'DOD PA BRJOD PA DANG , DE DGAG PA'O,
The second point has two steps of its own: stating the position of the Mind-
Only School, and then refuting this position.

DANG PO NI, KHO NA RE GAL TE PHYI ROL DON DU SNANG BA SNANG BA LTAR GYI DON DE NYID DU MED KYANG DE LAS GZHAN DU YOD DE GZUGS SOGS KYI RNAM PA DE NI SEMS NYID KYI RDZAS YIN NO ZHE NA,
Here is the first. The opponent may respond as follows:
Suppose it were true that the things which appear as outer objects
do not exist at all as those same objects, as what they appear to be.
Nonetheless they do exist in another way; that is, the forms that
they take, as visible objects and such, consist of the very substance
of the mind itself.

,GANG TSE SEMS NYID SGYU MA NA,
,DE TSE GANG ZHIG GANG GIS MTHONG ,
Suppose the mind itself
Had the illusory; what
Would then see such?

GNYIS PA LA, GNYIS MED KYI SHES PA GANG GIS KYANG MA MTHONG BA DANG , DRIS PA'I LAN GYI RANG RIG DGAG PA'O,
The second step too has two parts: asking the opponent how the realization
that there are no two things could itself ever be perceived by any state of
mind; and refuting the self-perception of the mind that they propose in answer
to our question.

DANG PO NI, GANG GI TSE SEMS NYID SGYU MA LTA BU'I DON DU SNANG BA YIN GYI PHYI ROL GYI DON MED NA DE'I TSE DON DANG BRAL BA'I SHES PA GANG ZHIG TSAD MA GANG GIS MTHONG STE MTHONG BYED MED PAR 'GYUR RO,
Here is the first. Suppose it were the case that the mind itself was both having
the appearance that there was this illusory object, but that there was in fact no
outer object. In such a case, then the mind would lack any object. What valid
perception then would there be to see just such a state of mind? There could
never exist then any state of mind that saw it.

Here is the second point, [which is refuting attempted argument about the
demonstration of how it is correct to say that, even though the Buddhas have
no conceptualization, they can still fulfill all the hopes of their disciples].
Now some Listeners have made the following argument:
Buddhas possess no conceptual state of mind, and so neither do
they have that conceptual state of mind in which one accepts an
offering. How then can we gain a meritorious result from making
offerings to them?

Isn't it though the case that, even though Buddhas have no conceptual state of
mind, we can still obtain merit through making offerings to them? You may
ask our reason for saying so; it is because of the explanation, found in the Sutra
on the Lion's Roar of Loving One, that whether a person makes an offering to a
Buddha who is actually present, or else makes the same offering to their tomb
after they have passed into nirvana, the merit from the act is exactly the same.

It is stated in the Word of the Buddha that it doesn't matter whether an act such
as making offerings to a Buddha exists deceptively or even in an ultimate way:
the result of making the offering still occurs. It's just the same, for example, as the
result that you yourselves believe would be obtained from making that same
offering to a Buddha who existed in truth. The point here is that, suppose we
leave for a moment any examination into the real nature of things. What we
are trying to say is that, regardless of whether the thing is true or false, we can
be satisfied simply with the fact that we obtain a result which corresponds
exactly to the object involved.

"One achieves liberation by

Without this path,
There is never enlightenment.

,GNYIS PA THAR PA TZAM THOB PAR 'DOD PAS KYANG STONG NYID RTOGS DGOS PAR BSGRUB PA LA, RTZOD PA DANG , LAN NO,
The second part--a proof that, even if all you hope to do is to reach freedom,

argument and our own response.

Here is the first. Some people from the Listener group make the following
claim:
One achieves liberation--the goal of becoming an enemy
destroyer--by habituating oneself to the experience of seeing,
directly, the sixteen aspects of the four truths: impermanence and
the rest. What though would be the point of seeing that all existing
objects were empty of any true existence? There would be no
purpose served; it could never be right.

There are other Listener groups who say that you don't even need to realize
emptiness in order to achieve enlightenment. And not only that; they don't
even accept the term "lack of any self-nature to things." Neither do they accept
that the sutras of the greater way are the word of the Buddha. These kinds of
people are the primary opponent in the present case. We are by the way
though also refuting here those people who do consider the sutras of the
greater way to be authentic, but who assert that one need not realize the lack
of a self-nature to things in order to achieve the goal of becoming an enemy
destroyer. The root text at this point is put here with the idea of refuting these
parties, and then expressing the position that it is only wisdom which can be
proven as the path to liberate oneself from a suffering existence.

The second step has three parts of its own: proving that it is only the wisdom
that realizes emptiness which is the path that can liberate one from a suffering
existence; proving that it is also only this wisdom which is the path for
reaching the nirvana where one no longer remains in the two extremes; and
advice to those who seek to attain liberation, that it is therefore very right that
they should meditate upon emptiness. The first of these has two sections:
proving this fact by using scripture to prove that the scriptures of the greater
way are the word of the Buddha; and proving the fact through logic.

Here is the first. It is true though that one must definitely realize emptiness
even to achieve the goal of becoming an enemy destroyer. This is because of
the fact that scriptural authority, in the form of the body of sutras devoted to
the perfection of wisdom, states that--without habituating oneself to this path,
where you realize emptiness--one can never reach the three "states of
enlightenment."

The Great Commentary to the Guide quotes the Sutra of the Mother as saying that
"those who still conceive of [self-existent] things" can never reach freedom; and
that reaching total enlightenment--as well as everything from the level of a
stream-enterer up to the state of a self-made "Buddha"--all depends upon this
one thing: the perfection of wisdom. The intent of the root text at this point
is to reflect these statements; it is not meant to indicate that this perfection is
needed only for the matchless state of enlightenment.

Here is the second point, [which is the absurd consequence that, if one could
reach the state of an enemy destroyer simply through the path of the sixteen
aspects of impermanence and the rest, then one would have to reach it through
nothing more than eliminating mental afflictions in their manifest form].
Someone may make the following claim:
It's not necessary that a person realize emptiness in order to
achieve the state of an enemy destroyer. It is rather through
habituating oneself to the path by which one realizes the sixteen
aspects of impermanence and so on that a person finally
eliminates all their mental afflictions, and thus attains liberation:
the goal of becoming an enemy destroyer.

You must be saying then that a person who eliminates, temporarily, nothing
more than the manifest form of mental afflictions becomes--in the next moment
after they eliminate such manifest forms--this enemy destroyer. Why so?
Because, according to you, a person is able to finish off their mental afflictions,
and thus attain the state of an enemy destroyer, by habituating themselves to
nothing more than the path of the sixteen aspects of impermanence and the
rest. The logic is completely the same, in every way.

And yet you cannot accept that this could be the case. Consider the kinds of
people who, temporarily, lack any manifest mental afflictions: those who have
eliminated no more than the manifest forms. We can see though that they still
possess the karmic power that would cause them to cross the border into their
next rebirth.

The lines in the root text that say "If one were liberated by eliminating
afflictions..." are a statement of the opponent's position; their purpose is similar
to the lines before that went, "One achieves liberation by seeing the truth." The
former lines should be explained as saying, "If a person eliminated their mental
afflictions, and thereby attained liberation, by means of meditating upon the path
of the sixteen aspects of impermanence and the rest..." This is because the
debate at this point is about whether or not one can attain liberation from the
mental afflictions solely by using the path of the sixteen aspects of
impermanence and the rest. Moreover, the fact that they should be explained
this way is totally obvious from the debate about liberation occurring "through
seeing the truth," and so on. As such, it is not at all the point of these lines to
say that, "Although we accept that the path of the sixteen aspects of
impermanence and the rest has the power to eliminate your mental afflictions,
this doesn't mean you are liberated then from every kind of suffering."

Suppose then that this path functions as follows: when one develops in their
mind the path described above, then it affects those thoughts which are
accepted by both the two Listener groups and by ourselves as being mental
afflictions--it stops them from operating in a manifest manner, temporarily.
If one were to posit that this constituted achieving a liberation wherein all
mental afflictions were finished off, then one would have to say that a person
had achieved a liberation where every impurity was finished off simply by
having eliminated, temporarily, the manifest form of the mental
afflictions--and this would have to happen in the very next moment after it.
The intent of the root text at this point is to refute this idea.

The fact that one cannot accept the position just stated is indicated in the lines
of the root text at this point which say, "They lack any mental afflictions; / We
can see though they still / Possess the karmic power." [If what you say is true,

possess the manifest form of mental afflictions, we can see that they will not

This is how one should explain the lines of the root text at this point. Some
commentaries though, and certain Tibetans, have explained them as saying:
Consider persons like Maudgalyayana and the realized being
"String of Fingers," who had no mental afflictions, but who still
had karma that they had collected earlier, when they were still
ordinary beings. We can see that this karma was still producing
a result and giving them suffering, so it is not true that they were
liberated right after losing their mental afflictions.
This interpretation of the lines though is not correct. The lines are not referring
to the ability of the karma to produce suffering in this present life, but rather
to its ability to project the person into another future life. The point is that,
because one has not yet stopped their ability to do this, then one has not yet
achieved liberation.

People who have not yet realized emptiness have failed to eliminate even the
slightest bit of that ignorance which consists of grasping to the true existence
of their feelings. As such, there will definitely grow within them the kinds of
craving brought about by their feelings; that is, the craving not to be separated
from feelings of pleasure, and the craving to be separated from feelings of
pain. Now those kinds of people that you say are enemy destroyers still
though possess the belief that feelings can exist by definition. But the fact is
that--so long as there remains in the continuum of any particular person a
manifest form of the state of mind which still possesses the tendency to look at
things as if they were true--then it is totally impossible that this person could
have put a stop to the manifest form of the craving which is instigated by this
tendency.

Here is the fourth point: [a demonstration of why, therefore, even those who
wish to achieve no more than freedom must still meditate upon emptiness].
Consider now the state of mind which still lacks the realization that the person
and his heaps are empty of any nature where they could exist by definition.
Even though people with this state of mind have succeeded temporarily in
stopping the manifest form of their mental afflictions, these manifest forms will
still come back again. It's just like staying in the deep meditation where you
[nearly] stop completely your tendency to draw any kind of distinctions. So
therefore one must definitely hold the position that anyone who might hope
to achieve the goal of becoming an enemy destroyer--much less an Omniscient
One--must still meditate upon the emptiness which refuses the subtle form of the
self-existent object, whose existence we deny.

Here is the third point, [which is advice to those who seek to attain liberation,
that it is therefore very right that they should meditate upon emptiness]. As
such--that is, as we have just explained--the case is that all these attempts to
overthrow those who accept the idea of emptiness are completely incorrect. They will
also be disproved by the various kinds of reasoning which we will present
later on. And so it is that even those who wish no more than to achieve the
"enlightenment" which is the goal of the Listener and "Self-Made Buddha"
tracks must still, beyond a shadow of a doubt, meditate upon emptiness, for the
following reason. The tendency to hold things as existing truly is that form of
ignorance, involved with mental affliction, which is the root of the circle of
suffering. And it is completely impossible to attain freedom unless one can
overthrow the existence of the object which this ignorance thinks it sees.

The wisdom which realizes emptiness is, moreover, the antidote for the darkness
of both the mental-affliction obstacles and the obstacles to knowledge. How could it
ever be then that--if you hoped to achieve quickly the state of omniscience, the

state where you end finally both the obstacles--you would neglect to go and
meditate upon emptiness? Without this, you would never be able to eliminate
even the seeds of the mental-affliction obstacles.

The seed for the obstacles to omniscience is the ultimate subtle mental potential
for things which involve mental affliction, and their manifest form is the
condition of things appearing to exist truly, and so on. It is wrong though to
say things like, if something appears to exist truly, it is then necessarily an
obstacle to omniscience.

We will now summarize our discussion. Someone might come and say, "This
thing you call emptiness is something that frightens me; I don't think I can
meditate on it." This thing we call the tendency to grasp to things as existing
truly though is the thing which we have identified as the main cause that creates
every kind of pain in this cycle of suffering. This is the thing you should feel
frightened about, this is the thing that should strike terror into your heart. Why
is it then that you feel any fear for the wisdom which realizes emptiness, for the
thing it is that will put a final end to all the pain of the cycle of suffering? It is
wrong for you to feel afraid about that very thing that ends all fear.

nature at all which exists by nature, how could there be anyone who is afraid in the
first place? Take this state of mind where you think that things have any
nature of their own, and turn it around: look inside, and think! You will come
to comprehend fully what it means when we say that nothing is itself at all, and
you will liberate yourself from every fear there could ever be.

The Two Kinds of Grasping to Self-Existence

The third major section is a detailed explanation of the different types of
reasoning used to prove emptiness. Here there are two divisions: a detailed
presentation of the types of reasoning used to prove that the person has no
self-nature; and a detailed presentation of the types of reasoning used to prove
that things have no self-nature.

DANG PO LA GSUM, LHAN SKYES KYI BDAG 'DZIN GYI ZHEN YUL DGAG PA DANG , KUN BRTAGS KYI BDAG DGAG PA DANG , BKAG PA LA RTZOD PA SPANG BA'O,
The first of these has two parts of its own: refuting the object believed in by
the innate tendency to grasp to some self-nature; refuting the self-nature
grasped to by the tendency which is learned; and disproving any attempted
argument concerning the refutations.

Here is the first. On this point, the difference between the learned and the
innate forms of the tendency to grasp things as true is as follows. What we
call the "innate" form of this grasping can focus either on the person or upon
the parts of the person. It is a state of mind that everyone has, whether their
opinions have been affected by any particular school of philosophy or not.
And it holds that things exist through some nature of their own--that they
exist by definition. It is not dependent on any logical examination of its object,
but rather comes up in the mind automatically.

   BDEN 'DZIN YIN YANG RIGS PA'I DPYAD PA ZHUGS PA LA LTOS NAS BDEN PAR GRUB PA 'THAD SNYAM PA DANG , BDEN PA GRUB SNYAM PA NI BDEN 'DZIN KUN BRTAGS YIN LA,
An intellectual grasping to things as being true is a type of grasping to true
existence, but one which does rely on engaging in a logical analysis, and which
then concludes that it is correct to say that things do exist in truth, and so
believes in this kind of existence.

Regarding the tendency to grasp to the person as having some self-nature,
there does also exist a type where one holds the person as being self-standing
and substantial; this is taken in by the innate type just mentioned. You should
understand though that the tendency of looking upon the person and his parts
as being like a master and his servants can only be an intellectual type. In the
same way, the tendency to hold that there exists an atomic particle which is
partless, as well as the tendency to hold that there exists a moment of
consciousness which is partless, can both only be an intellectual type of the
tendency to hold that objects [meaning the parts of a person] have some self-
nature.

In brief, the two forms of the kind of tendency to grasp to things as existing
truly which comes in the mind automatically, without relying on analysis
according to some philosophical school, are the innate type. All the other
tendencies to hold that things have some self-nature are the intellectual kind.
It should be understood that the principal object which we deny when we
speak of emptiness is the object that the former tendency believes in;
disproving the object believed in by the latter tendency is ancillary to
disproving that believed in by the former.

One may make the following objection:
Here you are attempting to disprove the fact that the teeth and
nails and so on could be a self. If you are doing so with the idea
that it could liberate someone, then you are mistaken, since living
beings tend to hold these things as being "mine," and not as
being "me."

The point here is the same as in places where, for example, it's stated that the
physical body is not the self. As such, the things focused upon for the two
objects that are pictured in the mind during the innate form of the view of
destruction are the simple "me" which serves as the basis for the workings of
karma and its consequences, as well as the simple thing which is delineated as
"mine." The view of destruction focuses upon these things and believes them
to be a "me" and "mine" which exist by definition. Given all this, then if the
"me" were to exist by definition, it would also be true that the collection of the
heaps, and their continued existence, and all its components and parts, and
anything completely separate from these things at all, any of them, would have
to constitute what "me" refers to. The fact though is that none of these things
constitutes anything of the kind. This is what is being expressed at this point.

Here is our refutation that the individual members of the various heaps could
ever be what "myself" refers to. Neither my teeth nor nails are myself; the bones
and blood are not what "myself" refers to; neither is the snot, nor the phlegm; all
these are, rather, only something which the idea of a "me" is imposed upon,
and nothing more. Nor is the lymph, nor the pus, what "me" refers to; and the
fat and particles of the body are nothing that "myself" refers to either--for the
exact same reasons that we mentioned earlier.

Neither are the lungs or the liver what "myself" refers to, nor are any of the other
organs, like the intestines, what "myself" refers to either. I am not my feces,
nor my urine; I am neither the flesh nor skin; all I am is an idea imposed upon
all these, nothing more. Neither the warmth of the body nor the inner winds
are myself, and I am not the aperture in me, or anything of the kind--we must
decide, finally, that I am none of them.

These points may be summarized as follows. Those who belong to the
Functionalist group hold the heaps to be the thing which "person" refers to.
The non-Buddhists assert that the person is like the master, and the heaps like
the servants; that is, they accept a person which is substantially different from
the heaps.

The presentation here is making exactly the same point as the refutation, found
in the String of Precious Jewels for the Middle Way, where it is denied that the six
categories could ever be the person himself. The word "aperture" is used to
deny the idea that the category called "space" could be a person either.

Therefore it would be wrong to consider, even nominally, either the whole of
the parts of a person, or the stream of the mind, or any of the components or
parts of a person to be the thing we refer to as the "person." Neither is there
anything that can we decide is the person and which is essentially different
from these things. Therefore the simple fact of the matter is that the person is
something which is merely imposed upon all these.

Someone may make the following objection:
If that's the case, then we could never find any person at all!
Are you saying then that it's not all right to talk about a "John" or a "Joe" or
anything of the like without going into some analysis about their nature?
Suppose you do accept the existence of a person who was the object referred
to by the term "person," and who also existed by definition. It's important for
you to understand that you would then be falling into either the extreme of
believing that all things are unchanging, or that they have discontinued
completely. As such, there is not a single atom of any such person at all.

The third part, [disproving any attempted argument concerning the refutations

argument.

Here is the first. Someone may make the following objection:
Suppose that there exists no self which is the basis of all things,
whether they are part of the condition of bondage or part of the
condition of liberation. If it is true that each and every thing that
does something goes through a process of appearing and
disappearing instant by instant, then it is completely wrong to
postulate some relationship between good and bad karma and the
corresponding consequences. This is because, if it were true that
a person disappeared in the instant after he or she had done some
good or bad deed, then later on it would be impossible to say
whose karma it would be--what person there was who had
committed it. And this is because, when it was time to
experience the consequence of the karma, there would be no
person left who had committed it. This is why, according to us,
there must exist a person who is unchanging.

Here is the second. Both of us accept the fact that the basis, or the person, at the
time of the commission of a karma (meaning, in this context, at the time of the
cause) and at the time when the result is experienced is essentially different. We
both also accept that--at this time when the result is experienced--the "self," in
the sense of the person who committed the karma, is not something that exists
any longer. So isn't your argument here, at this point where we are discussing
the relationship between karma and its consequences, something which is
meaningless? Don't you also accept the fact that, at the time one is committing
the karma, the experience of the result does not yet exist, and--at that time
that one is experiencing the result--the one who committed the karma no

If there is any problem with this train of thought, then the same problem
applies to you. And if you say you can see that, when we have the cause (meaning
at the time of the cause or whatever) then we also have the experience of its
result, you are talking about something which is completely impossible.

"Well then," you may continue, "what is your own position in this regard?" We
can point to someone as--that is, name someone as--"the one who performs the
karma" and "the one who experiences the result" all with reference to a single
continuous stream of the parts or heaps to a person. The term "continuous
stream" here refers to a whole, the person to whom the various parts belong;
and these parts are the moments of them that exist earlier, later, and in
between, and which belong to the person. To summarize, it is entirely correct
to say that any one person has both committed a karma and experienced its
consequences; it's not the case though that cause and effect are then
simultaneous--no one could ever show that was the case.

A person's mind which is already past in time, and that which is future, cannot be

of self which you assert exists, because it would disappear in the following

Think for example of a hollow reed: when you strip away the stem piece by piece,
you find in the end that there is nothing with any nature at all. Here it's
exactly the same: you use logic to try to find out whether things have any nature
of their own or not, and come to the conclusion that there is no "myself" that
you could ever correctly decide existed. The idea that such a self could exist is
disproved totally by the various reasonings used, as I will describe below, to
establish that nothing has any self-nature at all.

,GAL TE SEMS CAN YOD MIN NA,
,SU LA SNYING RJE BYA ZHE NA,
,'BRAS BU'I DON DU KHAS BLANGS PA'I,
,RMONGS PAS BRTAGS PA GANG YIN PA'O,
One might ask, "If there's no
Such thing as a living being, then
Who do we have compassion for?"
It is those projected by dark
Ignorance, those asserted
For attaining the goal.

GNYIS PA NI, GAL TE SEMS CAN RANG BZHIN GYIS GRUB PA 'GA' YANG YOD PA MIN NA SU LA SNYING RJE BSGOM PAR BYA STE SNYING RJE'I DMIGS YUL MED PA'I PHYIR RO ZHE NA,
Here is the second point, [disproving the idea that it would be incorrect to
meditate upon compassion]. One might begin by asking the following question:
If there is no such thing as a living being who has any nature of
their own, then who are we supposed to think of when we
meditate upon compassion? The compassion would have no
object upon which to focus.

But there is no such problem: it's not true that compassion would have no
object to focus upon if there were no living being who had any nature of their
own. This is because it is completely proper, for the purposes of attaining the
goal of freedom, to assert the existence of those living beings who exist
nominally--that is, living beings who are projected by dark ignorance.
Suppose now that we interpret the words "projected by dark ignorance" as
referring to the tendencies to believe that the person and that things have some
self-nature. These tendencies project onto living beings a quality of true
existence; we deny that they actually exist in the way that they are projected
to be, and so we are not denying the idea of a living being itself. Thus too it
is that we can establish the existence of a living being, one which is only a
projection, one which exists only in name.

,YANG NA RMONGS PA MA RIG PA TZAM LA BYAS NAS DES BTAGS PAR GYUR PA'I SEMS CAN SNYING RJE'I DMIGS YUL DU YOD CES PA'O,
The phrase "projected by dark ignorance" can also be read as referring to
ignorance alone, in which case the words are saying, "It is living beings
projected by this state of mind which are the object upon which compassion
focuses."
 , SEMS CAN MED 'BRAS SU YI YIN,

One may continue with the following question:
If there is no such thing as a living being, then what person is it
who could ever consider enlightenment--that is, the result of
meditating upon compassion--to be something you could ever
achieve? The meditation then would become something
pointless.
It's true that this cause and effect have no true existence; but there's no
contradiction when we say that one may still meditate upon compassion, and
anything of the like, in a nominal way, in a way where one is unaware of the
real nature of things.

That egotism which is the
Cause of pain then feeds it,
For it's ignorant about the self.
Suppose you object, "That doesn't
Mean you could stop it"; meditation
On lack of a self is supreme.

One may ask the following question: "Why is it that you said, before, that both
dark ignorance and the object it thinks it sees can be stopped?" There was a
section earlier on in the text where we spoke of "that which is the cause of all
pain." As we did there, we are here speaking of that "egotism"--meaning the
state of ignorance involved with mental affliction--which is the cause of all the
pain of this suffering existence. This state of mind is in a condition of dark
ignorance about the nature of the self, and this is what allows it to feed our pain
in the cycle of suffering. This is the reason why we must stop it, and also the
reason why it is no contradiction to say that we can stop it.

Suppose you make the following objection:
Even if you could stop this kind of dark ignorance, that doesn't
mean that you could stop the tendency to see things as existing
truly. In fact you couldn't; and even if you did stop it once, it
would never be ended forever: the tendency would come back
again, the way that the heaps of a person come back in this
suffering cycle.

And yet it's not true that you cannot put an end to the tendency of seeing
things as existing truly. Remember that this tendency is a misperception of the
true nature of things. As such it is weak, and inferior; whereas meditating upon
the lack of a self-nature to things is, by comparison, supreme. Since this
meditation is a completely unmistaken realization into the true suchness of all
things, it has the power to rip the other perception out from the very roots.

Here is the second major division of the discussion: a detailed presentation of
the types of reasoning used to prove that things [meaning here the parts of a
person, as opposed to the person themselves,] have no self-nature. We proceed
in three steps: an explanation of the fact that things have no self-nature,
utilizing the four different forms of deep awareness; disproving any contention
that the two truths would be incorrect; and setting forth logical proofs to
demonstrate that there is no self-nature.

DANG PO LA BZHI, LUS DRAN PA NYE BAR GZHAG PA BSGOM PA DANG , TSOR BA DRAN PA NYE BAR GZHAG PA DANG , SEMS DRAN PA NYE BAR GZHAG PA DANG , CHOS DRAN PA NYE BAR GZHAG PA BSGOM PA'O,
The first of these has four parts of its own: meditating on deep awareness of
one's body; meditating on deep awareness of one's feelings; meditating on deep
awareness of one's mind; and meditating on deep awareness of objects.

The first of these as well has four sections: establishing the fact that the body
as a whole has no nature; establishing the fact that its parts, its components,
have no nature; why it is therefore completely wrong to feel attachment for the
body, something which has no nature, and which is like a dream; and how this
also proves that the person has no nature either.

Here is the first. It is not the case that the body has any nature of its own.
This is because, if it did, then when we looked for the thing we refer to as "the
body" we would have to find it to be one of the following: either the individual
components of the body, or the sum total of these parts, or something
essentially different from these. And yet we cannot find it to be any of these.

DGOS PAR 'GYUR RO,
One might make the following objection:
We would rather concede that the sum total of all its components
is the body. What problem could you ever have about this?
The body is a concept formed upon the basis of the collection of the parts; as
such, it would be incorrect to say that this collection of the parts of the body
were the body itself. If you say otherwise, then ultimately you would have to
accept the idea of an ultimate in the form of atoms that were partless.

Suppose then that we seek the thing it is that we refer to with the word
"body," looking for something which exists from its own side. Neither the foot
nor the calf of a person is the body of the person, nor is the thigh or the waist.
Neither as well is the front or the back of the body the body, for "body" is a
concept applied to these things. The chest and the shoulders are not the body, nor
are the ribcage or the arms. The side under the arm is not the body, and the
shoulder above the arm is not the body. Nor are the inner organs the person's
body. Nor finally is the head or the neck this person's body. Where then in any
of these components would the body ever be? It is none of them. Neither is it
the sum of these parts, nor is it something which is essentially separate from
them. And so therefore the body is nothing that has any nature of its own.

Here is the second point, [establishing the fact that the body's parts, the
components, have no nature]. Think of the way in which the body of a person
is just a concept applied to the collection of its components. The hand too then
is just the same: a concept applied to the collection of its various pieces, to its
fingers. So how then could it ever be something that had some nature of its own?
It would be a complete impossibility.

Each finger, in turn, is a concept applied to the collection of the joints that make
it up--and so they too have no nature of their own. And if you examine each
of the joints as well, if you divide the joints each into their various parts, you find

they have no nature of their own either. And then you can take each of the
parts of these wholes and divide them all the way down to their atoms, and find
that none of them has any nature of its own.

And even these atoms can be divided then into their own parts: into their eastern
side, and so on. They too then are a concept applied to the collection of the
multiple sides that face in the different directions, and so they have no nature of
their own either. You can even divide the directions themselves, which have
no nature of their own either. Things then are devoid of any parts that have any
nature of their own; and so they are just like, for example, empty space.

And thus it is that atoms themselves have no nature of their own; for if they

that begin with "Suppose the six [sides in the six directions] were stuck

Contemplation Thirty
The Emptiness of the Mind

,YID NI DBANG RNAMS LA MI GNAS,

The mind doesn't reside in the faculties,
Nor in the visual or the rest,
Nor somewhere in between.

Here is the third section, which is meditating on deep awareness of one's mind.
We proceed in two steps: demonstrating the fact that consciousness of the
mind cannot exist by nature; and demonstrating the fact that the other five
kinds of consciousness cannot exist by nature.

Here is the first. The mind is not something which has any nature of its own,
and this is because of the following reasons:
(1) It does not reside, through any nature of its own, within the six
faculties;
(2) It is not something which resides, through any nature of its own,
within the six objects of visual matter or the rest; and
(3) It is not something which resides "somewhere in between" these
two--meaning in the combination of the two.
For this point one should recall the seven points in the analysis of a wagon, as
found in Entering the Middle Way. [These are examining a wagon to see
whether it is self-existently:
(1) its parts (in which case it would have to be as many as its parts);
(2) something unrelated to its parts (in which case it would be some
externally existing "self," and no longer be a changing thing);
(3) something that depends upon its parts (in which case their
relationship would have to be that of two completely separate
things, like a bowl and the yogurt in the bowl--since the thing
dependent was a self-existent other);
(4) something that its parts depend upon (similar problem);

(5) something that possesses its parts (again, something completely
other than its parts, if it "possesses" them);
(6) the sum of its parts (independent of our projections, which cannot
be); or
(7) some special visual outline of the wagon (if this were true, then the
mental heaps, since they are not physical matter and cannot have
shape or color, could not be included in the "person" or his
"mind").]

Consider the so-called "inner agent," the "inner person" that the non-Buddhist
schools say exists. The mind cannot, through some nature of its own, reside in
this sense "inside," nor can it reside somewhere outside--in the hand or the like.
Neither can it be found, through some nature of its own, to be somewhere else
than the inside or the outside.
Think of a mind that had some nature of its own: one that was neither the body
nor truly something other than the body: think of a mind that was neither mixed
with the body nor an independent thing, isolated from the body. No such thing
exists. And because it lacks even the slightest bit of any natural way of being, the
mind is completely empty of any nature of its own: and this itself is what we
refer to as the "natural state of nirvana."

Here is the first. The non-Buddhist school known as "Those who Reject the
World," and other such groups as well, note the fact that there are things--like
the patterns on a peacock--which don't seem as if anyone at all has made
them; they say:
Consider the roughness of a lotus petal, and its texture or other
such qualities; think as well of the sharpness of a thorn, or the
like. They just happen by their own nature; it's not as if someone
made them that way.
Your idea though is incorrect. This is because we can most often see--even with
that direct perception which is shared throughout the world--all the causes that
create the vast majority of inner and outer working things, such as crops and
the like. And the great variety of results--that is, things like the colors of the
stem of a lotus, or the number of petals it has--are all caused by a great variety
of different causes. If you ask what it is then that causes all the different varieties
of causes themselves; the answer is that they come from none other than a previous
set of a great variety of causes.

One may ask the following question:
Just how is it that a variety of causes can create a variety of results?
There's no problem though with the idea: it's not as though they have no such
power. It is precisely due to the power of the causes that came before them that a
variety of causes is able to create a variety of individual results. This allows
us then to state the following proof:

(1) Consider all these working things.
(2) It is not the case that they have no causes, because
(3) We can observe that they grow intermittently, in time
and space.
[Please note that the mi 'dra na of the Tibetan should almost surely be read as
mi 'dra ba, although both editions of the text available to us repeat this spelling.
The meaning remains the same in either case.]

What Emptiness is Empty Of

One may make the following objection:
For this very reason, it is wrong to say that the meditation upon
emptiness which you propose is perfectly correct; the valid
perception which perceives it is, after all, "deceptive."
We answer with a logical proof--
(1) Consider the entire body of existing phenomena.
(2) It is absolutely correct for us to assert both that the
valid perception which perceives emptiness is itself
deceptive, and that the emptiness which it
establishes as existing is also deceptive, because

(3) When you understand, through the process of
conceptualization, the refutation wherein we deny
the existence of a working thing which exists in
truth, you rely upon forming a mental image of the
object whose existence we deny.

One would never be able to
Grasp how something was
Devoid of being a thing
Without encountering that
Thing it was which one
Imagined it to be.
For this reason, the fact that the
Deceptive thing is not a thing
Is something clearly deceptive.

And this really is the case, because one would never be able to grasp, through the
process of conceptualization, how something was devoid of being a thing (how it
lacked any true existence) unless one was first able to "encounter" (or
conceptualize) that thing it was which one "imagined it to be" (meaning true
existence); that is, unless one was first able to form a mental picture of what
it was like to exist in truth. And for this reason--which means, because of the
fact that the "deceptive thing" or object we deny is totally impossible--then the
condition that remains when we have denied the existence of this object
(meaning the fact that this object is not a thing) is itself something which is
clearly deceptive.

,SNGA MA'I DPE NI RTOG PA LA MO SHAM BU'I RNAM PA MA SHAR BAR MO SHAM BU SHI BA'I RNAM PA MI 'CHAR BA BZHIN NO,
Here is an example to illustrate what we have just been talking about. Until
such time as you are able to form a mental picture of the child of a barren
woman, you can never form a picture of this same child dying.

Consider the condition that remains after you have disproved the object that
we deny: that is, the fact that there is no true existence. If this itself existed
truly, then the image of the emptiness of true existence which presents itself
to the mind working in a logical mode would itself have to exist in truth. It's
moreover the case (1) that it is impossible for a collection of parts to be there
when any one of its parts has been disproved; and (2) that, since the object we
deny appears to exist in truth, this appearance of true existence would itself
have to exist truly. And if this were all true, then true existence itself would
have to be something that existed. But since it doesn't exist, then the voidness
of true existence which remains after it has been disproved is itself something
which is deceptive, rather than being something which exists in truth. This is
the point being made in lines from Root Wisdom like the one which says, "If
there were the least thing that were not empty, then..."
[The full popularized form of the lines being referred to by Gyaltsab Je reads:
If there were the least thing that were not empty,
Then how could emptiness itself exist?
The point is that, if emptiness itself were not empty, then nothing else could
be either.]

Therefore when a child dies
In a dream, the state of mind which
Imagines that he's gone blocks out
The state of mind imagining that

That it's all deceptive.

Unless one is able to form a mental image of what it would be like for
something to exist in truth, one can never understand the emptiness of this
true existence well. Therefore those who hope to understand emptiness must
become masters of the art of defining for themselves just what the object we
deny is.
Therefore, for this reason, think of the example of a dream in which you see your
child die. The state of mind where you imagine that the child is gone blocks out the
state of mind where you imagine that the child is still there, despite the fact that the
state of mind being eliminated and the state of mind that works against it are
both just deceptive, just a dream.

Here our case is the same. It is absolutely no contradiction to say that a
corrective state of mind which is deceptive can destroy an undesirable state of
mind which is also deceptive, or that a valid perception which is deceptive can
perceive an object which is also deceptive.
Those of the non-Buddhist school called the "Numerists," on the other hand,
assert that all knowable objects exist in truth; and so they don't understand
how to establish the existence of a valid perception which is deceptive. The
problems you have raised therefore don't apply equally to us.

Here is the third section, the proof based on refuting that neither a thing which
does nor does not exist could ever grow. This section itself has three steps:
making the proof, and thus refuting the idea that the arising of things could
exist by nature; using this same proof to disprove that the ending of things
could exist by nature; and showing how this proves that suffering existence
and the state of peace have one quality which is totally equivalent.

Here is the first. Suppose that working things had some nature of their own.
What need then would there be for causes? They wouldn't have to make anything
grow. And even if these results didn't exist, then what need again would there be
for causes? They would never be able to make anything grow either.
Incidentally, the fact is that no result at all ever exists at the time that its cause
is present, and this is invariably the way that things grow; so this is not what
we are denying in the present case. Rather, we are denying that something
that could never exist at all could grow.

And suppose next that we are denying that a result which did exist could
grow. What we deny in this case is the kind of result that the Numerists
posit--one that could exist at the time of its cause; as well as the result which
the majority of schools accept, which is one that could have any nature of its
own. To say though that "Because something has already grown, it is not
necessary for the cause to make it grow," would be beyond all logic. The point
then is that we are asserting that cause and effect are empty of any nature of
their own; that they are like an illusion, or the reflection of an image in the
mirror.

What follows next is a proof that a thing without any function could never be
the object of the functioning of a cause. In this regard, someone might make
the following claim:
Since a result that already existed would already have occurred,
there would be no need for its cause to produce it. Why though
is it that you say a result which does not exist cannot occur?
The fact though is that you could have literally billions of causes involved, but you
could still never turn something that was not a functioning thing into something
that was: there is nothing at all that could ever make something that was not
a functioning thing into something that was.

And if you say it is possible, then let us ask you a question. When this
happens, then which of the following is the case: does the thing which is not
functioning not lose its condition of being something which does not function,
or does it? If you say it does not, then how can you claim that the condition of
not functioning could become a thing that did function? After all, the condition
of being able to perform a function is something completely inconsistent with
the condition of being unable to perform a function.

And suppose you say the latter, [that it does lose its condition, and becomes
something else;] this is impossible, because there are only two ways that
something could become a functioning thing: either from being a functioning
thing, or from being a thing which doesn't function. No other one is possible.

Suppose moreover that the thing which doesn't function does not lose its
condition of being a thing which doesn't function when it is the object of a
cause. It is completely impossible for anything to be a functioning thing while it
is a thing which does not function. When then do you imagine it could be that
this became a functioning thing? A functioning thing could never grow so long
as the thing was something that didn't function.

Suppose again that it became a functioning thing after it did lose its condition
of being a thing which didn't function. Until such time as the functioning thing
was produced, it could never lose its condition of being a thing which didn't
function; but until such time as it did lose the condition of not functioning, it is an
impossibility that it could take on the condition of having a function--for the two
conditions are mutually exclusive.

were half something that functioned and half something that didn't function,
then a single thing would have to have two different natures, and this again is
impossible.
This same kind of reasoning can be used for disproving both the idea that
something which didn't exist at all could grow, and the idea that any of the
things which have no function could ever grow.

Disproving the idea that something which does not exist at the time of its

Here is the second point, [which is using this same proof to disprove that the
ending of things could exist by nature]. With the foregoing we have explained
how the arising of things could never have any nature of its own. It is equally
true that the ending of things is not something which has any nature of its own.
Neither is any functioning thing anything which has any nature of its own. And
for this reason we can say that all of the events of the world are things that have
never either begun or ended through any nature of their own; they are nothing but
peace--that is, what we call "nirvana by nature."

Here is the third point, [which is showing how all this proves that our
suffering existence and the state of peace have one quality which is totally
equivalent]. The events of this suffering life are like a dream; this is because they
lack the slightest bit of any nature of their own, and yet still exhibit all the
workings of actions and the objects of actions, without any confusion of the
two. If you analyze these events with the logic that examines suchness, then you
find that they are just like a hollow piece of cane: although they appear to have
some substantial existence, they lack even the tiniest bit of any essence, any
nature of their own.

Here is the milepost for checking whether or not what you are doing qualifies
as an examination into suchness. Suppose you decide not to be satisfied just
with an object which is no more than something created by concepts,
something that exists only nominally. If you resolve then to go and seek the
thing which your concept or term applies to, then what you are doing qualifies
as an examination into suchness. And suppose that you proceed in the other
way--that is, suppose you decide to simply remain satisfied with the fact that
something is no more than a creation of terms or projections. If you then
proceed to examine how it is that John goes, or stays, or anything of the like,
then you are performing what we would call an analysis into terms or
projections.

Where would pleasure or pain
Ever come from? How could
There be what you want or don't?
If you look from this point of view,
Who feels the craving,
And what is it they crave for?

How could anyone ever do you any honor then, or any insult either? How could
they ever help you, or hurt you? What would there be to strive to get? What
would there be to work to get rid of? Where would pleasure or pain ever come
from? What could ever cause them? How could there ever be the things you
don't want, or the things you do want? How could there ever be anything with
its own nature that made you happy, or made you unhappy?
Use the logic where you examine the true nature of things. If you look at it from
this point of view, you see that none of the three elements in a situation has any

nature of its own: When you crave something, where is the fact of craving?
And who is it that is feeling the craving? And what is it that they feel the craving
for?

You should in this same way analyze karma, the person collecting the karma,
and so on. When you look at all these beings, all those who are alive in the
world, who is it then that dies here in this suffering existence? Death itself is
nothing that has any nature of its own.
Who is it that is going to come and take the future life? Who is it that went and
took the last life? Who is the relative that is helping you so much? Who is the
friend you feel so attracted to? None of them has the least nature of their own.
You must thus come to comprehend the real nature of things, and make great
efforts to neutralize the eight worldly thoughts within you.

[The eight worldly thoughts consist of having the following emotions, based on
a misperception of reality:
1) Being happy when we acquire some thing,
2) And unhappy when we don't.
3) Being happy when we feel good,
4) And unhappy when we don't.
5) Being happy when we become well known,
6) And unhappy when we don't.
7) Being happy when someone speaks well of us,
8) And unhappy when someone speaks ill of us.]

Here is the third point, [which is a description of the way in which great
compassion thinks of its object]. Consider then how, in the way described
above, merciless suffering comes to the minds of all these beings; think well
upon the way of torment, the way in which they are tortured by pain.
Focusing upon those beings who are caught in the fire of this suffering, think to
yourself this way:
When is it that I will be able to help put an end to the suffering they
all feel in the lower realms? When will the clouds of my good
deeds, my acts of giving and the rest, send down upon them a
great rain of every goodness: all the things I have that keep me well
in life--medicine, food, and all the rest?
[Please note that the texts available to us seem to read here 'tsogs
chas kyis, an ancient word for "with the necessities of life," rather
than the tsogs char gyis, of the root text, meaning "with the rain
of my collection of good karma." The translation reflects both
readings.]
Meditate on great compassion, by thinking this way too:
What if it were true that everyone in the lower realms could be
freed from all their pain? May they be freed! May I free them
myself!

Here is a prayer that we become the cause for their liberation from suffering:
When is it that I will come to realize that every single object which
exists is completely devoid of any nature of its own? When will
I come to have the wisdom that has no focus [towards things as self-
existent]? And when will I, with great respect, go about the task
of accumulating infinite masses of merit, acts of giving and the rest,
using this wisdom as a method to achieve the goals?
Living beings are all devastated here in the cycle of suffering by
their tendency to focus on things and believe that they have some
true existence. When is it that I will be able to teach them the
concept of emptiness, in order to help them put a stop to all the
sufferings of the cycle?
Meditate thus on great compassion, think to yourself:
What if it were true that every living being could be freed from
the sufferings of this cycle of life? May I free them myself!

For the love and compassion which is a part of the path of the greater way to
be complete in every respect, you must have the desire that you could move
every living being to the state of enlightenment itself: that you could assure

their coming to possess every kind of happiness, and avoiding every kind of
pain.

To summarize, we must undertake to meditate upon the real nature of things,
basing this analysis upon the practice of meditative quietude. The "me" you
think of when you say "it's mine" is nothing more than a projection that you
lay on the heaps or parts that make you up. It has not the slightest bit of any
natural existence, of any definitive existence, of any independent way of being.
The existence of a person is something which happens only by virtue of an
idea; the person exists only through projections, only in dependence on other
things, and nothing more. Practice thinking of things this way: see that they
have no nature of their own. Continue in your meditation, applying this same
concept to every existing object: to the parts of a person, and everything else
as well.

Here is the fourth major section, which is an explanation of how to train
oneself in the perfection of giving, where you give away your body,
possessions, and all your collected virtue; this explanation is accomplished
through presenting the part [of the seven parts for collecting virtue and
purifying negativities] known as "dedication." Here there are two steps: an
explanation of the text of the chapter, and an explanation of its name.

Here is the first. "I," meaning the author of this commentarial classic, "have
thus finished composing a very thorough guide to the way of life followed by
bodhisattvas. It expresses the entire contents of the highest of all spoken words:
it incorporates a description of the entire path for reaching Buddhahood,

including an explanation of this result itself; that is, it shows how to actually
put into practice every one of the steps of the path designed for people of three
different scopes. I hereby dedicate all the virtue that I have achieved through
this act, as well as all the virtue that anyone may ever obtain through teaching,
or learning, or thinking about the meaning of this book. Through this virtue,
may every living being engage in--that is actually practice, properly--the
bodhisattva's way of life."

The Sutra Requested by Ocean of Wisdom states,
Think of drops of water as they fall into the great salt sea;
Until the ocean itself dries up, the drops never disappear.
Virtuous acts that are dedicated in whole to enlightenment
Are the same, and never finish until Buddhahood is attained.
As we pointed out above, dedication has the further benefit that virtues which
would have produced only a minor result give forth instead effects which are
immense. And virtues that would have at some point worn out if they had not
been dedicated become never-ending, and ever-increasing. Think well on these
fine qualities of dedication; take even the very smallest good deeds that you
ever do, and make great efforts to dedicate them to reaching matchless
enlightenment for the sake of every living being.

The sutras on the perfection of wisdom are making this same point when they
say,
Your entire core of virtue should be dedicated exclusively to the
state of All Knowing alone; never engage in making dedication
of them to the levels of a Listener, or a Self-Made Buddha.

Moreover this virtue, as explained in the ninth chapter, must be performed in
such a manner that it is imbued with the wisdom which perceives the fact that
none of the three elements has any true existence. Admittedly there is no great
difference between the act of dedication and that of prayer. Nonetheless, an
act of prayer can be described as something characterized by a kind of
aspiration in which you hope for some goal, something that you wish to
happen. Dedication, on the other hand, is something characterized by a kind
of aspiration in which you hope that virtues, from their causal point of view,
might become a cause for some particular result to occur.

the single medicine, and a matchless medicine, for curing every pain

happiness that living kind ever experiences. I pray that they may

This final chapter is characterized by the act of dedication, in which virtues are
transformed by fierce feelings of aspiration expressed in prayers for temporal
and ultimate goals. As such, it represents a detailed explanation of how we
train ourselves in that type of generosity where we give away our bodies,
possessions, and the virtues we have collected, all in order to help others.
Earlier on in the text too there were occasional explanations of how to train
oneself in the perfection of giving. We can say therefore that there is no single
entire chapter which covers how to train oneself in giving.

The Asian Classics Institute
Course XVIII: The Great Ideas of Buddhism, Part Three
Reading Five: The Art of Reasoning, Part One
The following readings on the art of reasoning are divided into one of three different
categories. The first type is composed of selections from what are known as the
"Collected Topics," a summary of the Buddhist teachings on logic and perceptual
theory. The second group are selections on the forms of logic, and the third collection
describes how both these subjects have been debated in Tibetan monasteries over many
centuries of time.
*************
Selection from the collected topics:
Why study the art of reasoning?
Unless otherwise noted, the selections on the collected topics are excerpted from a
monastic textbook entitled An Explanation of the Science of Logic, included in the
Advanced Path of Reasoning, a Section from the "Key to the Logic Machine"--a
Presentation of the Collected Topics which Clarifies the Meaning of the Great
Scriptures on Valid Perception (Tsad-ma'i gzhung-don 'byed-pa'i bsdus-grva'i
rnam-par bshad-pa rigs-lam 'phrul gyi lde'u-mig las rigs-lam che-ba rtags-rigs kyi
skor). This text was written by Purbuchok Jampa Tsultrim Gyatso (1825-1901), who
in his day held the position of Tutor to the Dalai Lama.
***************
Our first selection discusses the importance of learning how to reason well:

RGYU BSAM SBYOR PHUN TSOGS NI NYAMS SU BLANG BYA'I LAM RNAM DAG TU RTOG GE'I TSIG DON BRGYAD KYI SGO NAS SGRUB PAR MDZAD, DES NA SGRUB NGAG DANG , SUN 'BYIN GYI RNAM BZHAG LA MKHAS PA'I SGO NAS RGYAL BA'I BSTAN PA 'DZIN PA DE NI, BSTAN 'DZIN GYI GTZO

The causes that create the Buddha are consummate thoughts and actions.
Proving that these constitute a totally pure path that we should practice is
accomplished by using the eight different forms of logic. As such there is but
one main way of keeping the teachings of the victorious Buddha safe in the
world, and this is to become a master of the logical forms used to prove some
things and to disprove others. As the Goldmine of Reasoning [by the Sakya
Pandita, Kunga Gyeltsen (1182-1251)] says,
Suppose a person comes to understand
The scriptural tradition for how to reason:
This art of proving or disproving things.
A master like this is a person who keeps
The teachings of the totally enlightened
Buddhas safe here in the world.
***************
The second selection is a very famous quotation from scripture which is memorized by
every young monk who begins the geshe course in a Tibetan monastery. It describes
one of the ultimate reasons for studying the art of reasoning:

MDO LAS, GANG ZAG GIS GANG ZAG GI TSOD GZUNG BAR MI BYA STE, NYAMS PAR GYUR TE RE, ZHES RANG LA MI SNANG BA TZAM GYIS GZHAN LA YON TAN DE LTA BU MED CES 'CHAD MI RIGS PA'I DON STON PA LA, RNAM 'GREL LAS, TSAD MA RNAMS NI MI 'JUG PA, MED LA MI 'JUG 'BRAS BU CAN, ZHES SOGS KYIS BSTAN,
There is a sutra where it says,
No person should ever judge another; those who try will fall.
The point of these words is to show us how wrong it is for us to say that
someone else lacks any particular good quality, only because it does not appear
to us that they do. This same point is made in the Commentary with lines such
as the following:

In a case where valid perception has yet
To engage in the object, the result obtained
Is that they don't: they didn't engage.
***************
Formal logic subject:
The definition of a reason
The selections on formal logic that follow are also taken for the most part, from the
Key to the Logic Machine.

DANG PO LA, RTAGS SU BKOD PA, RTAGS KYI MTSAN NYID, DE SGRUB KYI RTAGS SU BKOD PA, DE SGRUB KYI RTAGS KYI MTSAN NYID,
Here is the first part of our discussion. The definition of a reason is "Anything
put forth as a reason." The definition of a reason in any particular logical
statement is, "Anything put forth as the reason in any particular logical
statement."

YOD MED GANG RUNG YIN NA, DE SGRUB KYI RTAGS YIN PAS KHYAB STE, DE YIN NA, DE SGRUB KYI RTAGS SU BKOD PAS KHYAB PA'I PHYIR TE, RI BONG RVA DE, DE CHOS CAN, MI RTAG STE, RI BONG RVA YIN PA'I PHYIR ZHES PA'I RTAGS SU BKOD PA'I PHYIR,
It doesn't even matter if something exists or not, it can always be a reason in
any particular logical statement. This is because of the fact that, no matter
what something may be, it can still always be put forth as the reason in any
particular logical statement. And this is true because even the horns of a rabbit
can be put forth as a reason, in the following way:
Consider anything, whether it exists or not.
It is a changing thing,
Because it is the horns of a rabbit.
***************

The forms of debate:
The motivation for debating,
and how to begin a debate
Monks in a monastery such as Sera Mey Tibetan Monastery in south India
follow a rigorous schedule of debate. At around age twelve, young monks
begin to study formal logic (takrik) and the basic related topics (dura) with their
house teacher. By age fifteen, if their progress is satisfactory, they are allowed
to enter the debate courtyard and participate in the debates.
At Sera Mey, debates are held twice a day on every other day, once in the
morning and once at night. On the remaining days, with the exception of
Tuesday (which is market day), debating is held only at night, so that monks
can attend extra classes with their scripture teachers in the morning.
Debate is an incredibly powerful tool for reviewing and digging deeper into
the subjects learned during classes each day. During a typical day, a monk
will spend the early morning in prayers at the assembly hall, and then go
home to memorize scripture in his room. Later in the morning he attends
either debate or his regular classes. This is followed by a break for lunch, a
rest, and personal study. The afternoon is spent in two or three classes with
five to twenty other students, in the room of a scripture master.
After an evening meal, monks study on their own. Around six o'clock, a gong
called a ka-nga (sky-drum) is beat from atop the main temple of the monastery.
This is the call to the debate courtyard. The beat begins slow, and then speeds
up to a quick pulse. By the time it reaches its crescendo, all monks are
expected to be ready in the courtyard, sitting in rows around the platform and
throne (called a shuktri) where the great debates are centered.
No books are allowed in the debate courtyard; the feeling as you sit in your
room and hear the gong beaten is that you will be completely naked, and
armed only with your own knowledge. You straighten your robes, grab your
monk's shawl and your rosary, and slip a small Tibetan rug under your arm.
This carpet will keep your bottom warm through the many hours ahead,
exposed to the night, sitting on the flagstones of the courtyard. Until recently,
the debate courtyards in south India had no electricity; it still fails frequently,
and some of the most pleasant hours of a monk's day are spent out on the
courtyard, under the stars, in the sound of the debates and a soft wind blowing
past.
The debate master, known as the giku, supervises the debates, walking around
the courtyard answering questions, urging the debaters on, and enforcing
discipline with an occasional hearty swing of his rosary. He is normally a

senior geshe, and serves as vice-abbot of the entire monastery, representing the
abbot whenever he is unable to attend a function.
A senior student in the debate courtyard, one with a good voice and memory,
begins to recite the kurim (sku-rim), or opening prayers. No debate session is
begun without at least a brief version of the opening prayers. This is a time
for every monk to sit quietly, chanting and reviewing his motivation for the
debates. It is considered extremely important to think carefully during these
prayers, and to remove any emotions of competitiveness or pride for the
coming debates. We debate so that we can help the others around us, and to
examine what we believe, so that we can become enlightened more quickly,
and therefore be of ultimate help to all living beings.
After the kurim is completed, the monks break out in a kind of victory cheer
using the sound dhi!--the root syllable of Gentle Voice, the embodiment of the
Buddha's intellect and wisdom--to celebrate the beginning of another debate
session. Each monk then stands up and mills around the debate courtyard,
looking for another monk with whom to debate one-on-one. This is an
opportunity for monks from different classes (like freshmen and sophomores
in high school) to challenge each other.
Since each class is debating a completely different subject, this is an excellent
time for the older monks to review what they have already learned, by
choosing a partner from one of the lower classes. The younger monk, in turn,
has a chance either to go through his class's current topic with a more
experienced debater, or to hear a little bit about a topic which he will have to
debate in the coming years.
The two monks decide on who will be the attacker, and who the defender.
The defender throws his carpet down on the flagstones, often near a wall
where he can lean, and seats himself. The attacker stands facing his opponent,
thinking furiously of a subject from which to begin. He then unfolds part of
his monk's shawl and drapes it over his left shoulder from the back, a sign of
respect that has been followed since the time of Lord Buddha.
The attacker bows close to his opponent's face and claps his hands,
simultaneously whispering, Dhi jitar chuchen!--which means: "Dhi! So what
do you think about this one?" He begins the debate then normally by making
a statement which is false, to see if his opponent can disprove him. A typical
statement of this kind might be, "There is no logical reason why Lord Buddha
repeated himself in the Heart Sutra, where he says 'Well done! Well done!"
This naturally becomes the starting point of a heated argument, which might
last for hours.
The attacker in the debate will accompany his salvos with vigorous body
language like stamping and clapping, as well as shouts and taunts. None of

this is meant in a competitive or insulting way, but only as a way of breaking
the concentration of the opponent. Monks trained in the debate courtyard
thereby learn to concentrate deeply, and to stay free of distraction even with
hundreds of screaming debaters all around them. This will be a great asset to
them when they must sit in their rooms and think out difficult texts, or as they
answer future students in different parts of the world, as they present their
objections or difficult questions on specific points in the Buddha's teachings.
After about an hour or so, the debate master walks through the midst of the
debaters, waving the end of his monk's shawl. This is a sign for the various
classes to group together for the second stage of the debates; all the monks
studying Middle-Way philosophy, for example, move quickly (for fear of the
debate master's rosary) to sit together in a particular corner of the debate
ground.
Here the monks of each class sit in two groups facing each other, with a
narrow corridor left between the two groups. The groups themselves form into
rows, perhaps three or four deep in a larger class, so that every monk can
watch the debate. Each class has a class leader, known as a kyorpon (or
"recitation leader"), who is chosen in the first year that the class is formed, and
who will serve in his position until the members of the class take their geshe
examinations some 18 years later.
Each member of the class throws his rosary into a pile on the flagstones in the
open space between the two groups of monks. The class leader picks all the
rosaries up in his hands, and tosses the whole bunch into the air. He closes
his eyes and grabs one of the rosaries as the bunch falls to the ground. The
owner of this rosary will be the defender in the first debate of the session.
This process is repeated for the attacker, and usually for an "assistant"
defender. Monks who enjoy debate bring huge, long rosaries to the courtyard,
and the lazy ones buy a tiny one.
The two defenders seat themselves on their mats at the head of the corridor
between the two groups of monks, and the attacker comes and stands within
the corridor. He begins a debate as before. After a few minutes, any monk
who has a good idea to bring up might start to yell it at the defenders as well,
and will often stand up and push his way past the original attacker. Within
about a half an hour, a whole group of attackers may be pushing and shoving
to get to the front and scream their question at the defenders. This part can
be very physical, but it is extremely rare to see anyone in the debate courtyard
actually lose their temper.
The tempo of a debate is very fast, with heavy philosophical concepts flying
by in a clipped mixture of modern slang and ancient literary Tibetan. The
audience has to listen carefully to follow where the debaters are running. It
takes only a few minutes to tear through a difficult concept in a way so

thorough that it could never be accomplished even in hours of classroom time
or reading in one's room. There is probably no more powerful tool for
learning the great ideas of Buddhism.
Selecting a topic, and maintaining a good motivation, are the two keys in
getting the most out of the wonderful opportunity of a debate. An experienced
debater, like any good Buddhist, learns to bring up the difficult points that he
or she is unsure of--it is less comfortable than debating what you already
understand clearly, but within a few minutes you will have deep insights into
your question that you could never come up with on your own. Most
nighttime debates last for four or five hours, and it is not unusual for a class
to get engrossed and go on for most of the night. The level of understanding
which monks reach this way is extraordinary.
It is important to give up any feeling of being self-conscious or embarrassed
about debating. Say what you think, and say it with power! If you're wrong,
you'll learn something new, and you can only be the better for it. Remember
that your whole motivation is to become enlightened as quickly as you can,
and be able to lead others to the paradise of enlightenment too. For this you
will have to know your stuff well--you will have to know what you believe,
and know why you believe it, and be able to express it clearly and defend it,
especially in a country where Buddhism is just beginning.
It is essential for American Buddhists to believe in the Dharma only when it
makes perfect sense to them, and not because of blind faith or tradition. Only
then will the Dharma take strong root in this country, and only then will
millions be able to follow it, and reach the goal of deathless bliss. You will
have no trouble debating if you remember this--you are debating to save the
lives of others.

***************
Formal logic subject:
The subject, the quality to be proven,
and the quality denied in a logical statement

SGRA CHOS CAN, MI RTAG STE, BYAS PA'I PHYIR, ZHES BKOD PA'I TSE, SGRA SBYOR BA DE SGRUB KYI RTZOD GZHI, MI RTAG PA DE SGRUB KYI BSGRUB BYA'I CHOS, SGRA MI RTAG PA BSGRUB BYA, BYAS PA RTAGS YANG DAG, RTAG PA DGAG BYA'I CHOS, SGRA RTAG PA SBYOR BA DE SGRUB KYI DGAG BYAR 'JOG, DES GZHAN LA YANG RIGS 'GRE,
Let's consider now a case where we put forth the following logical statement:
Consider sounds.
They are changing things,
Because they are something which is made.
The basis of contention in this statement [--that is, the subject of the proof--]
is "sounds." The quality to be proven is being a changing thing. The assertion,
the idea to be proven, is that sounds are changing things. The reason is being
something which is made. The quality being denied is being an unchanging
thing. The idea being denied is that sounds are unchanging. You can apply
this same pattern to every other logical statement.
***************
The forms of debate:
Posture, the use of a rosary,
and formulating the statement of a reason in three parts
In our second lesson we will cover the classical posture for debating, how to
use a rosary during a debate, and how to formulate a classical logical statement
during a debate.
The person defending in a debate sits down and faces the challenger, who
stands. The defender normally maintains a fairly mild appearance (until the
debate gets hot), gesturing slightly with his hands, and answering quickly and
concisely to points raised by the challenger.
The challenger, on the other hand, uses extensive body language to throw his
opponent off. After the initial challenge, he stands sideways to his opponent,
with his left foot forward. Each new assertion is accompanied by a stamp of
the left foot, and a clap of the right hand on top of the left, where the rosary
is strung around the arm. From time to time, the rosary is stretched back with
the right hand as if aiming an arrow from a bow. This is an ancient debating
custom, and in pictures of Master Dignaga or Master Dharmakirti we can still
see the same gesture.
The rosary, as noted earlier, is also used in the selection of the initial challenger
and defender. It is also an important tool for counting out lists of things,
which are so popular in Buddhism: the two realities, the three Jewels, the four
arya truths, the five paths, the six realms. . .and so on. During the course of
a debate, the challenger and defender will often count out a list together on

their rosaries, to make sure both are in synch on the point. Very occasionally
a debater will swing a rosary to make a point, although it is rare and
unaccepted to actually strike the other party--it would be more common to
strike your own thigh or palm to get a nice "thwock"!
Positioning in front of the opponent says a lot. When an opponent makes a
very serious mistake or uses circular reasoning, you might swirl around in a
spin and come down with a clap. If an opponent takes too long to answer a
question or remember a quotation, you might turn your back and walk away
a few strides, to feign disgust with his lack of preparation. Sometimes you
might make rhetorical comments to the audience on both sides--"Where did
he get that statement from? Sounds like a quotation from an autocommentary
to a root text that was never written!"--and throw out your arms with your
palms up, like "Who could ever debate with such a dummy!"
Sometimes you would get a bunch of your classmates up beside you to scream
the same syllogism a few times in unison, with exactly the same claps and
stamps: it looks like a chorus line or cheerleaders yelling Buddhist logic.
Again, the whole point is that everyone learn to think quickly and clearly
under pressure, which will help us all spread the teachings. The debates in
Tibetan monasteries are refreshingly free of any of the American competitive
attitude, and everybody is just excited about learning. In 15 years of debating
in Tibetan monasteries, the American monk writing this account has never
once been treated with any trace of disrespect or prejudice.
The classical presentation of a proposition in debate, after the initial challenge,
has three parts, following the rules of formal logic established even a early as
Lord Buddha himself. We first choose a subject, the thing we are going to
debate about. One example would be "human beings." Then we choose a
quality about them that we wish to prove to our opponent; for example, that
they "have to die." Finally we choose a reason--which in Buddhist logic more
often refers to the main thing mentioned in the reason as it is expressed--such
as "being born." The entire proposition presented to the opponent then will
look like this:

MI CHOS CAN,
Consider human beings.

SHI RGYU YIN TE,
They do have to die,

SKYES PA'I PHYIR,
Because they are born.
The defender listens to this proposition carefully, and then quickly prepares his
answer in his mind. The very specific rules for answering will be covered in
the reading for the next class.

Quality and Characteristic

`, DRUG PA SPYI DANG BYE BRAG GI RNAM BZHAG BSHAD PA LA, DGAG BZHAG SPONG GSUM LAS, DANG PO LA,
Here is the sixth section: a presentation of quality and characteristic. For this
presentation we will first refute the position of our opponents, then present our
own position, and then finally eliminate their rebuttal.

KHA CIG NA RE, SPYI YIN NA BYE BRAG MA YIN PAS KHYAB ZER NA,
Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
Nothing which is a general category (in the sense of being a
quality) can ever be a specific member of a category (in the sense
of being characteristic of a quality).

DNGOS PO CHOS CAN, BYE BRAG MA YIN PAR THAL, SPYI YIN PA'I PHYIR, KHYAB PA KHAS,

Consider a water pitcher.
It is so characteristic of "working thing,"
Because (1) it is a working thing; (2) it shares a relationship with "working

there exist multiple other objects which are both not it, but still a

It is so true, that it shares a relationship with "working thing" such that to be

Because (1) to be it is to automatically be a working thing; (2) it is something

it could not never exist either.

Because to be a water pitcher is by nature to be a working thing.

Suppose you say that the third part of the reason we gave is not correct.

It is so the case, that if there were no working things it could not never exist
either,
Because if there were no working things, then you could make up anything at
all.

Consider "working thing."
It is so characteristic of "knowable things,"
Because (1) a working thing is a knowable thing; (2) it shares a relationship
with "knowable things" such that to be it is to automatically be a
knowable thing; and (3) there exist multiple objects which are both not
a working thing, but still knowable thing.

It is so one thing which is both (1) a quality of a quality of which something

correct to say that "unchanging thing" is characteristic of the quality of
"characteristic"].
Consider "unchanging thing."
It is so characteristic of the quality of "characteristic,"
Because (1) it is characteristic of a quality; (2) it has a relationship with

It is so [correct to say that there exists nothing which is both a quality of which

Because there exists neither an unchanging version nor a changing version [of

The first point in the reason is so [--that is, it is correct to say that there exists
no unchanging version of something which both a quality of which
"changing thing" is characteristic and which is also characteristic of the
quality "changing thing"],
Because something which is an unchanging thing can never be characteristic
of the quality "working thing";
Which is to say, if something is unchanging, it can never be a working thing.

Because if there existed a changing thing that could be a quality of which

Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim regarding our

of which "working thing" is characteristic:
Consider the fact that sound is a changing thing.

But you cannot agree to the original statement,
Because the fact that sound is a changing thing is a quality of which "working

Because working things are characteristic of the fact that sound is a changing

[It's not correct to say that working things are characteristic of the fact

It is so [correct to say that working things are characteristic of the fact that
sound is a changing thing],
Because (1) working things are "sound is a changing thing"; (2) working things
are related to "sound is a changing thing" in such a way that to be a
working thing is to automatically be "sound is a changing thing"; and
(3) there exist multiple other things which are both not a working thing

[The final part of your reason is not correct; that is, it is not correct to

The final part of our reason is so true; [that is, it is correct to say that there
exist multiple other things which are both not a working thing and yet
are still "sound is a changing thing"],
Because "existing things" are one, and "unchanging things" are one as well.

It is so [correct, to say that "existing things" and "unchanging things" are things
which are both not a working thing and yet are still "sound is a

Because anything which has no self-nature is always "sound is a changing

Consider the two of valid perception and reflection that act as a cause for a

Because they are [characteristic of the quality "mental object"].

Suppose you say that it's incorrect [to say that the two of valid perception and
reflection that act as a cause for a working thing are characteristic of the
quality "mental object"].
They are so [characteristic of the quality "mental object"],
Because (1) the two of them are mental objects; (2) they share a relationship
with "mental object" such that to be the two of them is to automatically
be the mental object; and (3) there exist multiple things which are not
the two of them but are still mental objects.

that the third is not correct; [which is to say, there do not exist multiple
things which are both not the two of valid perception and reflection, but
which are still mental objects].
It is so true, that there exist multiple things which are both [not the two of
valid perception and reflection, but which are still mental objects],
Because omniscience is just such a thing, and valid perception is just such a
thing--the two do exist as separate things.

Because they cannot share a relationship with "working thing" such that to be

A classical example of a "general thing as far as objects" (or "actual mental

The forms of debate:
The Two Responses to a Statement of a Reason
The great beauty of debate is that, assuming both parties stick to the rules of
logic, we must arrive at truth. If the attacker in any particular exchange poses
a series of questions in a correct, logical order, all the defender must do is give
very simple answer reflecting his own beliefs--answers like "yes," or "no"--and
sooner or later the truth will out. This is much like the way in which a
computer program works, with switches at each logical decision point, turned
"on" or "off" to indicate "yes" or "no"--and then continue on to this branch, and
answer "yes" or "no," until the flowchart takes you where you must eventually
go.
In an actual debate, the attacker will give his assertion in three parts: the
statement of the subject, the quality to be proven about the subject, and the

reason why this quality must be one that the subject possesses. He or she
might say, for example,
Consider sounds.
They are changing things,
Because they are something hot to touch.

SGRA CHOS CAN,
MI RTAG STE,
TSA BA'I REG BYA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Here "sounds" are the subject, "being a changing thing" is the quality we are
trying to prove about them, and "because they are things that are something
hot to touch" is the full statement of the reason we give to prove that this
quality does apply to the subject in question.
This is the most common form of logical statement in a Buddhist debate, and
in Tibetan ends with the word chir, which is the word for "because." (In
Tibetan sentence order, the "because" comes at the end.) A defender who hears
a statement ending in chir immediately begins to think of two possible answers.
The first answer is tak ma drup (rtags ma grub), which basically means, "the
reason you gave doesn't apply to the subject." In our case above this is to say,
"It's incorrect to say that sounds are something hot to touch."
Suppose that the attacker had instead made the following statement:
Consider sounds.
They are changing things,
Because they exist.

SGRA CHOS CAN,
MI RTAG STE,
YOD PA'I PHYIR,
Here it would be incorrect to answer tak ma drup, or "the reason you gave
doesn't apply to the subject," because it is true that "existing" applies to

"sounds"--that is, sounds do exist. Instead, the defender would answer kyappa
ma jung (khyab pa ma byung), or "it doesn't necessarily follow." This is the same
as saying, "I admit it's true that sounds exist, but it doesn't necessarily follow
then that they have to be changing things." After all, there are things--like
emptiness or empty space--which exist but are not changing things.
Both of these answers are equivalent to saying "no," but for different reasons.
They are the two classic answers because, if we assume a debate is about to
take place, the attacker should begin with something to argue
about--something the defender does not accept.
There are times in a debate though where an attacker is attempting to establish
a certain context--trying to get the defender to accept one thing in order to go
on to something else that he or she does not accept. An example would be the
following:
Consider sounds.
They are changing things,
Because they are things that are made.

SGRA CHOS CAN,
MI RTAG PA YIN TE,
BYAS PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
This is a correct statement, and so the defender answers "yes" or "right." The
way to give such an answer in the Tibetan language is to simply repeat the
verb that the opponent has used in his or her statement. With this last
statement, for example, the defender would simply say, Yin!--or "They are!"
meaning, "Yes! They are things that are made!"
The last thing to know about these answers is: Think carefully before you choose
which one to say! It's quite acceptable in a debate to mull over your opening
response carefully, since this already decides which side of the truth you will
end up at, when both you and your opponent reach the inevitable conclusion
of the flowchart.

Formal logic subject:
The definition of a correct logical statement,
and the three relationships

Here secondly we will explain the definition of a correct reason.
A correct reason is defined as:
A reason where the three relationships hold.
What are the three relationships? They are the following three: the relationship
between the subject and the reason; the positive necessity between the reason
and the quality to be proven; and the reverse necessity between the reason and
the quality to be proven. Here now we will give the definition, classical
examples, and supporting arguments for each.

Here is the first. The "relationship between the subject and the reason" in any
particular proof is defined as holding when:
The reason is ascertained through valid perception to be
something that only applies to the subject of the proof--the object
about which the opponent entertains his doubt--in the way
asserted.

DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS KHO NA LA 'GOD TSUL DANG MTHUN PAR YOD PA NYID DU TSAD MAS NGES PA DE, DE SGRUB KYI RJES KHYAB KYI MTSAN NYID,
The "positive necessity between the reason and the quality to be proven" in any
particular proof is defined as holding when:

The reason is ascertained through valid perception to be
something that only applies to the group of similar cases for the
proof, in the way asserted.

The "reverse necessity between the reason and the quality to be proven" in any
particular proof is defined as holding when:
The reason is ascertained through valid perception to be
something that only fails to apply to the group of dissimilar cases
for the proof, in the way asserted, due to its relationship to the
general type represented by the explicit form of the quality to be
proven.

These definitions, however, are only meant to convey the principal sense of
what each relationship is; something can, however, satisfy one of them and still
not be a correct reason. Sound, for example, satisfies all three of these
definitions in a proof that sound is a changing thing, but is none of the things
defined by any of the three.

Suppose we now relate these in more detail, to specific applications. The
holding of the "relationship between the subject and the reason in a proof
where sound is proven to be a changing thing" can be defined as:

The reason is such that--
(1) "Sound" provides the subject about which the
opponent entertains doubt, in a proof where the
particular thing is being used as a reason in the
proof that sound is a changing thing; and
(2) This particular thing is also ascertained by a valid
perception only to apply to sound, in the way
asserted--while it is also the case that it and sound
are separate from each other.

The holding of the "positive necessity between the reason and the quality to be
proven in a proof where sound is proven to be a changing thing" can be
defined as:
The reason is such that--
(1) There does exist a correct "similar example,"
incorporating both the reason and the quality to be
proven;
(2) The reason is related to "changing thing"; and
(3) The reason is ascertained through valid perception to
be something that only applies to the group of
similar cases in the way asserted, in a proof where
sound is proven to be an unchanging thing.

The holding of the "negative necessity between the reason and the quality to
be proven in a proof where sound is proven to be a changing thing" can be
defined as:
The reason is such that--
(1) There does exist a correct "dissimilar example,"
involving both the reason and the quality to be
proven;
(2) The reason is related to "changing thing"; and
(3) The reason is ascertained through valid perception to
be something that only fails to apply to the group
of dissimilar cases in the way asserted, in a proof
where sound is proven to be an unchanging thing.

MTSAN GZHI NI, BYAS PA DE BYAS PA'I RTAGS KYIS SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I PHYOGS CHOS, RJES KHYAB, LDOG KHYAB GSUM KA YIN,
Here is the classical example. "Something which is made" is an example
where, in a proof where "something which is made" is being used as the reason
to prove that sound is something changing, all three hold: the relationship
between the subject and the reason; the positive necessity between the reason
and the quality to be proven; and the negative necessity between the reason
and the quality to be proven.

Selection from the collected topics:
Subjects and Objects
The study of subject states of mind, and of the wide variety of objects actually involved
in a perception involving these states of mind, is one of the most important and
intriguing subjects in the study of the Buddhist logic schools. This particular topic
is covered most thoroughly in a monastic textbook from Drepung Tibetan Monastery
popularly known as The Collected Topics of the Spiritual Son (Sras bsdus-grva),
by Master Ngawang Trashi--the spiritual son of the great Jamyang Shepa (1648-
1721).

Here secondly is the presentation of our own position.
There does exist a definition of an object, because it is the following:
Anything which is apprehended by a valid perception.

YUL DANG YOD PA DANG GZHAL BYA RNAMS DON GCIG, YUL LA DBYE NA GNYIS YOD DE, DNGOS PO DANG RTAG PA GNYIS YOD PA'I PHYIR,
"Objects" and "existing objects" and "objects apprehended by the mind" are all
synonamous. Objects can be divided into two types: the two of working things
and unchanging things.

DNGOS PO LA DBYE NA LNGA YOD DE, GZUGS KYI PHUNG PO DANG , TSOR BA'I PHUNG PO DANG , 'DU SHES KYI PHUNG PO DANG , 'DU BYED KYI PHUNG PO DANG , RNAM PAR SHES PA'I PHUNG PO DANG LNGA YOD PA'I PHYIR,
Working things can be divided into five different kinds: (1) the heap of
physical matter, (2) the heap of feeling, (3) the heap of discrimination, (4) the
heap of other factors, and (5) the heap of consciousness.

GZUGS KYI PHUNG PO'I MTSAN NYID YOD DE, RANG GI CHA SHAS DU MA 'DUS PA'I GZUGS RUNG DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There does exist a definition of the heap of physical matter, because it is:
That thing which can be pointed to as being physical matter, and
which incorporates its many different parts.

GZUGS KYI PHUNG PO DANG GZUGS GNYIS DON GCIG, GZUGS KYI PHUNG PO LA DBYE NA GNYIS YOD DE, PHYI'I GZUGS DANG NANG GI GZUGS GNYIS YOD PA'I PHYIR,
The two expressions "heap of physical matter" and "physical matter" both refer
to the same thing. The heap of physical matter can be divided into two
groups: outer physical matter and inner physical matter.

PHYI'I GZUGS LA DBYE NA, GZUGS KYI SKYE MCHED NAS REG BYA'I SKYE MCHED KYI BAR LNGA DANG , NANG GI GZUGS LA DBYE NA MIG GI DBANG PO NAS LUS KYI DBANG PO'I BAR LNGA YOD PA'I PHYIR,
Outer physical matter can be divided into five types, ranging from the gateway
of form up to the gateway of tangible objects. Inner physical matter can also
be divided into five, ranging from the sense power of the eye up to the sense
power of the body.

TSOR BA'I PHUNG PO'I MTSAN NYID YOD DE, RANG GI CHA DU MA 'DUS PA GANG ZHIG, RANG YUL RANG STOBS KYIS MYONG BA'I SEMS BYUNG MYONG BA DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There does exist a definition of the heap of feeling, because it is the following:
Something which incorporates its many parts, and which is the
mental function of experience, which of its own accord
experiences its particular object.

TSOR BA'I PHUNG PO DANG TSOR BA GNYIS DON GCIG, TSOR BA'I PHUNG PO LA DBYE NA DRUG YOD DE, MIG GI 'DUS TE REG PA'I RKYEN GYIS TSOR BA DANG , RNA BA'I 'DUS TE REG PA'I RKYEN GYIS TSOR BA DANG , SNA'I 'DUS TE REG PA'I RKYEN GYIS TSOR BA DANG , LCE'I

The two terms "heap of feeling" and "feeling" both refer to the same thing. The
heap of feeling can be divided into six different types: feeling which occurs due
to contact involving the eye; feeling which occurs due to contact involving the
ear; feeling which occurs due to contact involving the nose; feeling which
occurs due to contact involving the tongue; feeling which occurs due to contact
involving the body, and feeling which occurs due to contact involving the
mind.

RGYAS PAR DBYE NA, BCO BRGYAD YOD DE, DE DRUG PO RE RE LA DBYE NA BDE SDUG BTANG SNYOMS GSUM GSUM YOD PA'I PHYIR,
Feeling can be divided more finely into eighteen different types, which are
arrived at by dividing each of the six above into three of pleasure, pain, and
neutral feeling.

There does exist a definition of the heap of discrimination, because it is the
following:
That mental function which is established by virtue of its
grasping, of its own accord, to the distinguishing features of its
object; and which incorporates its many parts.

'DU SHES KYI PHUNG PO DANG , 'DU SHES GNYIS DON GCIG, DBYE NA GNYIS YOD DE, MTSAN MAR 'DZIN PA'I 'DU SHES DANG , BKRA BAR 'DZIN PA'I 'DU SHES GNYIS YOD PA'I PHYIR,
The two terms "heap of discrimination" and "discrimination" both refer to the
same thing. Discrimination can be divided into two types: the kind which
grasps to features, and the kind which grasps to symbols.

MTSAN MAR 'DZIN PA'I 'DU SHES BZHAG TU YOD DE, MIG GI 'DUS TE REG PA LAS BYUNG BA'I 'DU SHES DANG , RNA BA'I 'DUS TE REG PA LAS BYUNG BA'I 'DU SHES DANG , SNA'I 'DUS TE REG PA LAS BYUNG BA'I 'DU SHES DANG , LCE'I 'DUS TE REG PA LAS BYUNG BA'I 'DU SHES DANG , LUS KYI 'DUS TE REG PA LAS BYUNG BA'I 'DU SHES TE LNGA PO DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
We can posit different types of discrimination of the kind which grasps to
features, because these would be the following five different kinds:
1) Discrimination which results from contact involving the
eye;
2) Discrimination which results from contact involving the
ear;
3) Discrimination which results from contact involving the
nose;
4) Discrimination which results from contact involving the
tongue; and
5) Discrimination which results from contact involving the
body.

BKRA BAR 'DZIN PA'I 'DU SHES BZHAG TU YOD DE, YID KYI 'DUS TE REG PA LAS BYUNG BA'I 'DU SHES DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
We can also posit a type of discrimination of the kind which grasps to
symbols, because this would be the discrimination that results from contact
involving the mind.

There does exist a definition of the heap of other factors, because it is the
following:

That which (1) consists of those working things which do not
belong to any one or number of the heaps of physical matter,
feeling, discrimination, or consciousness; and which (2)
incorporates its many parts.

'DU BYED KYI PHUNG PO DANG 'DU BYED GNYIS DON GCIG, 'DU BYED LA DBYE NA GNYIS YOD DE, LDAN MIN 'DU BYED DANG MTSUNGS LDAN 'DU BYED GNYIS YOD PA'I PHYIR,
The terms "heap of other factors" and "other factors" both refer to the same
thing. Other factors can be divided into two kinds: those other factors which
are changing things that are neither physical nor mental; and those other
factors which are linked with mind.

LDAN MIN 'DU BYED KYI MTSAN NYID YOD DE, 'DU BYED GANG ZHIG, RANG DANG MTSUNGS LDAN MED PAS RAB TU PHYE BA DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There is a definition of those other factors which are changing things that are
neither physical nor mental:
Those things which (1) are other factors, and which (2) are
differentiated by not having any state of mind which is linked
with them.

MTSAN GZHI NI YOD DE, DNGOS PO DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There is a classical example of this kind of other factor, and that is working
things.

MTSUNGS LDAN 'DU BYED KYI MTSAN NYID YOD DE, 'DU BYED GANG ZHIG, RANG DANG MTSUNGS LDAN YOD PAS RAB TU PHYE BA DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There is a definition of those other factors which are linked with the mind:
Those things which (1) are other factors, and which (2) are
differentiated by having some state of mind which is linked with
them.

SHES GNYIS PO LAS GZHAN PA'I SEMS BYUNG THAMS CAD PO MTSUNGS LDAN 'DU BYED YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Other factors which are linked with mind may be divided into 49 different
mental functions. This is because all mental functions other than the two of
feeling and discrimination are other factors linked with mind.

There is a definition of the heap of consciousness:
(1) A state of mind which is an awareness of something other
than itself, and which has mental functions occurring in
conjunction with it; and which (2) incorporates its many parts.

RNAM PAR SHES PA'I PHUNG PO DANG , RNAM SHES DANG , SEMS DANG , YID RNAMS DON GCIG, RNAM PAR SHES PA'I PHUNG PO LA DBYE NA DRUG YOD DE, MIG GI RNAM PAR SHES PA NAS BZUNG STE, YID KYI RNAM PAR SHES PA'I BAR DRUG YOD PA'I PHYIR,
The expressions "heap of consciousness" and "consciousness" and "mind" and
"awareness" are all synonymous.
The heap of consciousness may be divided into six parts, being the six from
eye consciousness up to consciousness of your awareness.

YUL CAN GYI MTSAN NYID YOD DE, RANG YUL LA 'JUG PA'I CHOS DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,

LDAN MIN 'DU BYED DU GYUR PA'I YUL CAN DANG GSUM YOD PA'I PHYIR,
Subjects may be divided into three different types: states of mind; subjects that
are something physical; and subjects which are something changing which is
neither physical nor mental.

SHES PA'I MTSAN NYID YOD DE, GSAL ZHING RIG PA DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,

That which is invisible and aware.

SHES PA DANG BLO GNYIS DON GCIG, SHES PA LA DBYE NA GNYIS YOD DE, RANG RIG DANG GZHAN RIG GNYIS YOD PA'I PHYIR,
The expressions "perception" and "state of mind" are synonymous. Perception
may be divided into to two parts: the mind's perception of itself
(apperception), and the mind's perception of something other than itself.

RANG RIG GI MTSAN NYID YOD DE, 'DZIN RNAM DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There exists the following definition of apperception:

RANG RIG DANG RANG RIG MNGON SUM GNYI DON GCIG , MTSAN GZHI NI YOD DE, SNGO 'DZIN MIG SHES NYAMS MYONG GI RANG RIG DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
The expressions "apperception" and "direct apperception" are synonymous.
There is a classical example of apperception, and that is the mind's perception
of itself in which you experience your eye consciousness of the color blue.

GZHAN RIG GI SHES PA LA DBYE NA GNYIS YOD DE, SEMS DANG SEMS BYUNG GNYIS YOD PA'I PHYIR,
The mind's perception of things other than itself may be divided into two

The definition of "mind" is the same as what we gave before [as the definition
of perception].
There is a definition of a mental function:
That perception which has a main mind that it exists in
conjunction with.

Mental functions may be divided into 51 different types. These are the
omnipresent five; the five that determine how their object is perceived; the six

Here third is our explanation of correct reasons. Our presentation will be
made in six parts: in divisions based on basic nature; on the quality to be
proven; on how the proof is made; on the statement to be proven; on the
relationship to the group of similar cases; and on the opponent.

Here is the first of these, [the division based on basic nature]. Here there are
three types of correct reasons: those that involve a result, those that involve a
nature, and those used to prove the absence of something.
We will discuss the first of these in four parts: its definition; its divisions; an
explanation of the valid perception used to confirm that the definition applies
properly to a definitive example; and an identification of the various elements,
such as the reason, the quality to be proven, and the subject.

Here is the first. The definition for something which is a correct reason
involving a result for any particular proof is as follows:
It must first be a correct, positive reason for a particular proof.
Secondly, there must exist one thing which is both (1) something
considered the explicit quality to be proven in the proof where
it serves as a reason; and (2) also its cause.
***************
The forms of debate:
The Two Responses to a Statement of Necessity
In Reading Four, we discussed the statement of a necessity--which is most
often expressed as a sarcastic rejoinder to an unacceptable proposition by the
opponent. Remember the example we gave before:
If something is the color of a flower, it must always be a
white color.

ME TOG GI KHA DOG YIN NA, KHA DOG DKAR PO YIN PA'I KHYAB,
Our sarcastic reply was,
Consider the color of a red rose.
So is it then a white color?
Because it is the color of a flower.

RGYAL SRAS ME TOG DMAR PO'I KHA DOG CHOS CAN,
KHA DOG DKAR PO YIN PAR THAL,
ME TOG GI KHA DOG YIN PA'I PHYIR,
The phrase "so is it?" in Tibetan is tel, whenever this is spoken in a debate that
voice drops in a sarcastic tone (when the voice rises in tel, it means it is so,
meaning that we accept our statement; and so we are not speaking
sarcastically).
When any debater, whether it be ourselves or our opponent, presents the other
person with a sarcastic statement of necessity--one ending in tel where the
voice drops--then we are allowed two possible responses. The first is "I
agree," or du ('dod) in Tibetan. In the case just mentioned, this would amount
to answering "I agree that the color of a red rose is a white color."
The second of the two possible answers is chiy chir (ci'i phyir), meaning "Why
so?" (signifying, essentially, that one does not agree). In this case it would
mean, "Why do you ask whether the color of a red rose is a white color?" or,
more specifically, "Why do you imply that I would think that the color of a red
rose is a white color?"
These two responses to a statement of necessity are always used on the debate
ground but rarely appear in written debates in scripture. In a case like the one
above, the line "Because it is the color of a flower" implies that someone has
answered "Why so?" to the sarcastic statement of necessity, "So is it then a
white color?"
The most common case where we see the answer "I agree" in written debates
is indicated in the expression, "Suppose you agree to our original statement."
These two responses to a statement of necessity, along with the two standard
responses to the statement of a reason covered in Reading Three, constitute
almost the entire repertoire of a debater when presented with a statement from
his or her opponent. The four responses essentially amount to "yes" or
"no"--positive or negative--sending the argument down a new branch of
possible scenarios.
If one debater continues only to follow a logical sequence of statements, while
the other continues only to answer with appropriate plus or negative answers,
then Truth must eventually be arrived at. This is the beauty of Buddhist
debate.

Here secondly is the presentation of our own position. There does exist a
definition of a negative thing, because it is the following:
A thing which must be perceived by the state of mind which
perceives it directly through a process of eliminating, directly,
that which it denies.

DGAG PA DANG , SEL BA DANG , GZHAN SEL DANG , LDOG PA BZHI DON 
The four terms "negative thing," "exclusion," "exclusion of all other," and
"reversal" all refer to the same thing.

Negative things may be divided into two different types: things that are
negative in the sense of not being something, and things that are negative in
the sense of the absence of something.

There does exist a definition for a "negative thing in the sense of not being
something," because it is the following:
A negative thing such that the term which expresses it implies
something else--either a negative in the sense of not being
something, or a positive--incidental to denying what it denies.

MTSAN GZHI NI YOD DE, SGRA MI RTAG PA DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There does exist a classic example of a negative thing in the sense of not being

There does exist a definition for a negative thing in the sense of being an
absence of something, for it is the following:
A negative thing such that the term which expresses it does not
imply something else--either a negative in the sense of not being
something, or a positive--incidental to denying what it denies.

MTSAN GZHI NI YOD DE, GANG ZAG GI BDAG MED DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There does exist a classical example of a negative thing in the sense of being
an absence of something, for it is the fact that no person has any nature of their

Negative things may be divided into five different types:
1) Those which are such that the term which expresses them directly
implies something else--either a negative in the sense of not
being something, or a positive--incidental to denying what it
denies directly in the actual wording;
2) Those where the term which expresses them does this implying
indirectly;
3) Those where the term which expresses them does this implying both
directly and indirectly;
4) Those where the term which expresses them does this implying by
context;
5) Those which are such that the term which expresses them implies
nothing else--neither a negative in the sense of not being
something, nor a positive--incidental to denying what it denies
directly in the actual wording.

There does exist the first type, the kind which are such that the term which
expresses them directly implies something else--either a negative in the sense
of not being something, or a positive--incidental to denying what it denies
directly in the actual wording, because one would be the fact that the fact that
no person has any nature of their own is true of a water pitcher.

Suppose you say that this is not correct.
Consider this same thing.
It is so true that it is the kind of negative thing which is such that the term
which expresses it directly implies something else--either a negative in
the sense of not being something, or a positive--incidental to denying
what it denies directly in the actual wording,
Because (1) the term which expresses it denies what it denies directly in the
actual wording; and (2) it also directly implies something else--either
a negative in the sense of not being something, or a positive.

[The first part of the reason you gave is incorrect: it is not correct to say
that the term which expresses the fact that the fact that no person
has any nature of their own is true of a water pitcher denies
what it denies directly in the actual wording.]
But the first part of our reason is correct,
Because the expression "the fact that the fact that no person has any nature of
their own is true of a water pitcher" denies, in its actual wording, the
possibility that any nature of their own that belonged to some person
could ever be true of a water pitcher.

[The second part of the reason you gave is incorrect: it is not correct to
say that the term which expresses the fact that the fact that no
person has any nature of their own is true of a water pitcher also
directly implies something else--either a negative in the sense of
not being something, or a positive.]
But the second part of our reason is correct,
Because the expression "the fact that the fact that no person has any nature of
their own is true of a water pitcher" (1) directly implies that the fact that
no person has any nature of their own exists, and (2) the fact that the
fact that no person has any nature of their own is true of a water pitcher
is a negative thing in the sense of not being something.

RTAGS DANG PO SLA, GNYIS PA MA GRUB NA, BUM PA GANG ZAG GI BDAG MED CHOS CAN, KHYOD YOD PA MA YIN DGAG YIN PAR THAL, KHYOD GZHI GRUB PA'I PHYIR,
The first part of our reason is easy to accept.
Suppose you say that the second part is not correct.
Consider the fact that no person has any nature of their own.
The fact that it is true of a water pitcher is so a negative thing in the sense of
not being something,
Because it can be established as existing.

There does exist the second type of negative, the kind which are such that the
term which expresses them indirectly implies something else--either a negative
in the sense of not being something, or a positive--incidental to denying what
it denies directly in the actual wording, because one would be the fact that
John Smith, who is chubby, never eats during the day.

[It's not correct to say that the fact that John Smith, who is chubby,
never eats during the day is an example of this kind of negative.]
It is so,
Because (1) the expression "John Smith, who is chubby, never eats during the
day" indirectly implies that he eats at night, incidental to denying
directly what it denies: that he eats during the day; and (2) his eating at
night is a positive thing.

It is so,
Because eating is a positive thing.

There does exist the third type of negative, the kind which are such that the
term which expresses them both directly and indirectly implies something
else--either a negative in the sense of not being something, or a
positive--incidental to denying what it denies directly in the actual wording,
because one would be the fact that there exists a John Smith who is chubby,
who doesn't eat during the day, and who is not thin.

[It's not correct to say that the fact that there exists a John Smith who is

the kind of negative thing such that the term which expresses it
both directly and indirectly implies something else--either a
negative in the sense of not being something, or a
positive--incidental to denying what it denies directly in the
actual wording.]
It is so correct to say just this,
Because (1) the expression "There exists a John Smith who is chubby, who
doesn't eat during the day, and who has a body that is not a thin one,"
indirectly implies that he eats at night--and directly implies that there
is a body which is not thin--incidental to denying directly that he eats
during the day; and (2) the fact that there is a body which is not thin is
a negative in the sense of not being something.

There does exist the fourth type of negative, the kind which is such that the
term which expresses it implies through the context something else--either a
negative in the sense of not being something, or a positive--incidental to
denying what it denies directly in the actual wording, because one would be
where you had determined that a particular person must be either of the royal
caste or the Brahmin caste, but were unsure of which; and then someone says
"They are not a Brahmin." The actual wording here directly denies, in its
actual wording, that they are a Brahmin, and then implies--through the
context--that they are of the royal caste; and this is the process you have to go
through to determine which they are.

There does exist finally that kind of negative where the term which expresses
it implies nothing else--neither a negative in the sense of not being something,
nor a positive--incidental to denying what it denies directly in the actual
wording, because one would be the fact that a certain Brahmin does not drink
alcohol.

not drink alcohol is a kind of negative where the term which
expresses it implies nothing else--neither a negative in the sense
of not being something, nor a positive--incidental to denying
what it denies directly in the actual wording.]
It is so,
Because the expression "The Brahmin does not drink alcohol" implies neither
directly, nor indirectly, nor by context, anything else--neither a negative
in the sense of not being something, nor a positive--incidental to
denying what it denies directly in the actual wording: that is, that the
Brahmin did drink alcohol.

DE DAG MA YIN DGAG DANG MED DGAG GNYIS SU 'DU TSUL YOD DE, DANG PO BZHI PO MA YIN DGAG DANG , PHYI MA MED DGAG TU 'JOG DGOS PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
These five can be grouped into two categories: negatives in the sense of not
being something, and negatives in the sense of the absence of something. This
is because the first four should be considered negatives in the sense of not
being something, and the last should be considered a negative in the sense of
the absence of something.

It is not necessarily the case that, just because something is a negative thing,
the term which expresses it denies what it denies in the actual wording. This
is because this is neither necessarily the case with negatives in the sense of not
being something, nor the case with negatives in the sense of being an absence
of something.

that it is not necessarily the case with negatives in the sense of
not being something that the term which expresses them denies
what it denies in the actual wording.]
But the first part of our reason is correct,
Because--even though the two of unchanging things and knowable things are
negatives in the sense of not being something--they are not such that
the terms which express them [in Tibetan] deny what they deny in the
actual wording.

say that it is not necessarily the case with negatives in the sense
of being an absence of something that the term which expresses
them denies what it denies in the actual wording.]
But the second part of our reason is correct,
Because--even though the two of space and the true nature of things are

negatives in the sense of being an absence of something--they are not such
that the terms which express them deny what they deny in the actual wording.

Formal logic subject:
Logical Statements that Use Natures
The following selection is from the monastic textbook entitled An Explanation of the
Art of Reasoning (rTags-rigs), by the Tutor of His Holiness the Dalai Lama,
Purbuchok Jampa Tsultrim Gyatso (1825-1901).
_______________

,GNYIS PA RANG BZHIN GYI RTAGS YANG DAG BSHAD PA LA, MTSAN NYID, DBYE BA, MTSAN GZHI DANG GSUM,
Here secondly is our explanation of correct reasons of the type that use
natures. We will proceed in three steps: the definition, the divisions, and the
classical examples.

DANG PO NI, RANG BZHIN GYI TSUL GSUM YIN PA, RANG BZHIN GYI RTAGS YANG DAG GI MTSAN NYID, DE SGRUB KYI RANG BZHIN GYI TSUL GSUM YIN PA, DE SGRUB KYI RANG BZHIN GYI RTAGS YANG DAG GI MTSAN NYID,
Here is the first. The definition of a correct reason of the type that uses a
nature is as follows:
A reason where the three relationships hold, and which utilizes
a nature.
The definition of a correct reason of the type that uses a nature in any
particular proof is as follows:
A reason where the three relationships hold, and which utilizes
a nature, in any particular proof.

YANG NA KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI RTAGS YANG DAG GANG ZHIGKHYOD KYI RTAGS KYIS DE SGRUB KYI DNGOS KYI BSGRUB BYA'I CHOS SU BZUNG BYA YIN NA, KHYOD DANG BDAG NYID GCIG YIN DGOS PA'I CHA NAS BZHAG PA DE, KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI RANG BZHIN GYI RTAGS YANG DAG GI MTSAN NYID,
The definition of a correct reason of the type that uses a nature in any
particular proof can also be defined as follows:
A reason which is (1) a correct reason in any particular proof,
and (2) which is established as being this kind of reason [one that
uses a nature] by virtue of the fact that anything considered the
explicit quality to be proven for the particular proof in which it
serves as the reason is necessarily such that to be it [the reason]
is to be the quality.

GNYIS PA DE LA DBYE NA, DE SGRUB KYI KHYAD PAR LTOS PA BA'I RANG BZHIN KYI RTAGS YANG DAG DANG , DE SGRUB KYI KHYAD PAR DAG PA BA'I RANG BZHIN GYI RTAGS YANG DAG GNYIS,
Here is the second step. Correct reasons that utilize a nature can be divided
into two different types: correct reasons that utilize a nature and which are
such that they depend on a certain distinction, [of suggesting the thing that
made it]; and correct reasons that utilize a nature and which are such they are
free of dependency on a certain distinction, [of suggesting the thing that made
it].

DANG PO'I MTSAN NYID NI, DE SGRUB KYI RANG BZHIN GYI RTAGS YANG DAG GANG ZHIGRNG BRJOD PA'I SGRAS RANG GI BYED PA PO 'PHEN PA'I CHA NAS BZHAG PA, DANG PO'I MTSAN NYID,
Here is the definition of the first:
A reason which is (1) a correct reason for any particular proof
which utilizes a nature; and (2) which is established as being this
kind of reason by virtue of the fact that the term which expresses
it suggests the thing that made it.

DE GANG ZHIGRNG BRJOD PA'I SGRAS RANG GI BYED PA PO MI 'PHEN PA'I CHA NAS BZHAG PA,
GNYIS PA'I MTSAN NYID,
The definition of the second is as follows:
A reason which is (1) the same as the first part just given; and (2)
which is established as being this kind of reason by virtue of the
fact that the term which expresses it does not suggest the thing
that made it.

DANG PO LA YANG , RANG GI BYED PA PO DNGOS SU 'PHANGS PA DANG , DE SHUGS LA 'PHANGS PA GNYIS YOD,
The first type may be further divided into two: those which suggest the thing
that made them directly, and those which do so indirectly.

GSUM PA MTSAN GZHI NI, RTZOL BYUNG DANG , SKYES PA, DUNG SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I DANG PO DANG , BYAS PA SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I GNYIS PA, DNGOS PO SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I KHYAD PAR DAG PA BA'I RANG BZHIN GYI RTAGS YANG DAG GO,
Here thirdly are the classical examples. "A thing which is produced by
conscious effort" and "a thing which is brought about" are examples of the first
type of reason, in a proof that the sound of a ritual horn is a changing thing.
"A thing which is made" is an example of the second type of reason, in a proof
that sound is a changing thing. "A working thing" is an example of a correct
reason which utilizes a nature and which is such it is free of dependency on
a certain distinction, [of suggesting the thing that made it].

YANG SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I RANG BZHIN GYI RTAGS YANG DAG LA DBYE NA, DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS LA KHYAB BYED DU 'JUG PA'I DE SGRUB KYI RANG BZHIN GYI RTAGS YANG DAG DANG , DE SGRUB KYI MTHUN PHYOGS LA RNAM GNYIS SU 'JUG PA'I DE SGRUB KYI RANG BZHIN GYI RTAGS YANG DAG GNYIS,
A correct reason which utilizes a nature and which is employed in the proof
that sound is a changing thing can also be divided in a different way. This
division would be into the two of (1) correct reasons which utilize a nature and

which apply to the entire group of similar cases for the proof; and (2) correct
reasons which utilize a nature and which both apply and fail to apply to the
group of similar cases for the proof.

MTSAN GZHI RIM PA LTAR, BYAS PA DANG PO DANG , BYAS PA'I BYE BRAG GNYIS PA YIN,
Respective examples would be the reason "a thing which is made," and the
reason "something characteristic of the quality of being made."

DE GNYIS SGRUB PA NI, , BYAS PA DE DANG PO YIN TE, DE DE SGRUB KYI RANG BZHIN GYI RTAGS YANG DAG GANG ZHIG MI RTAG PA YIN NA, DE YIN PAS KHYAB PA'I PHYIR,
Here is a demonstration for each of these.
"A thing which is made" is the first kind of reason,
Because it is (1) a correct reason for the particular proof which utilizes a
nature; and (2) it is such that, if something is a changing thing, it must
always be it [that is, a thing which is made].

BYAS PA'I BYE BRAG GNYIS PA YIN TE, DE DE SGRUB KYI RANG BZHIN GYI RTAGS YANG DAG GANG ZHIGMI RTAG PA YIN NA, DE YIN PAS MA KHYAB PA'I PHYIR,
"Something characteristic of the quality of being made" is the second kind of
reason,
Because it is (1) a correct reason for the particular proof which utilizes a
nature; and (2) it is such that, if something is a changing thing, it is not
necessarily it [that is, something characteristic of the quality of being
made].
***************
The forms of debate:
Using Scriptural Authority
In Buddhist debate, we can prove a thing in two ways: we can prove it with
logic, and we can prove it with scriptural authority; that is, by quoting a
scripture which is accepted by the opponent. In Tibetan these two are known,
respectively, as rikpa (rigs-pa) and lung (lung)--and the idea is so important that
some monks (such as Khen Rinpoche's devoted attendant) are give the name
"Lungrik." Quoting scripture must obviously be used with care when

attempting to demonstrate something to a person who is not yet a Buddhist,
since they may very well deny the authority you are quoting.
Favorite texts to quote in the monastery are the older scriptures from India:
either the word of Lord Buddha himself, or the word of one of the great early
Indian masters, as found in the Kangyur and Tengyur collections of the great
classics of India translated into Tibetan. These are accepted by all schools of
Tibetan Buddhism. In a debate between monasteries which are all of the
Gelukpa tradition--such as the annual winter debates attended primarily by
monks of the "Great Three" monasteries of Sera, Ganden, and Drepung--the
favorite works to cite would be those of Je Tsongkapa or one of his major
disciples: Gyaltsab Je, Kedrup Je, or His Holiness the First Dalai Lama.
In everyday debates at your own home monastery, you would normally quote
from one of the monastic textbooks that are unique to the curriculum of each
individual monastery; these are known as yikcha (yig-cha). These textbooks
have developed over the last five hundred years much in the same way as the
ACI course notebooks, and similar courses in the West.
The ammunition for using a quotation in the debate ground must of course be
prepared in advance: no one can bring a scrap of paper into the area, and all
quotations must be recited from memory. One way to get a good booing from
the assembled crowd is to start a quotation and then flounder, unable to finish
it from memory!
A scriptural citation is normally used to back up an assertion just given as a
reason in a proof, and it is often introduced with a great flourish, emphasizing
the indisputability and greatness of the source you have selected. You might
see, for example, the following, where we start out with:
Consider sound.

SGRA CHOS CAN,
It is a changing thing,

MI RTAG STE,
Because it is something which is made.

BYAS PA'I PHYIR,
The opponent replies with:

Your reason is wrong!

RTAGS MA GRUB,
Meaning, sound is not a thing which is made. We then reply with,
Consider sound.

SGRA CHOS CAN,
It is so something which is made,

BYAS PA YIN PAR THAL,
Because it was spoken to be that way by the High and Holy One, the
Good and Glorious Kedrup Tenpa Dargye, a Master (Ke) Who
has Found All Attainments (Drup), and Whose Kindness to All
of Us is Infinitely High; and because His words are something
that you must accept!

And he did so speak it be this way, because he did so in his Overview
of the Perfection of Wisdom, with the following words: "When we
use 'something which is made' as a reason to prove that sound
is a changing thing."

Kedrup Tenpa Dargye (1493-1568) is the principal author of the textbook series
of Sera Mey; he is therefore, for the monks of Sera Mey, an indisputable
authority, and his words must be accepted.

A typical strategy once an opponent has resorted to scriptural authority is to
respond that, despite the fact that such a statement was once made by that
authority, it does not necessarily prove what the opponent claims that it does.
In such a case, the other side in the debate just described might come back
with:
"It doesn't necessarily follow!"

KHYAB PA MA BYUNG ,
Whenever someone contradicts scripture, it's time to pull out the unique
response used by monks from Sera Mey. (Other monasteries have their own
slightly different version.) Here you scream the following at the top of your
lungs, and then go on to the formula above:
You contradict the scriptures! You contradict the holy scriptures!

Contradiction and Relationship
The following reading consists of the Presentation of the Concepts of Contradiction
and Relationship ('Gal-'brel gyi rnam-bzhag), from An Explanation of the
Intermediate Path of Reasoning (Rigs-lam 'bring-gi rnam-par bshad-pa), by the
Master Tutor Purbuchok Jampa Tsultrim Gyatso (1825-1901), who in his day held the
position of Tutor to the Dalai Lama.
Please note that indented statements are usually those given by the opponent.
Responses within brackets are those that are usually left unwritten in the Tibetan text,
and are understood to be there because of the context following each.

GNYIS PA RANG LUGS BZHAG PA LA, 'GAL BA LA MTSAN NYID DANG DBYE BA GNYIS,
Here is the second part, where we present our own position. We proceed in
two steps, covering the definition of what it is to be in contradiction, and then
the different types of contradiction.

DANG PO NI, KHYOD THA DAD KYANG YIN, KHYOD YIN PA MI SRID PA YANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN DU DMIGS PA DE, RANG NYID 'GAL BA YIN PA'I MTSAN NYID,
Here is the definition of what it is for two things to be in contradiction:
The two things must (1) be distinct from each other, and then
they must be such that (2) it is impossible for any one thing to be
both of them.

GNYIS PA 'GAL BA LA DBYE NA, PHAN TSUN SPANG 'GAL DANG , LHAN CIG MI GNAS 'GAL GNYIS,
There are two different ways of being in contradiction: contradictory in the
sense of being mutually exclusive; and contradictory in the sense of being
diametrically opposed.

DANG PO NI, RNAM BCAD YONGS GCOD KYI SGO NAS MI MTHUN PAR GNAS PA, PHAN TSUN SPANG 'GAL GYI MTSAN NYID, DE DANG 'GAL BA GNYIS DON 
The definition of the first of these, to be contradictory in the sense of being
mutually exclusive, is as follows:
Two things which conflict with each other in such a way that the
presence of one automatically means the absence of the other.
The two terms "contradictory in the sense of being mutually exclusive" and
"contradictory" refer to the same thing.

GCIGDE LA DBYE NA, DNGOS 'GAL DANG , BRGYUD 'GAL GNYIS, PHAN TSUN DNGOS SU MI MTHUN PAR GNAS PA, DNGOS 'GAL GYI MTSAN NYID, DNGOS SU GNOD BYA GNOD BYED MA YIN ZHING , GZHI MI MTHUN PAR GNAS PA, BRGYUD 'GAL GYI MTSAN NYID,
Things which are contradictory in the sense of being mutually exclusive may
be further divided into two types: those which contradict each other in this
way directly; and those which contradict each other in this way indirectly.

The definition of things which contradict each other in this way directly is
"Two things which conflict with each other directly." The definition of things
which contradict each other in this way indirectly is "Two things which are
such that no one thing can be both, but which are not such that one
immediately obviates the other."

DANG PO'I MTSAN GZHI NI, DNGOS PO DANG DNGOS MED GNYIS LTA BU, GNYIS PA'I MTSAN GZHI NI, TSA GRANG GNYIS DANG , BDAG 'DZIN DANG BDAG MED RTOGS PA'I SHES RAB GNYIS LTA BU,
A typical example of the first would be something like the two of "working
thing" and "a thing which does no work." A typical example of the second
would be "heat" and "coldness," or else "the state of mind which holds that
things have some nature of their own" and "the wisdom which realizes that
nothing has a nature of its own."

GNYIS PA NI, RGYUN BCAD BYA GCOD BYED KYI SGO NAS MI MTHUN PAR GNAS PA, LHAN CIG MI GNAS 'GAL GYI MTSAN NYID,
Here is the definition of the second kind of contradiction--of things which are
contradictory in the sense of being diametrically opposed:
Two things which conflict with each other in such a way that
each one acts to stop the continued existence of the other.

MTSAN GZHI NI, GNYEN PO DANG SPANG BYA GNYIS LTA BU,
A typical example would be a spiritual antidote and the negative personal
quality which it allows you to eliminate.

CHOS DE DANG BDAG GCIG 'BREL GYI MTSAN NYID YOD DE, KHYOD CHOS DE DANG BDAG NYID GCIG PA'I SGO NAS THA DAD, CHOS DE MED NA KHYOD MED DGOS PA'I CHOS DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
The definition of what it is to share a relationship with something else in such
a way that to be the first is to automatically be the other is as follows:

Whenever two existing things are such that, to be the first is by
nature to be the second, but in such a way that they are separate
things; and where--if the second were to cease to exist--then the
first would have to cease to exist as well.

MTSAN GZHI NI, BUM PA DANG BUM PA'I LDOG PA LTA BU,
An example would be the relation between a vase and the exclusion of all that
is not the vase.

GZHI LA SBYAR NA, DNGOS PO DANG BDAG NYID GCIG PA'I SGO NAS THA DAD, DNGOS PO MED NA KHYOD MED DGOS PA DE DNGOS PO DANG BDAG GCIG 'BREL GYI MTSAN NYID, MTSAN GZHI NI, BUM PA LTA BU,
Here is an actual application of the concept. The definition of what it is to
share a relationship with "working things" in such a way that to be a particular
thing is to automatically be a working thing is "something which is such that
to be it is by nature to be a working thing, but in such a way that they are
separate things; and where--if 'working things' were to cease to exist, then the
particular thing would have to cease to exist as well." A typical example here
would be a water pitcher.

DE BYUNG 'BREL GYI MTSAN NYID YOD DE, CHOS DE DANG RDZAS THA DAD PA'I SGO NAS CHOS DE'I 'BRAS BU'I RIGS SU GNAS PA, CHOS DE DANG DE BYUNG 'BREL GYI MTSAN NYID YIN PA'I PHYIR,
The definition of what it is to share a relationship with something else in such
a way that the first has come from the second is as follows:
Whenever two things are such that to be the first is to be the
kind of thing which is the result of the second, in such a way
that to be the first is not to be, by its very essence, the second.

MTSAN GZHI YOD DE, DNGOS PO'I PHYI LOGS SU BYUNG BA RNAMS DNGOS PO DANG DE BYUNG 'BREL YIN PA'I PHYIR,
A typical example would be the relationship of one coming from the other
between those things which are a working thing the moment after it, and the
original working thing.

Formal logic subject:
Logical Statements Used to Prove an Absence of Something,
and the First Category of this Type of Statement
The following selection is from the monastic textbook entitled An Explanation of the
Art of Reasoning (rTags-rigs), also by the Tutor of His Holiness the Dalai Lama,
Purbuchok Jampa Tsultrim Gyatso.

`GSUM PA MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG BSHAD PA LA, MTSAN NYID, DBYE BA, MTSAN GZHI'I STENG DU MTSAN NYID NGES BYED KYI TSAD MA BSHAD PA DANG GSUM,
Here thirdly is our discussion of correct reasons of the type used to prove the
absence of something. We will proceed in three parts: the definition, an
explanation of the divisions, and a description of the valid perception where
we confirm that the definition applies to a typical example.

DANG PO NI, KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI RTAGS YANG DAG GANG ZHIG, KHYOD KYI RTAGS KYIS DE SGRUB KYI DNGOS KYI SGRUB BYA'I CHOS SU BZUNG BYA YANG YIN, DGAG PA YANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN SRID PA DE, KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG GI MTSAN NYID,
Here is the first. The definition of a correct reason used to prove the absence
of something in any particular proof is as follows:
Any reason which is (1) a correct reason for the particular proof;
and (2) such that there can exist one thing which is both (a) the
explicit version of the thing which is considered the quality to be
proven in the particular proof in which it acts as the reason, and
also (b) a negative thing.

GNYIS PA MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG LA DBYE NA, MI SNANG BA MA DMIGS PA'I 
RTAGS YANG DAG DANG , SNANG RUNG MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG GNYIS,
Correct reasons to prove the absence of something can be divided into two
types: correct reasons for the absence of something involving a thing which is
imperceptible [to the particular opponent], and correct reasons for the absence
of something involving a thing which is perceptible [to the particular
opponent].

DANG PO NI, MDO LAS, GANG ZAG GIS GANG ZAG GI TSOD GZUNG BAR MI BYA STE, NYAMS PAR GYUR TE RE, ZHES RANG LA MI SNANG BA TZAM GYIS GZHAN LA YON TAN DE LTA BU MED CES 'CHAD MI RIGS PA'I DON STON PA LA, RNAM 'GREL LAS, TSAD MA RNAMS NI MI 'JUG PA, MED LA MI 'JUG 'BRAS BU CAN, ZHES SOGS KYIS BSTAN,
Here is the first. Now there is a sutra where it says,
No person should ever judge another; those who try will fall.
The point of these words is to show us how wrong it is for us to say that
someone else lacks any particular good quality, only because it does not appear
to us that they do. This same point is made in the Commentary with lines such
as the following:
In a case where valid perception has yet
To engage in the object, the result obtained
Is that they don't: they didn't engage.

The definition of a correct reason used to prove the absence of something
involving a thing which is imperceptible in any particular proof is as follows:
Any reason which is first of all a correct reason used to prove the
absence of something for the particular proof, and which is

secondly such that--even though the thing which is considered
the main element of all which is denied by the proof in which it
serves as the reason does generally exist--this thing is
imperceptible to the valid perceptions of a person for whom this
same reason fulfills its role in the relationship between the subject
and the reason.

DAG,DE SGRUB KYI MI SNANG BA'I 'GAL ZLA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG GNYIS,
This kind of reason can be further divided into two types: a correct reason
used to prove the absence of something in a particular proof, by virtue of the
absence of a corollary which possesses a relationship [with whatever is denied];
and a correct reason used to prove the absence of something in a particular
proof, by virtue of the presence of a corollary which is contradictory [to
whatever is denied].

MTSAN NYID RIM PA LTAR, KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI MI SNANG BA MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG KYANG YIN, MED DGAG KYANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN PA, DANG PO'I MTSAN NYID,
Here are the respective definitions. The first is defined as:
Anything which is first of all a correct reason in a particular
proof for the absence of something involving a thing which is
imperceptible, and which is secondly a negative in the sense of
being the absence of something.

DE SGRUB KYI MI SNANG BA MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG KYANG YIN, MA YIN DGAG DANG SGRUB PA GANG RUNG YANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN PA, GNYIS PA'I MTSAN NYID,
The second is defined as:
Anything which is first of all a correct reason in a particular
proof for the absence of something involving a thing which is
imperceptible, and which is secondly either a negative in the
sense of not being something, or a positive.

DANG PO LA DBYE NA, MI SNANG BA'I RGYU, KHYAB BYED, RANG BZHIN MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS 
YANG DAG GSUM,
The first of these can be divided into three types: those which are correct
reasons used to prove the absence of something which represent (1) a cause for
something involving a thing which is imperceptible; (2) a greater set than
something involving a thing which is imperceptible; and (3) a nature of
something involving a thing which is imperceptible.

Here are respective typical examples for the three. Suppose someone sets forth
the following logical statement:
Consider the place in front of us.
There cannot exist here, in the mental continuum of a
person for whom flesheater spirits [another word
for a preta, or tormented spirit] are still abstruse
objects, a recollection whose object corresponds to
reality, and which is used to ascertain the existence
of a flesheater spirit;
Because there does not exist, in the mental continuum of
this same person, any valid perception wherein he
or she perceives any flesheater spirit.
Think of this fact: that there does not exist, in the mental continuum of this
same person, any valid perception wherein he or she perceives any flesheater
spirit. This represents the first type of reason just listed--for proving the fact
that, in the place in front of us, there cannot exist, in the mental continuum of
a person for whom flesheater spirits are still abstruse objects, a recollection
whose object corresponds to reality, and which is used to ascertain the
existence of a flesheater spirit.

SHA ZA YOD PA LA BSKAL DON DU SONG BA'I GANG ZAG GIS SHA ZA YOD PA TSAD MAS MA DMIGS PA DE, MDUN GYI GZHI 'DIR SHA ZA BSKAL DON DU SONG BA'I GANG ZAG GIS SHA ZA YOD CES DAM BCA' MI RIGS PAR SGRUB PA'I GNYIS PA YIN,
Think now of the fact that a person for whom flesheater spirits are still
abstruse objects has not yet perceived, with a valid perception, the fact that
flesheater spirits exist. This represents the second type of reason just
listed--for proving the fact that, in the place in front of us, it would be
improper for a person for whom flesheater spirits are still abstruse objects to
swear that flesheater spirits do exist.

SHA ZA BSKAL DON DU SONG BA'I GANG ZAG GI RGYUD LA SHA ZA NGES BYED KYI DPYAD SHES DON MTHUN TSAD MAS MA DMIGS PA DE, MDUN GYI GZHI 'DIR DE 'DRA'I GANG ZAG GI RGYUD LA SHA ZA NGES BYED KYI DPYAD SHES DON MTHUN MED PAR SGRUB PA'I GSUM PA YIN,
Think finally of the fact that--in the mental continuum of a person for whom
flesheater spirits are still abstruse objects--there cannot be perceived, with any
valid perception, a recollection whose object corresponds to reality, and which
is used to ascertain the existence of a flesheater spirit. This represents the third
type of reason just listed--for proving the fact that, in the place in front of us,
there does not exist, in the mental continuum of just such a person, any
recollection whose object corresponds to reality, and which is used to ascertain
the existence of a flesheater spirit.

DGOS PA NI, MDUN GYI GZHI 'DIR LHA'I BAR SRID DANG , SHA ZA YOD MED THE TSOM ZA BA'I SGO NAS BSKAL DON DU SONG BA'I GANG ZAG GIS GZHI 'DIR DE GNYIS YOD CES SAM MED CES THAG GCOD DU MI RUNG BA DPER MDZAD NAS, DON LA GANG ZAG GANG DANG GANG GI SKYON YON RANG GI TSAD MAS MA NGES BZHIN DU SGRO BKUR BYAR MI RUNG BAR SHES PA'I CHED DU'O, ,
There is a specific purpose to these kinds of proofs. We are demonstrating
here that, if a person still doubted whether flesheater spirits existed (and if
they were thus still objects which were abstruse for them), then it would be

inappropriate for them to come to some definite conclusion in their own minds
about whether these spirits existed or not. We are meant by this example to
realize how inappropriate it is for us to either overestimate or underestimate
any particular person we may encounter, unable as we still are to
confirm--through a valid perception--whether or not they do in reality possess
a particular positive or negative personal quality.

DE SGRUB KYI DGAG BYA'I CHOS SU BTAGS PA'I DON YIN NA, DE SGRUB KYI DGAG BYA'I CHOS YIN PAS MA KHYAB STE, MDUN GYI GZHI 'DIR SHA ZA BSKAL DON DU SONG BA'I GANG ZAG GI RGYUD LA SHA ZA NGES BYED KYI DPYAD SHES DON MTHUN YOD PA DE DE 'DRA'I DPYAD SHES DON MTHUN MED PAR SGRUB PA'I DGAG BYA'I CHOS SU BTAGS PA'I DON DANG DE'I DGAG BYA'I CHOS GNYIS KA YIN GYI, SHA ZA DANG DE NGES PA'I DPYAD SHES DON MTHUN GNYIS RE RE NAS DE SGRUB KYI DGAG BYA'I CHOS SU BTAGS PA'I DON YIN KYANG DE'I DGAG BYA'I CHOS MA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
It is not necessarily the case, by the way, that if something is what we consider
the main element in all that we deny in a particular logical statement, then it
is also all that we deny in the same statement. Think of the possibility that
there did exist, in the mental continuum of a person for whom flesheater spirits
are still abstruse objects, a recollection whose object corresponds to reality, and
which is used to ascertain the existence of a flesheater spirit. This is both what
we consider the main element in all that we deny, and also all that we deny,
in a proof that there does not exist any such recollection whose object
corresponds to reality. The two of (1) flesheater spirits themselves, and (2)
states of recollection whose objects correspond to reality, and which are used
to ascertain the existence of such spirits, are--each of them separately--a kind
of case where something is what we consider the main element in all that we
deny in the particular logical statement, but not all that we deny in the
particular logical statement.

DANG PO SLA, PHYI MA MA GRUB NA, SHA ZA DANG DE NGES PA'I DPYAD SHES DON MTHUN GNYIS RE RE NAS DE SGRUB KYI DGAG BYA'I CHOS SU BTAGS PA'I DON YIN TE, DE SGRUB KYI PHYI RGOL

The former example is easy. Suppose though that you say that the latter two
are incorrect.
Consider then (1) flesheater spirits themselves, and (2) states of recollection
whose objects correspond to reality, and which are used to ascertain the
existence of such spirits.
These are so--each one of them separately--things that we consider the main
element in all that we deny in the particular logical statement,
Because a correct opponent for this particular proof doubts whether or not
flesheater spirits exist in the place in front of us, and also doubts
whether or not there exists any such kind of recollection whose object
corresponds to reality.

Neither one of these is though, by itself, all that we deny in the particular
logical statement, because generally speaking there do exist flesheater spirits;
and because smoke is not all that we deny in a proof that there exists no
smoke upon the nighttime ocean.

Consider the fact that [the person described here] exists. This is an example
of a correct reason used to prove the absence of something in a particular
proof, by virtue of the presence of a corollary which is contradictory [to
whatever is denied], for proving that a person for whom flesheater spirits are
still abstruse objects still has no recollection which ascertains the existence of
such spirits, and whose object corresponds to reality.

Generally speaking, there are three different ways in which an object can be
abstruse, relative to your state of mind. These are objects which are abstruse
by virtue of the place, time, and nature. The first would be something like the
details of particular beings or realms which are situated at a great distance
from your particular location. The second would be something like the details
of events which have occurred or are going to occur at times which are eons
away in the past or future. These things are not abstruse in their own general
right, but only relative to a given state of mind. The third would be something
which is abstruse by virtue of being very subtle in nature, even though it may
exist in the immediate proximity. Examples of this would be things like a
flesheater spirit, or a being between death and rebirth who is headed towards
birth as a human or pleasure being, and their various heaps.
***************
The forms of debate:
Some Debating Tactics
The exquisite boxing style of Muhammed Ali showed the value of distracting
and harassing your opponet before even throwing a punch, and we use some
of the same tactics in a Buddhist debate. Again remember though, that the
goal is not to defeat your opponent, but to help him and yourself and the
audience listening; to sharpen his ability to concentrate under pressure, and to
raise challenging questions that will clarify everyone's understanding of the
life-saving Dharma.
Almost every normal debate begins with the attacker taking a mistaken
position, and this is perhaps the most important tactic of all. The greatest

geshes and debaters in the monastery have overcome any kind of pride, and
are fearless in taking a position which is mistaken--a position where they will
eventually have to "lose"--if this means that the defender and the audience will
learn some important point. The goal here is to take a position which is almost
correct, and very subtly mistaken: this will make for a fun debate, and clear up
this point for everyone.
Feigning is another common tactic in boxing and debate. Hutzpah is essential:
even if you're not sure your answer is correct, act like it is. Let the other
person prove you wrong logically, and you'll both learn something valuable.
Even if you can't hear the opponent's position clearly (which is a common
occurrence in the incredibly noisy debate grounds!), or you don't have much
clue of what he's talking about, take a shot! It starts a lively debate, which
sooner or later clarifies every detail of the issue. The point is: always work
from what you honestly think, answer to the best of your current
understanding, and don't be afraid to go on a journey with your opponent,
even through some dark or fuzzy places in your understanding, to reach to the
higher ground of knowledge.
Don't be afraid to use the audience to help you distract or disrupt your
opponent. Many an unbeatable position is overthrown in the monastery
simply by the (mistaken) boos of the audience, egged on by the attacker. Here
there are a whole repertoire of distracting taunts, which are fair game in the
rules of debate. We will list a few of them following--please note though that
the exact meaning of the words used has often been obscured over the
centuries; the meanings given here are sometimes "best guesses" offered to us
in an informal interview by the most qualified master in the world, Khen
Rinpoche Geshe Lobsang Tharchin.
One common taunt is Whoa! The attacker either feels or feigns great surprise
at a position taken by the defender, and begins a loud whoa sound. This is
picked up by the monks in the immediate vicinity who are following the
argument, and quickly spreads to the "deadheads" in the back (who are often
engaged in some conversation of their own and not listening) and even to
monks in other debate groups in the compound--all of whom have no idea
what the defender even said that he deserves a whoa! This whoa! generally
means "Uh-oh! Now you're in trouble!"
In the winter debates, the whoa can be followed by a loud chir! This is most
often used when an argument has been presented to a defender and he finds
himself unable to formulate an answer; it has the meaning of "Come on! We
want an answer!" A common corrolary in smaller groups is for the attacker
himself to say to a speechless defender, labda!--"Come on! Say something!"
Some people say that the chir! is che!--meaning "Your argument has stalled
now!" The spellings of these three in Tibetan are:

PHYIR, LAB DA, CHAD,
A screamed ha! has the same meaning as in English, "Wow! What a joke! Are
you kidding?" It is often accompanied by throwing your hands up in the air.
Tsa! is one of the most common taunts; it comes from the word ngo-tsa,
meaning "You should be ashamed to have said such a stupid thing!" and is
typically used when someone is forced to retract a position they have taken
themselves earlier. This is most often accompanied with a slap of the back of
one hand in the palm of another, with everything repeated a few times for
emphasis: Tsa! Ooooh tsa! Tsa chik! ("You should be ashamed! Ashamed, man!
What a disgrace!"). At this point a debater might scowl at his opponent and
jam his finger in his own cheek, meaning: "Time for you to blush, man!" Some
people say the tsa is the tsar in ngo-tsar, meaning, "Man! That was a weird
thing to say!" These words in Tibetan are:

TSA, NGO TSA, NGO MTSAR,
Two more taunts are more based in formal logic than in tactics. The first is
kyappa long, which literally means, "Give me your statement of necessity then!"
This is used in a context like the following, with the indented portion from the
opponent:
Consider sound.
It must so be a changing thing,
Because it's a thing which is made.
And that's true because anything which is made is always a changing thing.
 SGRA CHOS CAN,
MI RTAG PA YIN PAR THAL,
BYAS PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
BYAS NA MI RTAG PA YIN PAS KHYAB PA'I PHYIR,
It's incorrect to say that.

RTAGS MA GRUB,
Give me your statement of necessity then!

KHYAB PA LONGS,
At this point, the opponent would be forced to give the following absurd
statement of necessity:
Just because something is a thing which is made doesn't prove
that it's a changing thing.

BYAS NA MI RTAG PA YIN PAS MA KHYAB,
A final rejoinder is korsum! or kordhi korsum! This means "You have just made
a circular argument," or "Now you have contradicted yourself completely!" A
typical case would be where the opponent accepts that sound is a made thing,
and accepts that if something is made it must be a changing thing, but
stubbornly asserts still that sound is an unchanging thing. In the second
version of this statement, the root syllable for the mantra of Gentle Voice
(Manjushri, or Jampel Yang) is interjected. The Tibetan spellings for these are:

'KHOR GSUM, 'KHOR DHA'I: 'KHOR GSUM,
Defenders have a few tactics of their own, one of the most useful being ah? or
la?--meaning "Whaddya say? I couldn't catch what you said." Then you put
your cupped palm up to your ear as if you're having a problem hearing the
attacker in all the mayhem of the debate ground. This is a great way to buy
a few extra moments while you formulate your answer!

Selection from the collected topics:
Definitions and the Things They Define
The following reading consists of the Presentation of Definitions and the Things
They Define (mTsan-mtson gyi rnam-bzhag), from An Explanation of the
Elementary Path of Reasoning (Rigs-lam chung-gi rnam-par bshad-pa), by the
Master Tutor Purbuchok Jampa Tsultrim Gyatso (1825-1901), who in his day held the
position of Tutor to the Dalai Lama.

GNYIS PA RANG LUGS LA, MTSON BYA'I MTSAN NYID YOD DE, BTAGS YOD CHOS GSUM TSANG BA DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Here secondly is our own position. There is a definition of something defined,
because it is the following:
A case where all three of the nominal qualities are present.

There is a way of enumerating these three "nominal qualities," because the
following is a correct list of the three:
1) Generally speaking, the thing should be something to
be defined;
2) It should apply to some definitive example for it; and
3) It should be something defined only for whatever its
definition is, and not for any other.

MTSAN NYID KYI MTSAN NYID YOD DE, RDZAS YOD CHOS GSUM TSANG BA DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There is a definition of a definition, because it is the following:

There is a way of enumerating these three "material qualities," because the
following is a correct list of the three:
1) Generally speaking, the thing should be a definition;

2) It should apply to some definitive example for it; and
3) It should be a definition for nothing other than the
thing it defines.

DON BYED NUS PA'I MTSON BYA'I MTSAN NYID YOD DE, DON BYED NUS PA'I BTAGS YOD CHOS GSUM TSANG BA DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There does exist a definition of what "that which performs a function" defines,
because it is the following:
That case where all three of the nominal qualities pertaining to
"that which performs a function" are present.

DNGOS PO'I MTSAN NYID KYI MTSAN NYID YOD DE, DNGOS PO'I RDZAS YOD CHOS GSUM TSANG BA DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There does exist a definition of the definition of a working thing, because it is
the following:
That case where all three of the material qualities pertaining to
"working thing" are present.

There does exist a definition for a definitive example where all three of the
nominal qualities for "that which performs a function" are present, because it
is the following:
That case of "that which performs a function" where all three of
the nominal qualities for "that which performs a function" are
present.

DE'I MTSAN GZHI YOD DE, DNGOS PO DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There is a definitive example of such a thing, because a working thing would
be one.

YANG NA MTSON BYA'I MTSAN NYID YOD DE, RNAM PAR BZHAG BYA CHOS GSUM TSANG BA DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There is an alternate definition for something to be defined, because it is the
following:
A case where all three of the qualities for being establishing as
something are present.

RNAM PAR BZHAG BYA'I CHOS GSUM 'DREN TSUL YOD DE, MTSON BYA YIN PA, RANG GI MTSAN NYID LAS GZHAN PA'I MTSON BYA MA YIN PA, MTSAN GZHIR GANG BZUNG BA LA SRID PA STE GSUM PO DE 'DREN RIGS PA'I PHYIR,
There is a way of enumerating these three qualities for being established as
something, because the following is a correct list of the three:
1) The thing should be something to be defined;
2) It should not be something defined for any other
definition than its definition; and
3) It should be possible with whatever we are considering
a definitive example.

MTSAN NYID KYI MTSAN NYID YOD DE, RNAM PAR 'JOG BYED CHOS GSUM TSANG BA DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There is also such a definition for a definition, for it is the following:
A case where all three of the qualities for establishing something
are present.

RNAM PAR 'JOG BYED KYI CHOS GSUM PO DE 'DREN TSUL YOD DE, MTSAN NYID YIN PA, RANG GI MTSON BYA LAS GZHAN PA'I MTSAN NYID MA YIN PA, MTSAN GZHIR GANG BZUNG BA 
LA SRID PA STE GSUM PO DE 'DREN RIGS PA'I PHYIR,
There is a way of enumerating these three qualities for establishing something,
because the following is a correct list of the three:
1) The thing should be a definition;
2) It should not be a definition for any object to be defined
other than the one it defines; and
3) It should be possible with whatever we are considering
a definitive example.

MTSAN GZHI'I MTSAN NYID YOD DE, MTSAN NYID KYI SKABS SU BAB PA'I MTSON BYA MTSON PA'I GZHIR GYUR PA DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
There is also such a definition for a definitive example, because it is the
following:
An example which typifies the object to be defined for the
particular definition in question.

DE YANG GZHI GCIG LA MTSON NA, DON BYED NUS PA'I MTSON BYA'I MTSAN NYID YOD DE, DON BYED NUS PA'I RNAM PAR BZHAG BYA'I CHOS GSUM TSANG BA DE DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
We can illustrate these with a specific case. There is a definition for the object
defined by "that which performs a function," because it is the following:
A case where all three of the qualities for establishing something
through "that which performs a function" are present.

Formal logic subject:
Reasons for the Absence of Something
Which Involve Something Perceptible
The following selection is taken from An Explanation of the Art of Reasoning
(rTags-rigs), also by the great tutor, Purbuchok Jampa Tsultrim Gyatso.

,SNANG RUNG MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG LA MTSAN NYID DBYE BA GNYIS,
There are two parts to our explanation of a correct reason for the absence of
something which involves something perceptible [to the opponent]: the
definition, and the divisions.

Here is the first. The definition of a correct reason for the absence of
something which involves something perceptible is the following:
That thing which is both (1) a correct reason for the absence of
something in a particular proof; and (2) such that the thing which
is considered the main element of all which is denied by the
proof is not an abstruse object to the person for whom this same
reason fulfills its role in the relationship between the subject and
the reason.

DE LA DBYE NA, SNANG RUNG GI 'BREL ZLA MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG DANG , SNANG RUNG GI 'GAL ZLA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG GNYIS,
This type of reason may be divided into two types: a correct reason used to
prove the absence of something perceptible in a particular proof, by virtue of
the absence of a corollary which possesses a relationship [with whatever is
denied]; and a correct reason used to prove the absence of something
perceptible in a particular proof, by virtue of the presence of a corollary which
is contradictory [to whatever is denied].

MTSAN NYID RIM BZHIN, DE SGRUB KYI SNANG RUNG MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG KYANG YIN, MED DGAG KYANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN PA, DANG PO'I MTSAN NYID,
Here are the respective definitions of these two different types. The definition
of the first is:
That thing which is both (1) a correct reason used to prove the
absence of something perceptible in a particular proof and (2) a
negative thing in the sense of being an absence of something.

DE SGRUB KYI SNANG RUNG MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG KYANG YIN, MA YIN DGAG DANG SGRUB PA GANG RUNG YANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN PA, GNYIS PA'I MTSAN NYID,
The definition of the second is:
That thing which is both (1) a correct reason used to prove the
absence of something perceptible in a particular proof and (2)
either a negative thing in the sense of not being something, or a
positive thing.

Selection from the collected topics:
The Concept of Exclusion in Perception
For the next selection, we return to The Collected Topics of the Spiritual Son (Sras
bsdus-grva), by Master Ngawang Trashi, the spiritual son of the great Jamyang
Shepa (1648-1721).

RANG GI LUGS LA, GZHAN SEL DANG DGAG PA GNYIS DON GCIG YIN PAS MTSAN NYID 'JOG MI DGOS,
Here secondly is our own position. Because the terms "exclusion" and
"negative thing" refer to the same thing, there is no need to posit a definition
for exclusion.

DNGOS PO YIN NA KHYOD KYI DON RANG MTSAN GYI GZHAN SEL YOD PAS KHYAB LA, DNGOS POR GYUR PA'I DGAG PA DANG DON RANG MTSAN GYI GZHAN SEL GNYIS DON 
If something is a working thing, then there always exists an exclusion for it
which is the objectification of a specific instance. The terms "negative thing
which is a working thing" and "an exclusion which is the objectification of a
specific instance" both refer to the same thing.

GCIGBDG MED YIN NA KHYOD KYI BLO'I GZHAN SEL YOD PAS KHYAB LA, BLO'I GZHAN SEL DANG RTOG PA'I SNANG YUL GNYIS DON 
There is always a mental kind of exclusion for anything which is such that it
possesses no nature of its own. The terms "mental kind of exclusion" and
"object which appears to a conceptualization" refer to the same thing.

GCIGGZHI GRUB NA KHYOD KYI MED DGAG GI GZHAN SEL YOD PAS KHYAB LA, MED DGAG GI GZHAN SEL DANG MED DGAG GNYIS DON GCIG YIN NO, ,
If a thing can be established as existing, then there is always an exclusion of
it which is a negative thing that involves the absence of something. And the
terms "exclusion which is a negative thing that involves the absence of
something" and "negative thing which involves the absence of something" refer
to the same thing.

Formal logic subject:
Identifying Elements of a Logical Statement,
and Some Different Classifications of Correct Logical Statements
The following selection is taken from An Explanation of the Art of Reasoning
(rTags-rigs), composed by the great tutor of His Holiness the Thirteenth Dalai Lama
named Purbuchok Jampa Tsultrim Gyatso (1825-1901).

RTAGS CHOS DON GSUM NGOS BZUNG BA LA, DAM BCA' BZHAG PA DANG , SGRUB BYED 'GOD PA GNYIS DANG PO NI,
This bring us to the section where we identify the reason, the quality to be
proven, and the subject. We proceed in two steps: presenting our position, and
then putting forth proofs to support our position. Here is the first.

ME MED PA DE, ME MED PA'I RTAGS KYIS MTSAN MO'I RGYA MTSOR DU BA MED PAR SGRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS YIN, ME MED DE DE'I RTAGS KYIS DE SGRUB KYI GTAN TSIG MA YIN,
The expression "because there is no fire" is a logical reason for proving that
there is no smoke on the surface of an ocean in the middle of the night in a
proof where "because there is no fire" serves as the reason in the proof.
"Because there's no fire" is not a logical reason for the same proof where that
same term serves as the reason in the proof.

DU BA MED PA DE, ME MED PA'I RTAGS KYIS DE SGRUB KYI SGRUB BYA'I CHOS DANG , DE SGRUB KYI DNGOS KYI SGRUB BYA'I CHOS SU BZUNG BYA GNYIS KA YIN, DU MED DE DE GNYIS KA MA YIN, DES SHING MED SOGS LA RIGS 'DRE'O, ,
The expression "there is no smoke" is both (1) the quality to be proven in that
same proof, where "because there is no fire" serves as the reason; and (2) that
which is considered the explicit form of the quality to be proven for the same
proof. The expression "it's smokeless" is neither of the two. This same pattern
applies for the expressions such as "there are no trees" and so on.

BUM PA TSAD MAS MA DMIGS PA DE, BUM PA TSAD MAS MA DMIGS PA'I SA PHYOGS SU BUM PA MED PAR SGRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS YIN, BUM PA MED PA DE, BUM PA TSAD MAS MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS KYIS DE SGRUB KYI DNGOS KYI SGRUB BYA'I CHOS DANG , DE SGRUB KYI DNGOS KYI SGRUB BYA'I CHOS SU BZUNG BYA GNYIS KA YIN, DES GZHAN RNAMS LA RIGS 'GRE'O, ,
The expression "because there is no water pitcher perceived to be there by any
valid perception" is a logical reason for proving that there exists no water
pitcher in a particular location where no water pitcher is perceived by any
valid perception to be present. The expression "there exists no water pitcher
there" is both (1) the explicit form of the quality to be proven in the same

proof, where "because there is no water pitcher perceived to be there by any
valid perception" is acting as the reason; and (2) that which is considered the
explicit form of the quality to be proven in the same proof. This pattern
follows for other cases as well.

SHA ZA DE, MDUN GYI GZHI 'DIR SHA ZA BSKAL DON DU SONG BA'I GANG ZAG GI RGYUD LA SHA ZA NGES PA'I DPYAD SHES DON MTHUN MED PAR SGRUB PA'I DGAG BYA'I CHOS SU BTAGS PA'I DON YIN KYANG , DE SGRUB KYI DGAG BYA'I CHOS MA YIN,
A "flesheater spirit" [a preta, or tormented spirit] is a main element in the
quality which is denied in a proof that, in the location before us, there can exist
no recollection whose perception corresponds to reality, and which ascertains
a flesheater spirit, in the mind of a person for whom flesheater spirits are
abstruse objects. This same term though is not the "quality which is denied"
itself.

SHA ZA BSKAL DON DU SONG BA'I GANG ZAG GI RGYUD LA SHA ZA NGES PA'I DPYAD SHES DON MTHUN YOD PA DE, DE SGRUB KYI DGAG BYA'I CHOS DANG , DE SGRUB KYI DGAG BYA'I CHOS SU BTAGS PA'I DON GNYIS KA YIN,
The existence, in the mind of a person for whom flesheater spirits are abstruse
objects, of a recollection whose perception corresponds to reality, and which
ascertains a flesheater spirit, is both (1) the quality which is denied in this
particular proof, and (2) a main element in the quality which is denied in the
same proof.

DU BA DE MTSAN MO'I RGYA MTSOR DU BA MED PAR SGRUB PA'I DGAG BYA'I CHOS SU BTAGS PA'I DON YIN KYANG , DE SGRUB KYI DGAG BYA'I CHOS MA YIN,
The term "smoke" is a main element in the quality which is denied in a proof
that there is no smoke on the surface of the nighttime ocean, but it is not the
quality denied in the same proof.

DER DU BA YOD PA DE, MTSAN MA'I RGYA MTSOR DU BA MED PAR SGRUB PA'I DGAG BYA'I CHOS SU BTAGS PA'I DON DANG , DE SGRUB KYI DGAG BYA'I CHOS GNYIS KA YIN,
The "existence of smoke in that particular place" is both (1) a main element in
the quality which is denied in a proof that there is no smoke on the surface of
the nighttime ocean, and (2) the quality which is denied in the same proof.

RTAG PA DE, SGRA RTAG PA MA YIN PAR SGRUB PA'I DGAG BYA'I CHOS SU BTAGS PA'I DON YIN KYANG , DE SGRUB KYI DGAG BYA'I CHOS MA YIN NO, ,
"An unchanging thing" is a main element in the quality which is denied in a
proof that sound is not an unchanging thing, but it is not the quality which is
denied in the same proof.

`GNYIS PA RTAGS YANG DAG LA BSGRUB BYA'I CHOS KYI SGO NAS DBYE NA, SGRUB RTAGS YANG DAG DANG , DGAG RTAGS YANG DAG GNYIS,
Here next is the second major point from above. Correct reasons may also be
classified according to the quality to be proven. Here there are two types:
correct positive reasons, and correct negative reasons.

Here are their respective definitions. First comes the definition of a correct
positive reason for any particular proof:
Something which is (1) a correct reason for a particular proof;
and (2) which is such that there can exist one thing which is both
(a) the object which is considered the explicit form of the quality
to be proven in the proof where it acts as the reason, and (b) a
positive thing.

DE LA DBYE NA, 'BRAS RTAGS YANG DAG DANG , RANG BZHIN GYI RTAGS YANG DAG GNYIS YOD, DE GNYIS GANG RUNG YIN NA, SGRUB RTAGS YANG DAG YIN PAS KHYAB,
These kinds of reasons may be divided into two types of their own: correct
reasons that involve a result, and correct reasons that involve a nature.
Anything which is one of these two types of reasons is always a positive
reason.

KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI RTAGS YANG DAG GANG ZHIG, KHYOD KYI RTAGS KYIS DE SGRUB KYI DNGOS KYI BSGRUB BYA'I CHOS SU BZUNG BYA YANG YIN DGAG PA YANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN SRID PA, KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI DGAG RTAGS YANG DAG YIN PA'I MTSAN NYID,
The definition of a correct negative reason for any particular proof is as
follows:
Something which is (1) a correct reason for a particular proof;
and (2) which is such that there can exist one thing which is both
(a) the object which is considered the explicit form of the quality
to be proven in the proof where it acts as the reason, and (b) a
negative thing.

DGAG RTAGS YANG DAG DANG , MA DMIGS PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG GNYIS DON 
The terms "correct negative reason" and "correct reason for proving the absence
of something" both refer to the same thing.

GCIG`DRUG PA RTAGS YANG DAG LA RGOL BA'I SGO NAS DBYE NA, RANG DON SKABS KYI RTAGS YANG DAG DANG , GZHAN DON SKABS KYI RTAGS YANG DAG GNYIS, ,
The sixth and final division here is that critical one where the classification is
made by correct opponent. Here there are two types: correct reasons to use in
the context of oneself, and correct reasons to use in the context of others.

KHYOD SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I RTAGS YANG DAG KYANG YIN, KHYOD KYI RTAGS KYIS DE SGRUB KYI PHYI RGOL YANG DAG MED PA YANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN PA, DANG PO'I MTSAN NYID,
The definition of the first is as follows:
Anything which is both (1) a correct reason for proving that
sound is a changing thing; and (2) a case where there is no
correct opponent for the particular proof in which it serves as the
reason.

SNGA RGOL RANG GIS RANG NYID LA BYAS PA SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I RTAGS SU BKOD DE SGRUB PA'I TSE, BYAS PA SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I RANG DON SKABS KYI RTAGS YANG DAG YIN,
Whenever the proponent seeks to establish something to his own mind, setting
forth "because it's a made thing" to himself in order to prove that sound is a
changing thing, then "because it's a made thing" is serving as a correct reason
to use in the context of oneself, to prove that sound is a changing thing.

KHYOD DE SGRUB KYI RTAGS YANG DAG KYANG YIN, KHYOD KYI RTAGS KYIS DE SGRUB KYI PHYI RGOL YANG DAG YOD PA YANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN PA, GNYIS PA'I MTSAN NYID,
The definition of the second type above is as follows:
Anything which is both (1) a correct reason for proving that
sound is a changing thing; and (2) a case where there is a correct
opponent for the particular proof in which it serves as the reason.

BYAS PA SGRA MI RTAG PAR SGRUB PA'I GZHAN DON SKABS KYI RTAGS YANG DAG YIN NO,
"Because it's a made thing" is a correct reason to use in the context of others,
in proving that sound is a changing thing.

The forms of debate:
The Traditional Debating Classes and Subjects
Over the centuries, each major Gelukpa monastery in Tibet has developed its
own unique curriculum, all based on the study of the five great books of
ancient Indian Buddhism. The structure of the different classes in the debate
park is designed around the progressive study of a student in the geshe
program through these five great classics, and this is where the core subjects
and even the name of the Asian Classics Institute come from.
There are fourteen different debate classes going on simultaneously at Sera
Mey Tibetan Monastery, and typically 20 to 22 years is required to pass
through the fourteen. Each of the classes has its own special name--something

like "freshman" or "sophomore" in the West. At any given night in the debate
park, the classes will be huddled in different spots spread around the park.
The best spots (under a couple of especially shady trees in the summer, or up
against a protecting wall in windy, cold weather) are given to the higher
classes. If a beginning class is very large, the debate master may choose to
break it up for the night into two or even three separate groups. Each group
starts out with a single attacker and, normally, two defenders; by the end of
the night, this may have dissolved into melee of eight or ten attackers bearing
down on the original two defenders, with a group of supporters huddled
behind them shouting out answers too.
Typical classes at present in Sera Mey might start out with sixty or seventy
young men, of whom only a handful--four or five--will actually make it to the
end of the geshe program. There is a custom at an advanced point in the
curriculum, around ten years into the program, to combine two of the classes
from that point on, so that there are enough monks left to make the debates
interesting.
The following is a list of the names, durations, and traditional subjects for each
of the debate classes at Sera Mey. It was compiled with the help of Khen
Rinpoche Geshe Lobsang Tharchin. It should be noted that this is the ideal
curriculum, and in the refugee monasteries of southern India events like an
unusually long monsoon season, an attack of tuberculosis, sudden changes of
plan by monastic officials, extra monastic ceremonies to be attended, a public
teaching by a great visiting Lama, or any number of other happenings can
conspire to lengthen or shorten the time needed to complete one's geshe
studies.
Year One
Class One: Beginning Class, Collected Topics
This class is Tibetan is known as duchung (bsdus-chung), since it is a beginning
(chung) class on the collected topics (bsdus-grva) of Buddhist logic and
perceptual theory, mostly according to the "Sutrist" (Sautrantika or mDo-sde-pa)
School, which is considered the second of the four schools of ancient India. It
is also the higher of the two schools of the Lower Way (Hinayana).
The original root text for this class is the Commentary on Valid Perception
(Pramana Varttika, Tsad-ma rnam-'grel), written by Master Dharmakirti (sLob-
dpon Chos-kyi grags-pa) around 650 AD. The principal monastic textbook is the
Collected Topics (Yongs-'dzin bsdus-grva) of the Master Tutor, Purbuchok Jampa
Tsultrim Gyatso (1825-1901).
The duration of the class is one year, and begins with a special ceremony of
initiation into the debate park. The students are typically around 14 or 15

years old; they have completed some elementary study of the collected topics
with their house teacher, and are already familiar with the format of debate
(called rikpay grotang [rigs-pa'i 'gro-stangs]). These students have also already
learned to read and write (in both the regular and cursive alphabets), and have
memorized many of the shorter prayers and texts.
In a pattern which will continue throughout their careers as students in the
geshe program, the class moves through a standard series of topics, each with
its own name--such as chokchu (phyogs-chos): the study of the subject element
in a logical statement, and its relationship to the reason. The class might
remain on a particular topic for say one to six weeks, and then move on to the
next, according to an undefined, organic schedule dependent on a constant
assessment of their progress by the great lamas who are instructing different
members of the class.
In the curriculum of the Asian Classics Institute, the topics of this and the next
class are represented in the following course:
Course XIII: The Art of Reasoning
Year Two
Class Two: Advanced Class, Collected Topics
This class is a continuation of the previous, and lasts for a year. Its name is
duchen (bsdus-chen), meaning the advanced (chen-po) class on the collected topics
(bsdus-grva).
Year Three
Class Three: Beginning Class, First Chapter of the "Ornament"
The name of this class in Tibetan is shungsar (gzhung-gsar), indicating that these
students are beginners (gsar-pa) in the first of the great classics (gzhung). The
foundation root text here is the Ornament of Realizations (Abhisamaya Alamkara),
dictated to the realized being Asanga ('Phags-pa Thogs-med) by the future
Buddha, Maitreya (rJe-btzun Byams-pa) around 350 AD. The principal monastic
textbook for this class is the Analysis of the Perfection of Wisdom (Phar-phyin
mtha'-dpyod) by Kedrup Tenpa Dargye (mKhas-grub bsTan-pa dar-rgyas), a
master from Sera Mey who lived 1493-1568.
These texts present the beliefs of the lower Middle-Way school (the lower half
of the fourth or highest school of the four, which itself corresponds to the
higher of the two schools of the Mahayana, or Greater Way). This school is
known as the Madhyamika Svatantrika (dBu-ma rang-rgyud pa), or "Independent"

branch of the Middle-Way, so named because of their belief that we must take
an independent object and discuss it in common terms to bring another person
to understand correct view. The entire study of this school is called, in the
monastery, the "Perfection of Wisdom," or parchin (phar-phyin) in Tibetan--an
abbreviation of the full term, sherab kyi parul tu chinpa (shes-rab kyi pha-rol tu
phyin-pa, or prajnya paramita).
This class also lasts for a year, and is devoted to covering only the first third
of the first chapter of the root text. (The first chapter is by far the most
extensive.) The topics covered in this and the following five classes are
represented in the following ACI courses:
Course II: Buddhist Refuge
Course XV: What the Buddha Really Meant
Year Four
Class Four: Intermediate Class, First Chapter of the "Ornament"
This class is a continuation of the preceding. It lasts for a year and is devoted
to the second third of the first chapter of Lord Maitreya's root text. The name
of the class in Tibetan is shung-nying (gzhung-rnying), meaning a study of this
great classic (gzhung) by students who are now more advanced (rnying-pa).
Year Five
Class Five: Advanced Class, First Chapter of the "Ornament"
This class is again a continuation of the preceding. It too lasts for a year, and
is devoted to the final third of the first chapter. Its name in Tibetan is shung-
nying gongma (gzhung-rnying gong-ma), meaning an "even more" (gong-ma)
advanced class of more experienced (rnying-pa) students of the great classic
(gzhung).
Year Six
Class Six: Class on the Second and Third Chapters of the "Ornament"
This class is a continuation of the previous, and covers the second and third
chapters of Lord Maitreya's text. It lasts for one year, and is named kab nyipa
(skabs gnyis-pa), since it is devoted to the second (gnyis-pa) and third chapters
(skabs) of the root text.

Years Seven and Eight
Class Seven: Class on the Fourth and Higher Chapters of the "Ornament"
The study of the Ornament continues in this class, dedicated to the fourth, fifth,
sixth, seventh, and eighth chapters of the root text. The eighth chapter is
considered especially important because it is dedicated to a thorough
description of an enlightened being. The name of this class is kab shipa (skabs
bzhi-pa), meaning the students have reached the fourth (bzhi-pa) and higher
chapters (skabs) of the root text. Each of the courses from this point on to the
end of the geshe program last for two years each.
Years Nine and Ten
Class Eight: Class for Supplementary Topics
on the Perfection of Wisdom
The next class is named after and devoted to the study of supplementary topics
on the perfection of wisdom known as surkul (zur-bkol), so called because they
are extensive treatments of particular subjects which are "extracted" (zur-du
bkol-pa) and expanded from much briefer references in the Ornament.
The four classic topics here are dependent origination (rten-'brel); the
permutations of the flowchart that leads to enlightenment, known as the
"community of the twenty" (dge-'dun nyi-shu); the levels of the form and
formless realms, along with their corresponding meditational states (bsam-
gzugs); and the very important study of the art of interpreting statements of the
Buddha (drang-nges).
In conjunction with the last, the members of this class will also engage in a
separate study of the "foundation consciousness" (kun-gzhi, or alaya vijnyana)
concept accepted by the Mind-Only (Citta Matra or Sems-tzam-pa) School, the
lower of the two Mahayana schools of ancient India, and third in the overall
scheme of four schools. This will in fact be the most time ever spent on the
beliefs of this particular school, although it is also touched upon later in the
"Middle-Way" courses.
In Sera Mey, the principal monastic textbooks used for the supplementary
topics are those on each particular subject composed by the masters Kedrup
Tenpa Dargye and Panglung Lobsang Tukje (sPang-lung Blo-bzang thugs-rje, fl.
18th century).

Years Eleven and Twelve
Class Nine: Beginning Class on the Middle Way
Entrance to the ninth class, where a student debater begins his study of the
higher half of the Middle-Way School, marks a major change in status. At Sera
Mey, it is at this point that the monk earns the right to vote upon questions
affecting the monastery at large during the regular assemblies. He has also
normally just finished his rikchung examinations, which in effect qualify him
to become, in time, a geshe.
In Tibet it was a custom at this juncture for the entire surviving class to
approach sponsors and raise the funds to make an important gift to the
monastery in appreciation of her kindness. The gift might be a set of rare and
important books, new paintings or images for the temple altars, or even a
building. Members of the class would also go into deep retreats, intended to
accumulate the good karma necessary to grasp the very subtle points of higher
Middle-Way philosophy, the next subject in the curriculum. It is considered
auspicious if the student encounters difficulty during this retreat (as the sign
of an effective attempt to eliminate previous bad karma), and our Root Lama,
Khen Rinpoche, has said that he became dangerously ill during his retreat in
Tibet at this time.
The name of this class is uma sarpa (dbu-ma gsar-pa), meaning "beginning" (gsar-
pa) class on the beliefs of the higher part of the Middle-Way (dbu-ma) School.
The root text is Entering the Middle Way (Madhyamika Avatara, dBu-ma la 'jug-pa),
composed by Master Chandrakirti (Slob-dpon Zla-ba grags-pa) around 650 AD.
The principal monastic textbooks used are the Illumination of the True Thought
of the Middle Way (dBu-ma dgongs-pa rab-gsal) of Je Tsongkapa, along with its
commentary by Kedrup Tenpa Dargye entitled Overview of the Middle Way
(dBu-ma spyi-don).
The higher half of the Middle-Way School is known as the "Consequence"
(Prasangika, or Thal-'gyur-ba) group, due to their belief that a logical statement
utilizing a ridiculous but necessary consequence of an opponent's erroneous
beliefs is especially effective in helping the opponent develop a correct view
of emptiness. The entire study of this particular group is called "Middle Way"
(Uma, or dBu-ma) in the monastery, although technically the beliefs of the
Independent group, already studied, also qualify as "Middle Way."
The topics covered in this and the next class are represented in the following
ACI courses:
Course VI: The Diamond-Cutter Sutra
Course VII: The Vows of the Bodhisattva
Courses X, XI, and XII: A Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life--Parts
One, Two, and Three

Years Thirteen and Fourteen
Class Ten: Advanced Class on the Middle Way
This class is a continuation of the preceding, and in Tibetan is known as uma
nyingpa (dbu-ma rnying-pa), meaning "advanced" (nying-pa) class on the beliefs
of the higher part of the Middle-Way (dbu-ma) School.
Years Fifteen and Sixteen
Class Eleven: Beginning Class on Vowed Ethics
The class then graduates to the study of vowed ethics (vinaya, or 'dul-ba); here
the curriculum of Sera Mey is unique, since the other major Gelukpa
monasteries continue on to higher knowledge (abhidharma, or chos mngon-pa) at
this point. This course will cover, extensively, the beliefs of certain groups
within the first of the four schools--the Detailist--on the eight different types
of vowed morality.
It is only here that a monk learns, in detail, the finer points of monastic rule.
The debates of this class are a sharp contrast to the high theoretical dialectic
of the Middle Way: here we are more likely to be quoting lists of monastic
guidelines, and memorization of the versed summary on the subject is a
"must." This is the Versed Summary on Vowed Morality by Kongpo Ngawang
Tsultrim (Shar-chen Kong-po Ngag-dbang tsul-khrims), an eminent lama from the
Kongpo College of Sera Mey.
The great commentary of the omniscient Tsonawa (Kun-mkhyen mTso-sna-ba
Shes-rab bzang-po), a Kagyupa master from the latter part of the 14th century,
will also be studied carefully. Both are based, as is the study of vowed
morality throughout Tibet, upon the Summary of Vowed Morality (Vinaya Sutra,
or 'Dul-ba mdo rtza-ba), by the Indian master Guna Prabha (Slob-dpon Yon-tan
'od), from about 500 AD.
The name of this particular class in Tibetan is senkyang dangpo (gzan rkyang
dang-po), since in the old days in Tibet it was only (rkyang) by reaching this
class that a student was first (dang-po) considered senior enough to wear a
heavy sort of monastic shawl (gzan) or cloak called a dagam, on the (very cold)
nights of winter in the Lhasa valley.
The topics covered in this and the next class are represented in:
Course IX: The Ethical Life

Years Seventeen and Eighteen
Class Twelve: Advanced Class on Vowed Ethics
This class is a continuation of the preceding, and is given the name dzindra
sumpa ('dzin-grva gsum-pa), meaning third (gsum-pa) class ('dzin-grva) from the
top.
Years Nineteen and Twenty
Class Thirteen: Beginning Class on Higher Knowledge
Year nineteen marks the beginning of the final subject, higher knowledge
(abhidharma, known simply as dzu [mdzod] in the monastery). The original root
text here is the Treasure House of Higher Knowledge (Abhidharma Kosha, or Chos
mngon-pa mdzod), written by Master Vasubandhu (Slob-dpon dbyig-gnyen) in
about 350 AD. This work primarily presents the beliefs of the Kashmiri section
of the Detailist (Vaibhashika, or Bye-brag smra-ba) School, the first of the four
Indian schools, and lower of the two Hinayana schools.
Three monastic textbooks for this subject are featured in the curriculum of Sera
Mey:
The commentary of His Holiness the First Dalai Lama,
Gendun Drup (rGyal-ba dGe-'dun grub, 1391-1474)
entitled Light on the Path to Freedom, an Exposition of
Higher Knowledge (Mdzod-tik thar-lam gsal-byed);
A resolution of difficult points on higher knowledge
popularly known as The Book on Higher Knowledge
by Gyalwang, composed by Gyalwang Trinley
Namgyal (rGyal-dbang 'Phrin-las rnam-rgyal, fl. 1850);
and
An exquisite, highly detailed commentary from the Sakya
tradition entitled The Chim Book on Higher
Knowledge, written by Jampeyang of Chim (mChims
'Jam-pa'i dbyangs, c. 1280).
The name for this class in Tibetan is dzindra nyipa ('dzin-grva gnyis-pa), so called
because it is the second (gnyis-pa) class ('dzin-grva) from the top.
The topics covered in this and the next class are represented in the following
ACI courses:
Course V: How Karma Works
Course VIII: Death and the Realms of Existence

Years Twenty-One and Twenty-Two
Class Fourteen: Advanced Class on Higher Knowledge
This class is a continuation of the preceding, and in Tibetan is called dzindra
dangpo ('dzin-grva dang-po), meaning it is the first (dang-po) class ('dzin-grva), or
the highest class of all. The minimum stay for a person in this class would be
two years, but this could stretch out into three, four, or even more years, since
a student is required to remain until he can complete his examinations for any
of the ranks of a geshe.
Annually for the Entire Geshe Program
Special Winter Classes on Buddhist Logic and Perceptual Theory
Throughout the entire length of a monk's career in the geshe program, several
months in the winter are reserved for special classes on Buddhist logic and
perceptual theory, based upon the Commentary on Valid Perception (Pramana
Varttika, Tsad-ma rnam-'grel) of Master Dharmakirti (Slob-dpon Chos-kyi grags-pa),
who lived about 650 AD.
The principal monastic commentary here is Light on the Path to Freedom, an
Explanation of the "Commentary on Valid Perception," by one of the principal
disciples of Je Tsongkapa, Gyaltsab Je Darma Rinchen (rGyal-tsab rje Dar-ma
rin-chen, 1364-1432). At Sera Mey, a new commentary by Geshe Yeshe
Wangchuk (dGe-bshes Ye-shes dbang-phyug, 1928-1997) is also very popular.
Normally each class simply takes its name from whichever major topic it may
be debating at the time.
One reason the text by Gyaltsab Je is so widely used is that it is studied in all
of the major Gelukpa monasteries, and can thus be used as common scriptural
authority during the annual Jang Gunchu, or Winter Debates--a kind of annual
Olympic intensive where the best student monks from each of the major
colleges can come together to study and debate, almost day and night, for an
entire month.
Here all the students from each monastery who are debating the same subject
join into a single class, which acts as an excellent preparation for the debates
they will have with each other during the geshe examinations down the road.
Back home, those from each monastery who did not qualify for the Winter
Debates continue on these same general subject; this provides a good
opportunity for students of medium or lesser ability to take center stage at the
debate park and improve themselves.
The topics for the Winter Debates are represented in the following ACI
Courses:

Course IV: The Proof of Future Lives
Course XIII: The Art of Reasoning
Special Teachings by Eminent Lamas
Throughout the geshe program, a student will also attend special teachings
given by eminent Lamas, both inside and outside their home monasteries.
Actual recent examples at Sera Mey, for example, would be a one month
teaching on the steps of the path to Buddhahood (lam-rim) presented by Geshe
Yeshe Wangchuk, or a teaching by His Holiness the Dalai Lama on emptiness.
The most frequent subjects of these teachings are either lam-rim or lojong:
developing the good heart. The content of these special teachings often comes
up later in the debate park, in conjunction with almost every other subject. For
this reason, the teachings on lam-rim and lojong have been organized into a
sixth subject in the ACI curriculum, and are represented in the following
courses:
Course I: The Principal Teachings of Buddhism
Course III: Applied Meditation
Course XIV: Lojong, Developing the Good Heart
*************
The invasion of Tibet led to a great deal of disruption in the debate classes.
For twelve years after the fall of Tibet in 1959, the surviving monks from all
of the major Gelukpa monasteries were thrown together in the Buxall refugee
camp in northeastern India. Only several hundred of over 10,000 student
monks from Lhasa lived through the invasion and subsequent horrors of the
Buxall camp, to reach their new home in south India.
In the early 1970's, land was found in the Karnataka area of south India for the
re-establishment of these major monasteries. (Khen Rinpoche's older brother,
a Tibetan government official, was instrumental in locating and securing the
land.) The debating classes and geshe examinations continued throughout this
time in a very tenuous way, and by the mid 1970's it looked as though there
would not be enough support for them to be carried on at Sera Mey.
This is when Khen Rinpoche began the food fund for students in the geshe
program, which proved to be a deciding factor in their survival. Khen
Rinpoche and his students also provided a great deal of the support needed to
revive the Winter Debates in India. The debate classes throughout the great
Gelukpa monasteries of south India now thrive, and the level of study is said
to rival that of Old Tibet.

Selection from the collected topics:
The Concept of Time
The following selections on the concept of time (Dus-gsum gyi rnam-bzhag), are
excerpted from The Collected Topics of Rato (Rva-stod bsdus-grva), by Master
Chok-hla U-ser, a great master of Rato Monastery who lived about 1500 AD. This
particular book is considered the "grandfather" of what came to be a separate genre of
literature in Tibet: the dura (bsdus-grva), or "selected topics from the Commentary
on Valid Perception (Pramana Varttika, or Tsad-ma rnam-'grel) of Master
Dharmakirti (circa 650 AD).

Here next is an analysis of the question of whether the past and the future
exist or not. Generally speaking there exist no definitions for "the past" or "the
future," because the past and future are not things which even exist. This is
because, anything which can be established as existing must always be existing
in the present [according to this school of Buddhism].

If though we were to establish the meaning of "the past" relative to a specific
point of reference, we could say that the definition of its past relative to the
time of a specific water pitcher could be given as follows:
Something which has, by the time of the water pitcher, already
started; and which has, by the time of the water pitcher, already
ended as well.
This and "the pitcher just before the pitcher" amount to the same thing.

GCIGBUM PA'I DUS SU GRUB ZIN PA YANG YIN, BUM PA DANG DUS MNYAM PA YANG YIN PA'I GZHI MTHUN PAR DMIGS PA, BUM PA'I DUS SU DA LTAR BA'I MTSAN NYID,
The definition of its present relative to the time of a specific water pitcher then
could be given as follows:
That one thing which is both (1) something which has already
come into existence by the time of the water pitcher; and (2)
which is simultaneous to the water pitcher.

The definition of its future relative to the time of a specific water pitcher,
finally, could be given as follows:
That one thing which is both (1) in the act of starting at the time
of the water pitcher; and (2) not yet started at the time of the
water pitcher.

BUM PA'I MA 'ONGS PA, BUM PA'I RGYU, BUM PA'I DUS SU 'DAS PA, BUM PA LA LTOS TE 'DAS PA RNAMS DON 
The following all amount to the same thing:
the not-yet-coming of the water pitcher;
the cause of the water pitcher;
its past at the time of the water pitcher; and
its past relative to the water pitcher.
[Translator's note: "Not-yet-coming" and "future" are the same word in Tibetan (ma-

GCIGBUM PA'I 'DAS PA, BUM PA'I 'BRAS BU, BUM PA'I DUS SU MA 'ONGS PA, BUM PA LA LTOS TE MA 'ONGS PA RNAMS DON

the result of the water pitcher;
its future at the time of the water pitcher; and
its future relative to the water pitcher.
[Translator's note: "Passing" and "past" are the same word in Tibetan ('das-pa).]

These assertions [about the nature of time] are all presented in accordance with
the beliefs of the "Logician" group within the Sutrist School. They would not
necessarily be acceptable to any other school of Buddhism. The Detailists, for
example, do accept ideas such as past karma and future karma, while the
Necessity group entertains unimaginably profound positions such as the one
that states that the destruction of something is a working thing.

Formal logic subject:
A Discussion of Incorrect Logical Statements
The following presentation on incorrect "logical" statements is excerpted from An
Explanation of the Art of Reasoning (rTags-rigs), by the Tutor of His Holiness the
Thirteenth Dalai Lama, Purbuchok Jampa Tsultrim Gyatso (1825-1901).

,GNYIS PA RTAGS YANG DAG GI LOG PHYOGS GTAN TSIGS LTAR SNANG BSHAD PA LA, MTSAN NYID DANG , DBYE BA GNYIS, DANG PO LA, DGAG BZHAG GNYIS LAS, DANG PO LA, KHA CIG GIS TSUL GSUM MA YIN PA, GTAN TSIGS LTAR SNANG GI MTSAN NYID ZER NA,
Here is the second major division of our presentation, in which we explain the
opposite of a correct reason: that is, incorrect reasons. We proceed in two
steps: the definition of such reasons, and their various divisions.
The first of these we'll discuss in terms of disproving our opponent's beliefs,
and then establishing our own beliefs. Here is the first.
Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
"Any reason where the three relationships fail to hold" is the
definition of an incorrect reason.

MI 'THAD DE, GTAN TSIGS LTAR SNANG MED PA'I PHYIR TE, GZHI GRUB NA, RTAGS YANG DAG YIN PAS KHYAB PA'I PHYIR,
This though is mistaken, for there is no such thing as an incorrect reason:
everything which exists is a correct reason [to prove something].

GNYIS PA RANG LUGS NI, DE SGRUB KYI TSUL GSUM MA YIN PA, DE SGRUB KYI GTAN TSIGS LTAR SNANG GI MTSAN NYID,
Here secondly is our own position. The definition of an incorrect reason for
a particular proof is:
A reason for a particular proof where the three relationships fail
to hold.

GNYIS PA DBYE BA BSHAD PA NI, SPYIR GTAN TSIGS LTAR SNANG MED KYANG , GZHI LA SBYAR NA, DE SGRUB KYI 'GAL BA'I GTAN TSIGS, MA NGES PA'I GTAN TSIGS, MA GRUB PA'I GTAN TSIG DANG GSUM, DANG PO LA, MTSAN NYID, DBYE BA, MTSAN GZHI SGRUB BYED KYI RIGS PA 'GOD PA DANG BZHI,
Here secondly are the various divisions of incorrect reasons. Although there
is not, generally speaking, any such thing as an incorrect reason, we can say
that there do exist the following types of incorrect reasons in specific contexts:
1) Contradictory reasons for specific proofs;
2) Indefinite reasons for specfic proofs; and
3) Wrong reasons for specific proofs.
We will discuss the first of these in four steps: definition; divisions; classical
examples; and supporting arguments.

Here is the first. The definition of a contradictory reason for proving that
sound is an unchanging thing is:
That one thing for which (1) the relationship between the subject
and the reason does hold for proving that sound is an
unchanging thing; and (2) the reverse relationship between the
reason and the quality to be proven also holds for proving that
sound is not an unchanging thing.
[A classical example would be: Consider sound. It is an unchanging thing,
because it is a made thing.]

Here secondly is our explanation of an indefinite reason; we will proceed first
with a definition, and then with the various divisions of this reason. Here is
the first of these.
The following is the definition of an indefinite reason for proving that sound
is an unchanging thing:
That one thing for which (1) the relationship between the subject
and the reason for proving that sound is an unchanging thing
does hold; (2) the reverse relationship between the reason and the
subject for proving that sound is an unchanging thing does not
hold; and (3) the reverse relationship between the reason and the
subject for proving that sound is not an unchanging thing doesn't
hold either.
[A classical example would be: Consider sound. It is an unchanging thing,

Here third is our presentation on wrong reasons. Again we proceed in two
steps of definition and divisions. Here is the first.
The definition of a wrong reason for any particular proof is:
That which (1) has been put forth as a reason for a particular
proof, but (2) for which the relationship between the subject and
the reason does not hold.

GNYIS PA DBYE BA LA, DON LA LTOS NAS MA GRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS, BLO LA LTOS NAS MA GRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS, RGOL BA LA LTOS NAS MA GRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS DANG GSUM LAS,
Here secondly are the divisions of wrong reasons for particular proofs. There
are three different types:
1) Reasons which are wrong relative to meaning.
2) Reasons which are wrong relative to a state of mind.
3) Reasons which are wrong relative to the particular opponent.

DANG PO LA, RTAGS KYI NGO BO MED NAS MA GRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS, CHOS CAN GYI NGO BO MED NAS MA GRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS, RTAGS CHOS THA DAD MED NAS MA GRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS, GZHI RTAGS THA DAD MED NAS MA GRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS, GZHI CHOS THA DAD MED NAS MA GRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS, RTAGS SHES 'DOD CHOS CAN GYI STENG DU 'GOD TSUL DANG MTHUN PAR MED NAS MA GRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS, GTAN TSIGS KYI PHYOGS GCIG SHES 'DOD CHOS CAN LA MED NAS MA GRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS DANG BDUN, MTSAN GZHI RIM PA LTAR,
The first of these may itself be divided into seven different types:
1) Reasons which are wrong because the very nature of the reason is
non-existent.
2) Reasons which are wrong because the very nature of the subject is
non-existent.
3) Reasons which are wrong because the reason and the quality to be
proven are indistinguishable from one another.
4) Reasons which are wrong because the subject and the reason are
indistinguishable from one another.
5) Reasons which are wrong because the subject and the quality to be
proven are indistinguishable from one another.
6) Reasons which are wrong because the reason does not pertain to the
subject in the way it has been said to in the statement of the
proof.

7) Reasons which are wrong because some part of the reason fails to
belong to the subject under consideration.
The following are respective examples of these types of reasons, in particular
proofs:

SKYES BU CHOS CAN, SDUG BSNGAL BA YIN TE, RI BONG RVAS BO PHUG PA'I PHYIR, ZHES BKOD PA'I TSE, DE SGRUB KYI DANG PO DANG ,
1)
Consider a particular person.
They are a suffering being,
Because they have been impaled on a rabbit's antlers.

RI BONG RVA CHOS CAN, MI RTAG STE, BYAS PA'I PHYIR, ZHES BKOD PA'I TSE, DE SGRUB KYI GNYIS PA DANG ,
2)
Consider the antlers on the head of a rabbit.
They are a changing thing,
Because they were made.

SGRA CHOS CAN, MI RTAG STE, MI RTAG PA YIN PA'I PHYIR, ZHES BKOD PA'I TSE, DE SGRUB KYI GSUM PA DANG ,
3)
Consider sound.
It is a changing thing,
Because it is a changing thing.

SGRA CHOS CAN, MI RTAG STE, SGRA YIN PA'I PHYIR, ZHES BKOD PA'I TSE, DE SGRUB KYI BZHI PA DANG ,
4)
Consider sound.
It is a changing thing,
Because it is sound.

SGRA CHOS CAN, SGRA YIN TE, BYAS PA'I PHYIR, ZHES BKOD PA'I TSE, DE SGRUB KYI LNGA PA DANG ,
5)
Consider sound.
It is sound,
Because it is something which was made.

SGRA CHOS CAN, MI RTAG STE, MIG SHES KYIS BZUNG BYA YIN PA'I PHYIR, ZHES BKOD PA'I TSE, DE SGRUB KYI DRUG PA DANG ,
6)
Consider sound.
It is a changing thing,
Because it is something that you see with your eyes.

LJON SHING CHOS CAN, SEMS LDAN YIN TE, MTSAN MO LO MA KHUM NAS NYAL BA'I PHYIR, ZHES BKOD PA'I TSE, DE SGRUB KYI BDUN PA YIN NO, ,
7)
Consider a fruit tree.
It must be a conscious thing,
Because its leaves curl up and night and seem to sleep.

GNYIS PA BLO LA LTOS NAS MA GRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS LA, RTAGS KYI NGO BO LA THE TSOM ZOS NAS MA GRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS, CHOS CAN GYI NGO BO LA THE TSOM ZOS NAS MA GRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS, GZHI RTAGS KYI 'BREL BA LA THE TSOM ZOS NAS MA GRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS, SHES 'DOD CHOS CAN MED NAS MA GRUB PA'I GTAN TSIGS DANG BZHI, MTSAN GZHI RIM PA LTAR,
This brings us to the second kind of wrong reason: the one that is wrong
relative to a state of mind. Here there are four different types:

1) Reasons that are wrong because the opponent entertains doubt about
the very nature of the reason.
2) Reasons that are wrong because the opponent entertains doubt about
the very nature of the subject.
3) Reasons that are wrong because the opponent entertains doubt about
the connection between the subject and the reason.
4) Reasons that are wrong because there is nothing that the opponent
has yet to understand.
The following are respective examples of these four, for particular proofs.

SHA ZA BSKAL DON DU SONG BA'I GANG ZAG GI NGOR, SGRA CHOS CAN, MI RTAG STE, SHA ZA TSAD MA'I GZHAL BYA YIN PA'I PHYIR, ZHES BKOD PA'I TSE, DE SGRUB KYI DANG PO DANG ,
1) The following proof, presented to a person who has yet to confirm to
himself that "flesh-eaters" [a kind of ghost] actually exist:
Consider sound.
It is a changing thing,
Because flesh-eaters are something which can be cognized through valid
perception.

2) The following proof, presented to a person who has yet to confirm to
himself that "smell-eaters" [spirits in the bardo or inbetween state] actually exist:
Consider the song of the smell-eaters.
It is a changing thing,
Because it is something that was made.

3) The following proof, presented to a person who doesn't know where a
particular peacock is:

Consider that mountain vale over there.
There must be a peacock living there,
Because we can hear a peacock crowing.

DPAL LDAN CHOS GRAGS KYI NGOR, SGRA CHOS CAN, MI RTAG STE, BYAS PA'I PHYIR, ZHES BKOD PA'I TSE, DE SGRUB KYI BZHI PA YIN NO,
4) The following proof, presented to the glorious Dharmakirti:
Consider sound.
It is a changing thing,
Because it is something that was made.

Here thirdly is our explanation of reasons which are wrong relative to the
particular opponent. There are three different kinds of these reasons:
1) Reasons which are wrong relative to the proponent.
2) Reasons which are wrong relative to the opponent.
3) Reasons which are wrong relative to both the opponent and
the proponent.
Here are respective examples for these three types of reasons, in particular
proofs.

the Sangkya, a non-Buddhist school of ancient India]:
Consider the intellect.
It is something devoid of mind,

2) The following proof, presented to a Buddhist by a member of the Unclothed
[or Jain school of ancient India]:
Consider a fruit tree.
It must have a mind,
Because it dies when you peel its bark.

3) The following proof, presented to a member of the Rejectionist [Lokayata]
school by one of the Unclothed [Jain] school [both non-Buddhist groups of
ancient India]:
Consider sound.
It is a changing thing,
Because it is something you see with your eyes.

SHOG*, , RGYAL BA YANG DGON PA'I GDAMS NGAG BZHUGS SO, ,
Herein Contained are the Advices of the Victorious One,
Yang Gunpa
The following advices are included in A Compendium of Texts on Developing the
Good Heart (Blo-sbyong brgya-rtza), compiled by the great bodhisattva Muchen
Konchok Gyeltsen (14th century), pp. 335-337. They were composed by Gyalwa Yang
Gunpa (1213-1258), an illustrious master of the Kagyu tradition. The verses are old,
and the copy that we have to work with seems to have a number of textual errors,
which we have tried to work around but have largely left uncorrected.
The Victorious One, Yang Gunpa, once said:

*, , 'DUS BYAS LA RTAG PA MED KYI,
,ZHEN MED KYI 'KHRI BA CHAD,
,'KHOR BA NA BDE BA MED KYIS,
,NGES 'BYUNG GI SKYO SHAS BSKYED,
Nothing that starts remains unchanged;
Have no attachment, cut the ties.
There's no happiness in this vicious circle;
Get tired of it, find renunciation.

,'JIG RTEN LA SNYING PO MED KYI,

The world is hollow and meaningless;
Do not trust the lie.
Your own mind is the Buddha;
Go and meet your friend.

,TSE 'DI'I GRIB SO YOL LA,
,THAR LAM RDOG SNA BSKUL 
CIG,'DU 'DZI'I BLO SNA RINGS SO,
,'PHYI PHYIS BLO SNA BTUNGS 
The hour of life is passing;
Start down the road to freedom.
Send away the many thoughts of the busy life you lead;
Bring to your side the many thoughts of what will happen later.

Everyone would like to stay, but no one has the power;
Try to think of something that will come and help you later.
It's hard to find a life with opportunity and leisure;
Now for once you have, so try to get the most from it.

Nothing but the Dharma means anything at all;
Throw the rest out like trash.
It all boils down to dying;
Pack light and take off now.

,YANG ,
He also said:

,'CHI BA SNYING LA BZHOG DANG ,
,BRTZON 'GRUS LA THANG LHOD MED PA'I GNAD YIN,
Put your death in your heart;
This is the key for checking
Whether your practice is tuned too tight or loose.

,'KHOR BA'I SKYON TSANG SOMS DANG ,

,GANG SHAR SO MAR BZHOG DANG ,
,'KHOR BA RANG GROL LA 'GRO BA'I GNAD YIN,

The King of Faith is thinking about your death.
The King of Practice is giving up on this world.
The King of Devotion is to see your Lama as the Buddha.
The King of Thoughts is to cut off your dependence
on seeing things as coming from their own side.

,GSUNG YANG ,
He also said:

,BDE BA THAMS CAD LDAN PAR 'DOD NA,
,'DOD CHAGS LA GNYEN PO THONGS DGOS,
If you want to have every happiness,
You must use the antidotes that keep you

,'DI LTAR ZAB CHOS KYI GNAD MA 'DUS PA MED PAS, GSOL BA THOB, GZHIG PA CHUG GSUNGS,
There is not a single important point in all of the teachings of the Dharma
which is not found in these words. Go then and pray for blessings; go then
and think hard about these things.

,YANG ,
He also said,

,DAD PA LA MI RTAG PA'I SO BA TSUGS,
,DGE SBYOR LA BRTZON 'GRUS KYI LCAGS KYIS BRAB,
Post the sentry of thinking about impermanence, and let him guard
your faith.
Beat the horse of your spiritual practice with the whip of joyful effort.

,DAM TSIG LA RANG SEMS KYI DPANG PO

Let your own mind be the witness who testifies whether you've kept
your pledges.
If you need an enemy to fight, then stop the five poisons that live
inside of you.

The "five poisons" are the mental afflictions of liking things ignorantly, disliking
things ignorantly, being ignorant, pride, and jealousy; these have appeared in the
verses just above.

,YANG ,
He also said:

,LHA CHOS KYI RTZA BA DAD PA,
,JO BZANGS KYI RTZA BA ZHEN 
LOG,'GRO DON GYI RTZA BA SNYING RJE,
,BYIN RLABS KYI RTZA BA MOS GUS,
,SANGS RGYAS KYI RTZA BA RTOGS TSAD GSUNGS,
Faith is the very root of all the Dharma of the Gods.
Feeling sick of this life is the very root of all fine people.
Compassion is the very root of working to help others.
Devotion is the very root of receiving every blessing.
Whatever realizations you have are the very root of the Buddhas.

,RTZA BA LNGA'O,
These are known as the "Five Roots."

,BSGYUR BA LNGA NI,
He also taught something called the "Five Changes":

,RTAG SEMS 'CHI BAR BSGYUR BA,
,CHAGS SEMS SGYU MAR BSGYUR BA,
,SDANG SEMS SNYING RJER BSGYUR BA,
,SPYOD LAM CHOS SPYOD DU BSGYUR BA,
,RNAM RTOG LTA BAR BSGYUR BA'O GSUNGS,
Change your idea that nothing will change into thoughts of death.
Change your desire for things into the realization that everything is
an illusion.
Change your anger into compassion.
Change the way you live now into a life of Dharma.
Change all the ideas you have into worldview.

,YANG ,
And he also said:

,'DAS PA'I RJES SPYOD PA 'GYOD,
,ZHEN GYI PHYI RNYOGS YIN GYI 
The legacy of the past
Is a life you can well regret;
Dregs from your old attachments,

Decide that all you see here is
The Realm of the Uncreated,
A taste of the Voidness Body;
Keep this with you now.

,YANG ,
And finally did the Victorious One, Yang Gunpa, speak the following:

,NA TSA 'DI YANG DAG TU GRUB PA MED KYI 'DZIN PHUR THON,
,KUN RDZOB TU LAS 'BRAS MI BSLU BA YIN GYI LAS NGAN SDIG SGRIB SBYONG ,

,CHOS BDUN PO DE SEMS LA 
ZHOG,NYAMS LEN NANG THOG TU SBYONGS GSUNGS SO, ,
Keep these seven Dharma teachings in your heart, and let your
Dharma practice be something that you do inside yourself:
1) This sickness didn't just happen by itself; so use the medicine and
get rid of it.
2) On the level of appearances, karma and its consequences never fail;
so clean away your bad karma, your bad deeds and your
obstacles.

3) The reality of things is beyond the mind; so reside in a state where
you hold to nothing. [This statement should not be taken
literally, but rather interpreted in light of the teachings of the
Middle Way.]
4) Grasping to things as self-existent is what forces you to take birth;
so cut the ties of all your hopes and dreams.
5) Your inner nature is the Body of Voidness; so recognize how sick
you are.
6) Whatever happens is a holy blessing; so think of everything that
happens as an attainment.
7) Think whatever you want; but don't think of anything as pain.

BLO SBYONG DON BDUN MA'I RTZA BA BZHUGS SO,
Herein Lies the Root Text of
"The Seven-Step Practice for Developing a Good Heart,"
Advices for Training Oneself in the Greater Way
The following version of the Seven-Step Practice for Developing a Good Heart was
excerpted from a "short woodblock" (dpe-thung) format edition, including the text of
Lord Atisha's Lamp for the Path, in the possession of Sermey Khen Rinpoche Geshe
Lobsang Tharchin. The text is quite old and had a number of apparent problems; the
following version has been compiled using several other editions for comparison.

Now there are a great many ways of teaching those advices for training oneself
in the greater way--the lojong, or instructions for developing the good heart.
In the tradition of the spiritual friend, the geshe, Chekawa, these instructions
are organized into a seven-part practice. These seven are:
1) Instructions on the foundation Dharma, the preliminary
practices;
2) The actual practice for developing the Wish for
Enlightenment [bodhichitta];
3) Learning to use problems as a path to Enlightenment;
4) A summary of an entire lifetime's practice;
5) The point at which one can say that he or she has
successfully developed the good heart;
6) Pledges to keep for developing the good heart; and
7) Certain advices on developing the good heart.

Part One:
Instructions on the Foundation Dharma,
The Preliminary Practices
The first of these is expressed in the following line of the root text:
Train yourself first in the preliminaries.

These preliminaries come in three parts: meditating on your spiritual
opportunities and fortunes, and considering how difficult it is to obtain them;
meditating upon your own death, the fact that you are impermanent; and
meditating upon the problems of this vicious circle of suffering.

Part Two:
The Actual Practice for Developing
The Wish for Enlightenment (Bodhichitta)
The second part, on the actual practice for developing the Wish for
Enlightenment, has two steps of its own: developing the ultimate Wish, and
developing the apparent Wish. There are three sections within the first of
these steps: the preparation, the actual practice, and the conclusion. For the
preparation, you should do the following: bring to mind thoughts of taking
refuge; make supplications; offer the various steps of the seven-part practice;
take your meditation position with your body carefully straightened up; and
then count your breaths up to 21, without losing track at all.

The second step, the actual practice, is found in the following lines of the root
text:
Learn to see all things as a dream;
Examine the nature of the mind, unborn.
The antidote itself is gone to is;
Let it go in the essence, source of all things.

The third step, the conclusion, is expressed in the next line of the root text:
Inbetween sessions, be a figment of the imagination.

The second more general step, meditating on the apparent Wish for
Enlightenment, has two sections: deep meditation, and the period after this.
Here is the first:
Practice giving and taking, alternately;
Let the two ride on the wind.

The order of taking's to start with yourself.

Part Three:
Learning to Use Problems
as a Path to Enlightenment
The third main part, learning to use problems as a path to Enlightenment, is
found in the following lines of the root text:
When the world and those in it are full of bad deeds,
Learn to use problems as a path to Enlightenment.

Here there are two different steps: how to think, and how to act. The first has
two sections of its own: the apparent and the ultimate. Here is the first:
The blame all belongs to only one person.
Practice seeing them all full of kindness.

GNYIS PA NI, 'KHRUL SNANG SKU BZHIR BSGOM PA YI, STONG NYID SRUNG BA BLA NA MED,
Here is the second:

Emptiness is the matchless protector.

Next is the step on how to practice in your actions:
The four acts are the supreme method.
On the spot, turn all that happens to practice.
Note by the Tibetan commentator: These four are accumulating masses of good
karma; cleaning oneself of bad karma; making offerings to harmful spirits; and
making offerings to protectors of the Dharma.

Part Four:
A Summary of an Entire Lifetime's Practice
The brief essentials of the instruction
Are combined within five powers.
In the great way these same five are the advices
For sending your mind; cherish the act.
Note by the Tibetan commentator: The five powers are those of resolutions for the
future; of accustoming yourself; of pure white seeds; of destruction; and of
prayer.

Part Five:
The Point at Which One Can Say
That He or She has Successfully Developed the Good Heart
All Dharma comes down to a single point.
There are two judges; keep the main one.
Be joy alone, in an unbroken stream.
It's there when you can keep it unthinking.
Note by the Tibetan commentator: The two judges here are yourself and others.

Part Six:
Pledges to Keep for Developing the Good Heart
Keep to the three laws.
Change your mind and stay the same.
Speak not of what was broken.
Never worry about what they're doing.
Rid yourself of the biggest affliction first.
Never hope for any reward.
Stop eating poison food.
Don't let the stream flow smooth.
Forget repaying criticism.
Give up laying ambushes.
No going for the jugular.
Load your own truck, no passing the buck.
Don't get fixed on speed.
Don't feed the wrong face.
Don't turn the sweet angel to a devil.
Don't look for crap to make yourself happy.
Note by the Tibetan commentator: The three laws are never acting in a way that
contradicts what you have committed yourself to; never placing yourself in a
dangerous situation; and never falling into the habit of discriminating between
others.

Do two at the two of beginning and end.
Bear with whichever comes of the two.
Keep the two at the cost of your life.
Note by the Tibetan commentator: The "two" in the second line are being well off
and being poor. The "two" in the third line are your general spiritual pledges
and the pledges of the instructions on developing the good heart.

Train yourself in the three kinds of hardship.
Take to yourself the three main causes.

Live in three ways that never get weaker.
Keep the three that should never be lost.
Note by the Tibetan commentator: The "three hardships" are learning to detect the
start of a mental affliction; to stop it; and to stop the habit. The "three main
causes" are finding a Lama, practicing the Dharma, and having all the support
you need to practice the Dharma come together. The "three ways" are feeling
devotion [for your Lama], joy [for practicing the lojong or instructions for
developing a good heart], and keeping your various vows and commitments
[through strong awareness and recollection]. The "three that should never be
lost" are virtuous actions in your actions, your words, and your thoughts.

,YUL LA PHYOGS MED DAG TU SPYOD, KHYAB DANG GTING 'BYONGS KUN LA GCES, , BKOL BA RNAMS LA RTAG TU BSGOM, , RKYEN GZHAN DAG LA LTOS MI BYA,

Act now, do the most important thing.
Don't get it backwards.
Don't be on and off.
Make up your mind and stick to it.
Figure out both and free yourself.
Stop thinking all the time about how wonderful you are.
Don't let little things get to you.
Don't change from moment to moment.
Don't expect any thanks.
Note by the Tibetan commentator: When you have trained yourself well in these,
then you will be able to do the following:

Turn these five signs of the days of darkness
Around us into a path to enlightenment.
These words of advice are the essence of nectar;
They were passed down through Serlingpa.
Note by the Tibetan commentator: The five signs are transformed into learning to
endure without anger; feeling inspired to practice; a feeling of sweetness;
thoughts of compassion; and great aspiration--and so the mind itself becomes
the path. [The five signs of the days of darkness, which are said to be going
on now, are: the darkness of the times, marked by strife; the darkness of
lifespans, which have dropped to less than a hundred; the darkness of
worldviews, very mistaken and difficult to change in people; the darkness of
mental afflictions, strong and protracted; and the darkness of beings
themselves, with minds and senses that are out of control.] The last two lines
are meant to indicate that this instruction is one with an authoritative source.

Karmic seeds from following this practice in my past lives
Were awakened, and the urge to teach this to others came to me
On many occasions. And so I have finished it, these words
Of instruction for beating the tendency of seeing things
As having some nature of their own, and I have ignored
All kinds of trouble and the derision of others to do so.

Now I can die,
Without a shred of regret.
Note by the Tibetan commentator: In these words, that king of all deep
practitioners, Chekawa, expresses the greatness of the instruction, for he has
succeeded in applying it to his own heart.
Incidentally, there are many different versions of this root text: some are longer
or shorter, and in others the lines come in a different order. I've set this one
down here following the version found in the book of instruction by the
bodhisattva Tokme.

When the holy Lama, the Great One, the Sachen, was twelve years of age, he

One day he had a direct vision of the Lord, Manjushri. His body was a russet
gold, and he sat atop a throne of jewels, in the midst of a great mass of pure
light. He held his hands in the gesture of teaching the Dharma, and sat with

a look of perfect beauty, flanked by a pair of bodhisattvas. And then he spoke
the following words:

,TSE 'DI LA ZHEN NA CHOS PA MIN,

A person who is still attached to the three worlds has no renunciation.
A person who is still attached to getting what they want is no bodhisattva.
A person who still grasps to things has no worldview.

And the Sachen thought carefully about the meaning of these words. And he
came to realize that the entire practice of the path of the perfections could all
be found here, in these words for developing the good heart, called "Freedom
from the Four Attachments." And thus did he come to an extraordinary level
of understanding all the things there are.

There's no way you can do without

Because you're attached to goals of this life,
Then you've planted the roots for living in
The eight worldly thoughts.
You'll disparage those whose ethics are less.
You'll feel jealous of those who keep
Their ethics well. The ethics you follow yourself
Will be done for the recognition of others.
You will plant the seeds for the lower realms.

The true sign that they have succeeded
In developing the good heart
Has come to any person who
Is full of twelve spiritual qualities

As the Ganges is full of drops of water
And the way the expanse of the whole night sky
Is covered with the celestial mansions.
["Celestial mansions" is a code word for the number twelve, since there are
twelve major constellations in ancient Asian astrology as well.]

Now you can always count on them,
They always repay the kindness received.
They lend a hand to all who come,
And are soft and gentle to everyone.
They are courteous in their behavior to others,
And act as a servant to all.
They listen well what needs to be done,
And greet you with a joyful smile.

And their courage is always evident.
Their places are clean and simple,
They are getting their paradise ready,
And the Dharma has captured their hearts.
People like this are truly kings
Of the great soaring lords, the garudas;
They will pass with speed to the heaven
Where the Youthful Guide holds court.

as a vigorous young man.]

In his explanation of Freedom from Four Attachments, the holy lama Drakpa Gyeltsen
describes the suffering of the three lower realms, and says we should "pity the man or
woman who ends up in those realms." The following quotation, from Lord Buddha
himself, is used by Je Tsongkapa and other eminent Lamas to explain just where these
realms really exist:

,SEMS CAN STONG PHRAG DU MA SKYO BSKYED KYANG ,

,'GRO BA DE DAG NAM YANG YOD MA YIN,
Lord Buddha spoke the following, in the Sutra Requested by Upali:
When I taught you of the terrors
Of the realms of hell,
Many thousands of those among you
Were frightened and dismayed.
But I tell you now,
That those people who die and travel
To these terrible realms of pain
Don't even exist at all.

There is no one to hurt you,
No one to cut you with a sword,
No one to thrust a spear through your body;
Everything that you see happening to you
Within these realms of terror
Is only a projection;
There are no instruments of pain there.

Flowers blossom in a rainbow
Of pleasing, elegant blooms;
Mighty structures crafted of pure gold
Steal your heart away.
But here too no one ever came
And stopped to do construction;
All of these were also built
By the single act of projection--
The whole world is but a creation
That comes from your projections.

Herein lie the instructions
on developing the good heart entitled
"The Wheel of Knives"
This work on developing the good heart was presented to Lord Atisha (982-1052) by
the Indian master Dharma Rakshita. The selections found here are taken from a
version in the Dharmsala edition of The Compendium of Texts on Developing the
Good Heart, pp. 96-110. Please note that many different editions of the texts exist,
with spellings that sometimes vary greatly; we have used some of these in the present
translation where it appeared more correct.

Now in this place desire is like
A forest of poison trees;

Bodhisattva warriors, like peacocks,
Are strong enough to take it.

For these same leaves are death to it--
How could those who only think
Of what they want themselves
Ever have the strength to eat
This poison?

The same is true with all the other
Mental afflictions there are;
These are enough to threaten the life
Of nirvana for those like crows.
The peacock bodhisattvas though
Turn the poison forest of
Their mental afflictions into opportunities,
And food to keep them strong.
They leap then into the forest
Of this vicious circle of life;
They make it an opportunity,
And thus destroy the poison.

Realize now that grasping for yourself
Is the henchman of the devil
And keeps you here in this vicious circle,
Helpless to help yourself.
Run now far from the state of mind
That only wants what's good for me,
That only wants what feels good,
And happily take upon yourself
Any hardship for others' sake.

Herein Contained are the Instructions for
Developing the Good Heart
Which were Passed Down
through the Master Translator of Sumpa

It happened that the accomplished saint named the Master Translator of
Sumpa travelled to India. While there, he was able to study a great deal of the
secret teachings. When it came time for him to return to Tibet, he took the
leftover gold he had with him and set off first to the Seat of the Diamond
[Vajrasana], so that he could make offerings to the site of the Great
Enlightenment.

One day after reaching the Seat of the Diamond he spent some time at the
Great Temple, walking around it in prayer, and sometimes pausing for a rest.
There was a woman there as well, in red; as he watched her walking around
the Temple too, he noticed that for awhile she would be stepping on the
ground, and then for a stretch that she stepped in the air itself, and then on the
ground once more.

Then there was a lady in green, and she walked at the side of the red, and she
said but four things:
I don't feel so well today. I have this urge to get going
somewhere. It would be better if people didn't have to die.
Death is a frightening thing.

The lady in red turned to the green, and with a sideways glance at the Master
Translator said but four things in reply:
My dear, once you've learned to be satisfied with whatever
comes to you, you will find happiness no matter what happens.
Your problem is that you are never satisfied.

MO DE SEMS BZHAG SAR SDOD NA PHYIN KYANG CHOG STE, KHYOD KYI SEMS DE BZHAG SAR MA SDAD PAS LAN NO, ,
My dear, once you've learned to leave your mind in one place,
you can go wherever you want. Your problem is that you've
never learned to leave your mind in one place.

My dear, once your mind has sunk into the Dharma, even dying
is an easy thing to do. Your problem is that your mind has never
sunk into the Dharma.

never realized that the mind is beyond all beginning.

And with these words, all the sadness that the Master Translator had ever felt
in his heart melted away. All the Dharma that he'd ever heard suddenly took
on meaning. And he would say that, at that moment, he gained his greatest
realizations.

Here is what the lines mean. The Master Translator would say that the point
about being satisfied with whatever comes to you means, among other things,
that one must learn to be satisfied with whatever level of material comfort
comes to you, since it concords exactly to the deeds of karma that you yourself
have collected in the past. Don't be jealous of the good things that come to
others. And never let yourself be sucked into events, whether they be pleasant
or unpleasant.

The point about leaving your mind in one place refers, among other things, to
the fact that you must learn to understand the true nature of your mind, and
keep it in its place, and then gain mastery over it--using the blessings of your
Lama, and unexpected but skilful means, to do so.

SEMS CHOS DANG 'DRES PA NI SEMS RIG RIG PO 'DI YIN, CHOS DE'I RANG BZHIN RTOGS PA CIG DGOS,
The point about mixing your mind with the Dharma refers to that knowingness
of the mind. You must learn to recognize the true nature of this Dharma.

The point about realizing that the mind has no beginning refers to realizing
how the mind begins. "Death" refers to it ending. There is no death anymore
for a person who realizes that the mind has no beginning, and no ending, and
no staying; and whose realization of these things goes on whether they are
within deep meditation or just come out of it.

Here is the lineage through which this teaching has been passed down to us.
It was spoken first to the Master Translator of Sumpa by the pair of the Holy
Angel--the Diamond Sow, Vajra Yogini--and the Lady of Liberation, or Tara.
He taught it to the Sakya Pandita, who passed it on to that great and
accomplished being, Tsotrangwa. He taught it to Kedrup Chuje, he to Ritru
Rechen, he to Prajnya Bodhe, he to Dunshakpa Buddha Ratna, he to Kirti Shila,
he to the Dharma Lord Gyalwa Sangpo, and he to the Dharma Lord Sunam
Rinchen--who granted it, finally, to Konchok Bang.

On a very special day once Lord Atisha was training his mind in the Wish for
enlightenment, bodhichitta, while circling a holy place on foot. Off to the east
then, up in the sky in the direction of the Seat of the Diamond--site of Lord
Buddha's enlightenment--he saw two women. Their bodies were something
just beyond a human form, but something just short of the divine; and they
were covered in precious jewels.

Janchub Kyab. Yeshe Shab granted it to Shila Vadzra, he taught it to Dunshab,
he taught it to Buddha Ratna at Laloy Gunpa, he taught it to Kirti Shila, he
taught it to Jaya Bhadra, and he taught it to Punye Ratna. Punye Ratna,

Now the Sutra Requested by the Realized Being Rashtrapala says,
Different beings must wander here
Because they have no knowledge
Of the ways of emptiness,
Of peace, and of things that never began.
Those with compassion use skillful means
And millions of different reasonings
To bring them into it.

What these lines are saying is that the real nature of all things is something
which is extremely difficult to perceive; and that if one fails to perceive it, one
can never be freed from the circle of suffering. Our compassionate Teacher has
seen these things clearly, and thus undertakes to bring beings on to a grasp of
this real nature, using a great many skillful means, and a great many different
types of reasoning.

DE'I PHYIR RNAM DPYOD DANG LDAN PA DAG GIS DE NYID JI LTAR YIN KHONG DU CHUD PA'I THABS LA 'BAD DGOS LA DE YANG RGYAL BA'I GSUNG RAB KYI DRANG BA DANG NGES PA'I DON RNAM PAR PHYED PA LA RAG LAS SHING ,
For this reason, those with the capacity of insight should make great efforts in
the various means of coming to a grasp of just what the real nature of things
is. This, in turn, depends upon the ability to distinguish between what is
figurative and what is literal among that highest of all spoken words--the
speech of the victorious Buddhas.

The distinction between these two is not something that words themselves
have the power to draw, saying "This part is figurative, and this part is literal."
Otherwise it would have been a useless exercise for the great innovators to
compose commentaries exploring the true intent of the teachings, undertaking
to make distinctions between what was figurative and what was literal.
Neither would there have been spoken, in that highest of spoken words itself,
so many conflicting versions of how we decide what is figurative and what is
literal.

'DI NI 'DI'O ZHES GSUNGS PA TZAM GYI LUNG GIS DE LTAR GZHAG PAR NI MI NUS LA DE'I TSE SPYI LA DE LTAR MA KHYAB PA NA BYE BRAG DRANG NGES LA YANG 'DI 'DI'O ZHES GSUNGS PA TZAM GYIS KYANG SGRUB PAR MI NUS PA'I PHYIR RO, ,
And look finally at the fact that--even if a scripture does say that "This is this
way, and that is that way"--this still does not enable us to decide that it really
is. If it is thus the case, throughout the teachings in general, that we cannot
draw any unquestionable conclusions from such statements, then why should
it be true--in this more particular case--that we can conclusively establish the
distinction between the figurative and the literal from any particular reference
that says, "This is the one, and this the other"?

DE'I PHYIR GSUNG RAB KYI DRANG NGES 'BYED PAR LUNG BSTAN PA'I SHING RTA CHEN PO DAG GIS DRANG NGES KYI DGONGS PA BKRAL ZHING DE YANG NGES DON GYI GSUNG RAB KYI DON GZHAN DU

Therefore we must go about our search for the true intent of the teachings by
following the two great innovators--those who the scriptures foretold would
be able to draw the distinction between the figurative and the literal. It is they
who have unravelled for us the idea behind the figurative and the literal; it is
they who have used true reasoning to establish, in a perfect way, those
teachings which are literal--by finding proofs against any attempt to interpret
them in some other light; and proofs in support of their being something
literal, not something figurative, not something we could say refers to
something else. In the end, we must learn to make this distinction through
immaculate reasoning alone.

And this is true because anyone who espouses some philosophical system that
contradicts reason could never be called a perfectly credible person; and
because the very nature of things is, moreover, something that must be
established by reason grounded in accurate perception.

Lord Buddha himself saw the truth of this highest form of meaning, and thus
spoke the following:
Whether you are a monk or some other thinker,
You must accept my words only after you've finished
A careful examination of them, testing them like gold--
In the fire, by cutting, and using the touchstone too.

And so it is that we proceed, in our task of distinguishing between the
figurative and the literal, in two steps, presenting first the ideas of the side that
uses the Commentary on the True Intent of the Sutras to help draw this
distinction, and secondly the ideas of the side that uses the Sutra Taught at the
Request of Never-Ending Wisdom to do so.

DANG PO LA GNYIS, MDO SDE NAS JI LTAR GSUNGS PA DGOD PA DANG , DE'I DON JI LTAR BKRAL BA'I TSUL LO, ,
The first step has two parts of its own: setting forth what the sutra says, and
showing how its meaning is commented upon.

The first of these parts has four further divisions: a question meant to clarify
apparent contradictions in the sutras; an answer that clarifies these apparent
contradictions; an identification of the nature of the three real natures; and a
statement, offered by the bodhisattva, of the conclusion reached by these
points.

Here is the first. We find the following in the Commentary on the True Intent:
O Conqueror, you have in many of your presentations made
statements that the heaps have some definitive characteristics of
their own. You have also spoken of their characteristic of
beginning, and their characteristic of being destroyed, and of
eliminating and comprehending.

PHUNG PO RNAMS KYI JI LTA BA DE BZHIN DU SKYE MCHED RNAMS DANG RTEN CING 'BREL PAR 'BYUNG BA DANG ZAS RNAMS KYI BAR YANG BKA' STZAL,
You also stated that the way in which the heaps exist is the same
for the doors of sense, and for things that occur through
interdependence, and for everything up to the different kinds of
sustenance.

The question continues in the same pattern through the truths:
. . .And you stated that these truths were something that had
definitive characteristics of their own, and were something which
we should comprehend, and something we should eliminate, and
something to bring about, and something to practice. And then
you spoke of the categories as having some definitive
characteristics of their own, and so too did you speak of the
various categories, and the many categories, and of eliminating
and comprehending.

The question turns too through the different groups among the 37 qualities of
enlightenment:
. . .You spoke too of these qualities as having some definitive
characteristics of their own, and you spoke of their nature of
being inconsistent, and of being an antidote, and of the growth
of what has not grown, and of the staying of what has grown,
and of there being no separation, and of coming back, and of
increasing, and of spreading.

And you said, O Conqueror, that no existing thing could have
any nature of its own; you said that no existing thing ever began,
or stopped; you said that they were, from the very beginning, in
a state of peace; you said that they were, by nature, something
that was completely beyond all grief.

What was it, O Conquering One, that you were truly thinking of
when you said that no existing thing could have any nature of its
own, and said that no existing thing ever began, or stopped;
when you said that they were, from the very beginning, in a state
of peace; when you said that they were, by nature, something
that was completely beyond all grief?

And so this is what I ask of you, O Conquering One: was it really
that which the Conqueror had in mind when you said that no
existing thing could have any nature of its own, and said that no
existing thing ever began, or stopped; when you said that they
were, from the very beginning, in a state of peace; when you said
that they were, by nature, something that was completely beyond
all grief?

The point of this question is as follows. In some sutras, Lord Buddha said that
no existing thing had any nature of its own, and so on. In other sutras though
he said that the heaps and so on did have their own definitive characteristics,
and so on. The bodhisattva knows that--if we take these two types of
statements on face value--then they contradict each other; but that it cannot
be the case that they do. Therefore he is asking Lord Buddha what he really
had in mind when he said that no existing thing could have any nature of its
own, and so on. The bodhisattva is, by implication, asking just what Lord
Buddha meant by phrases such as "existing by definition" and the like.

The term here "definitive characteristic" or "definition" [in "having definitive
characteristics" or "existing by definition"] has been explained in the great
Chinese commentary and elsewhere as referring to the particular verbal
definition of a thing. This idea though is incorrect, since--for one thing--the
sutra itself clearly refers to the idea of existing by definition in the parts where
it talks about constructs. Furthermore, even constructs have their own
particular verbal descriptions which are used to define them; so if this were the
meaning of "definition" here then there would be a problem if we went on to
describe them as not having any nature or definitive characteristics of their
own.

"many categories" otherwise, but if we refer down to what comes later in the
sutra itself then we should take them to mean the eighteen categories and the
six categories, respectively. The phrase "being no separation" refers to not
losing something.

The second division, an answer that clarifies apparent contradictions in the
sutras, has two further sections of its own: an explanation of just what "lack of
a self nature" it was that Lord Buddha had in mind when he said that nothing
had any nature of its own; and what it was that he had in mind when he said
"nothing grows" and the like.

We cover the first section in three steps: a brief presentation, an expanded
explanation, and illustrations for the points covered. Here is the first.

Lord Buddha replies by saying that, when he stated that nothing had any
nature of its own, he was actually referring to all three lacks of a self nature;
as the True Intent of the Sutras itself reads,
Listen, Paramarta Samudgata. When I said that no existing object
at all had any nature of its own, what I was referring to was
three different lacks of a self nature that existing things exhibit.
These three are the quality of lacking any definitive nature, the
quality of lacking any nature of growing, and the quality of
lacking any nature of being ultimate.

The Abbreviation also says:
What was it that the Conqueror had in mind when he said that
no existing thing had any nature of its own? I will tell you; he
spoke of that to disciples of varying capacities, and what he had
in mind was the three different kinds of a lack of self-nature. . .

The Thirty Verses says as well:
There are three different forms of this self-nature;
And what Lord Buddha had in mind
When he said that no existing object
Had any nature of its own
Was that there were on the other hand
Three different lacks of a self-nature too.
Let us consider, in light of these different references, the explanation by certain
people that--when Lord Buddha stated, in sutras such as those on the
perfection of wisdom, that no existing object had any nature of its own--he
was thinking only of every existing object belonging to the deceptive type, and
not of those belonging to the ultimate type. Anyone who holds this position
thus contradicts both the Commentary on the True Intent and the classics of
Master Asanga and his brother; they have moreover left behind them the
system followed by the realized father and his spiritual son [the realized being
Nagarjuna, and Master Aryadeva], and all the others as well.

When the bodhisattva asks Lord Buddha what he had in mind when he said
that objects had no nature of their own, he is really asking two different things:
what Lord Buddha meant by the expression "no-self-nature," and how it is that
nothing has any such nature. The answer by Lord Buddha addresses both of
these points as well, one after the other. We begin by explaining the first.

Consider all the infinite variety of objects that Lord Buddha was referring to
when he said that none of the existing things from physical matter up to the
omniscience of an enlightened being had any nature or quality of its own.
Lord Buddha grouped them into three different types of things with no nature
of their own, for two reasons: first because they are all subsumed by these
three types of things with no nature of their own, and secondly because it
would then be easier to teach disciples how it was that they lacked any nature
of their own. And this is because every existing object, whether it be
something of the ultimate kind or the deceptive kind, is included within one
of these three types.

Here's another reason why this is true. Lord Buddha stated, in the sutras of
the Mother and others as well, that none of the individual members of the
following groups had any nature of being a thing: neither the five heaps, nor
the eighteen categories, nor the twelve doors of sense. He said none of them
had any nature of being a thing, none had any quality of its own, and none
had any nature of its own. More specifically, he mentioned by name all the

different versions of the ultimate: emptiness, the sphere of being, the way
things are, and so on--and then he went on to say that none of them had any
nature of its own. What person in their right mind then could ever say that
there were no things of the ultimate type among those objects of which Lord
Buddha spoke?

Here next is the second step: the expanded explanation. Now you might think
to yourself,
Consider all those things that Lord Buddha was talking about
when he said that nothing had any nature of its own. Suppose
they are all included within the three different types of things
that have no nature of their own. What then are these three
types of things, and how is it that they lack any nature of their
own?
Let's begin by explaining the first type of thing that has no nature of its own.
The Commentary on the True Intent says,
Suppose you ask what we mean when we speak of the quality of
being a thing that "lacks any definitive nature." Here we are
referring to those things that display the attribute of being a
construct.

DE CI'I PHYIR ZHE NA, 'DI LTAR DE NI MING DANG BRDAS RNAM PAR BZHAG PA'I MTSAN NYID YIN GYI RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYIS RNAM PAR GNAS PA NI MA YIN PAS DE'I PHYIR DE NI MTSAN NYID NGO BO NYID MED PA NYID CES BYA'O ZHES GSUNGS TE,
And why do we speak of them as such? It is because of the fact
that these things display the attribute of being established
through names and terms; they are not things which abide by
definition; thus can we say of them that they "lack any definitive
nature."

TSIG DANG PO GNYIS KYI DRIS LAN GYIS KUN BRTAGS MTSAN NYID NGO BO NYID MED PAR BSHAD NAS, DE CI'I PHYIR ZHE NA ZHES PAS DE'I RGYU MTSAN DRIS PA'I LAN DU DGAG PHYOGS NAS RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYIS MA GRUB PA DANG SGRUB PHYOGS NAS MING DANG BRDAS BZHAG PA YIN PA'I RGYU MTSAN GSUNGS SO, , MDO YI DMIGS 'BYED PA 'DIS 'OG MA GNYIS KYANG SHES PAR BYA'O, ,
The question and answer that appear in the first two sentences serve to
identify constructs as what are being referred to when we speak of "things that
lack any definitive nature." The part that begins with "And why do we speak
of them as such?" serves as an answer to the question of what reason there is
for us to describe them as such. Then Lord Buddha answers by giving us two
reasons: one from the negative point of view, where he says that these things
do not exist by definition; and one from the positive point of view, where he
says that they are established through names and terms. The way in which the
sutra approaches the question from these two different aspects can be
understood to apply to the latter two attributes as well.

KUN BRTAGS LA MED RGYU'I MTSAN NYID KYI NGO BO NYID NI RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYIS GRUB PA'AM GNAS PA LA BYA'O, ,
The definitive nature of their own which constructs lack refers to their existing,
or abiding, by definition.

'DIR RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYIS YOD MED BSTAN TSOD NI MING DANG BRDA LA LTOS NAS BZHAG MA BZHAG YIN LA, BZHAG PA LA YANG YOD PAS MA KHYAB CING 'JOG LUGS KYANG THAL 'GYUR BAS YOD PA RNAMS MING GI THA SNYAD KYI DBANG GIS BZHAG PA DANG CHES MI MTHUN PAS RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYIS YOD MED KYI DON YANG MI MTHUN NO, ,
Here the question of whether something is said to exist by definition or not
hinges on whether or not it is established through names and terms; and it is
not necessarily the case that those things which are so established even exist
at all. What is meant by this "establishing" is furthermore quite different from
what the Consequence group means when it says that all existing objects are

established by virtue of terms that are names; and what it means then to exist
by definition or not is also something different.

'ON KYANG 'DI'I RANG MTSAN KYIS YOD PAR 'DZIN PA YOD NA THAL 'GYUR BA'I RANG MTSAN GYIS GRUB PAR 'DZIN PA YANG YOD LA GZHI 'GA' ZHIG SNGA MA LTAR MI 'DZIN KYANG PHYI MA LTAR 'DZIN PA NI YOD DO, ,
It is however the case that--if one is holding things to exist definitively as it
is described in this school--one is also holding things to exist by definition as
it is described by the Consequence group; whereas with a certain number of
objects one may still hold them in the latter way yet still not hold them in the
former way.

Here is what the second lack of a self-nature refers to. The Commentary on the
True Intent of the Sutras says:
Suppose you ask what we mean when we speak of the quality of
being a thing that "lacks any nature of growing." Here we are
referring to those things that display the attribute of being a
dependent thing.

And why do we speak of them as such? It is because of the fact
that these things have occurred by virtue of other factors, and not
all by themselves, that we say of them that they "lack any nature
of growing."

GZHAN DBANG LA MED RGYU'I SKYE BA'I NGO BO'AM NGO BO NYID KYIS SKYE BA NI BDAG NYID KYIS MA 
YIN PAS ZHES GSUNGS PAS BDAG NYID KYIS SKYE BA'O, ,
Given the phrase about "not all by themselves," the nature of growing that
dependent things lack, or their growing through some nature of their own,
refers to their growing all by themselves.

This would be a kind of growing where they grew independently, for as the
Abbreviation says,
Because things which are factors occur through interdependence,
we say that they grow by virtue of their conditions; when we say
that these are the type that "lack any nature of growing," we are
talking about their growing on their own.

Remember, this is a system which says that dependent things were spoken to
lack any nature of their own because they have no nature of growing in this
way; that is, through some quality of their own. They do not though say that
something has no nature of its own just because it does not exist by definition.

BO NYID MED PA YANG YIN NO, ,
There are two different ways of establishing the third lack of a self-nature; here
is how we establish the fact that dependent things have no nature of being
ultimate. The Commentary on the True Intent says:
Suppose you ask what we mean when we say that things "lack
any nature of being ultimate." Consider those things which occur
through interdependence; those which lack any nature in the
sense that they lack any nature of growing. These are as well
that which lacks any nature in the sense of lacking any nature of
being ultimate.

And why do we speak of them as such? Listen, Paramarta
Samudgata. What I have professed so thoroughly is that the
"ultimate" refers to the part of things which is the object of [the
path of] total purity. Because those that display the attribute of
being a dependent thing are not the object of [the path of] total
purity, we can speak of them as that one that lacks any nature of
being ultimate.

It is because dependent things do not exist as things which have any nature of
being ultimate that we can speak of that which does not have any nature of
being ultimate. The point here is that "ultimate" refers to anything which,
when you focus on and meditate upon it, your spiritual obstacles are brought
to an end. Dependent things though cannot be described as such, since they

do not have the power to help you purify yourself of your spiritual obstacles
if you focus on and meditate upon them.

"Now why," one may ask, "do you not also establish constructs as being
something which has no nature of being ultimate?" It's true that--if we were
to establish something as being such solely on the basis of its not being an
object of [the path of] total purity--then we would have to do so. It is due to
the fact that we are attempting to stop wrong ideas though that we do
establish dependent things as things which--because they are not objects of
[the path] of total purity--have no nature of being ultimate; but do not
establish constructs as things which are this way.

Why is this the case? Suppose that a person came to an understanding that
they could purify themselves of their spiritual obstacles by focussing on, and
then meditating upon, the fact that dependent things are empty of [certain]
constructs. It is possible then that they might entertain the thought
that--because to go through this process they had to focus upon dependent
things as an example--then these same dependent things would be objects of
[the path of] total purity. This in turn would mean that these dependent
things were ultimate. A person would not though entertain this same thought
about constructs.

DOGS PA DE'I SKYON NI MED DE SGRA MI RTAG PAR NGES PAS SGRA RTAG 'DZIN ZLOG KYANG SGRA LA DMIGS PAS RTAG 'DZIN MI ZLOG PA MI 'GAL BA BZHIN NO, ,
There is in actuality by the way no problem that this particular thought might
be correct. It's similar to the case where a person is able to stop his tendency
of believing that sound is an unchanging thing once he has perceived that it
is a changing thing. There is no contradiction in this example if one were to
say though that you would not stop your tendency of believing that sound is
an unchanging thing [simply] by focussing on sound.

GZHAN DBANG RNAM PAR DAG PA'I DMIGS PA LA DON DAM DU BYAS PA'I DON DAM DER MA GRUB KYANG DON DAM GZHAN DU GRUB MA GRUB NI 'CHAD PAR 'GYUR RO, ,
Despite the fact that dependent things do not exist as something ultimate in the
sense of being ultimate by virtue of being the object of [the path of] total
purity, there still remains the question of whether they exist as something
ultimate in other senses; we will cover this further on.

This second way of establishing something as a thing that lacks any nature of
being ultimate is, further, described as follows in the Commentary on the True
Intent:
Moreover, we also refer to that attribute of totality which things
have as being their "quality of lacking any nature of being
ultimate."

DE'I PHYIR DON DAM PA NGO BO NYID MED PA NYID CES BYA'O, , ZHES GSUNGS SO, ,
And why do we speak of them as such? Listen, Paramarta
Samudgata. We refer to that lack of a self-nature of objects
which all things have as being their "lack of a nature of their
own." The "ultimate" is delineated by being that simple lack that
every existing thing has of any nature of its own; and this is why
we can speak of the quality of lacking any nature of being
ultimate.

Totality in the sense of the lack of a self-nature of objects which all things
exhibit is an object of [the path of] total purity, and is thus on one count
something ultimate. But it is also delineated by the lack that things have of
any self-nature of the person, by this simple absence of something; and this is
why we can speak of all things as "lacking any nature of their own." This too
is a reason why we can say that things "lack any nature of being ultimate."

This point is supported by the Commentary on the True Intent where it says,
If the characteristic of being a factor and the characteristic of
being ultimate were unconnected, then there is no way that the
simple lack of a self-nature to factors and their simple lack of a
nature of their own could be their attribute of being ultimate.

The point is also supported by the fact that, in the sections where an
illustration is used, it is stated that the lack of a self-nature is established in the
same way as we establish empty space; that is, as being the simple lack of any
physical matter. It is therefore extremely clear that totality, in the form of the
lack of a self-nature to objects, is established for produced things as being the
simple absence of their imagined self-existence: the raw exclusion of some self-
nature to objects.

It is a complete contradiction on this subject to assert, on the one hand, that the
descriptions of thusness in this sutra are to be taken as literal; and on the other
hand to assert that this changeless totality is a self-standing, positive object: one
which is not established simply as the result of a process of exclusion--the
simple exclusion of what we deny when we speak of "no-self," and something
which we picture as an object in our minds only by relying on the act of
excluding what we deny by "no-self."

Remember that this is a school where we say that totality is a the simple
exclusion of a self-nature with regard to all things; and this is why Lord
Buddha spoke of the "lack of a nature of being ultimate." It is not though the
case that the school asserts that this absence has no nature of its own for the
reason that it has a nature that lacks any quality of existing by definition.

Here finally is the third step: illustrations for the points covered. These three
lacks of a self-nature can be described with three different illustrations. The
Commentary on the True Intent begins by saying,
You can view the quality of lacking any definitive nature as
being like the illustration of a flower that grows in mid-air.

It is, O Paramarta Samudgata, like this: you can view the quality
of not having any nature of growing as being like the illustration
of a magic show. And as for the quality of not having any nature
of being ultimate, you can view it in yet a different way from
those.

It is, O Paramarta Samudgata, like this: you can view this quality
as being like the illustration of empty space, which is delineated

by being a simple lack of anything with a physical nature, and
which extends to all things. The lack of having any nature of
being ultimate is the same: this particular quality is, in a way
different from those others, delineated by being a lack of any self-
nature to objects, and also extends to all things.

Saying that constructs are similar to a flower that grows in mid-air is only
meant to illustrate how they exist merely in the imagination; the point is not
to give an example of something that doesn't exist in the universe. The way
in which dependent things are similar to a magic trick we will explain later on,
and the point of the illustration used for totality is clear from the context in
which it appears.

This is the way one should explain how it is that things lack any nature of
their own when the sutra speaks of a "lack of any nature of their own." If on
the other hand one were to say that "lacking any nature of their own" meant
that none of the three natures existed by definition, then you would be
expressing the belief that the sutras which state that nothing has any nature of
its own are to be taken to mean exactly what they say. This would amount to
espousing the view that nothing exists, or the view that everything has
discontinued. This in turn would be discounting the existence of all three of
the natures; and we could say then that you had turned into one of those
people who holds the view that nothing has any definitive characteristics at all.

RUNG BAS DE LA SKUR PA 'DEBS PA YIN LA YONGS GRUB RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYIS MED NA DNGOS PO'I GSHIS SU MI 'GYUR BA'I LUGS SO, ,
How this works, according to this school, is the following: if it were not the
case that there were any dependent things that existed by definition, then they
could never grow or stop--and one would thus be discounting their existence.
If there were no examples of totality that existed by definition, then this could
never be the core nature of every functional thing.

Suppose, on this point, one were to raise the following question:
I can see how--if one were to hold the viewpoint that they did
not exist by definition--one would be discounting the existence
of the two natures. How is it though that you would be
discounting the existence of constructs?

The point is that, if it were the case that the two natures did not exist by
definition, then they could never exist at all. And if they did not exist, then
there would be no object towards which we apply the constructs, and none of
the terms that the one who applies the constructs uses. Constructs themselves
then would become something that did not exist at all.

In this same vein, the Commentary on the True Intent says:
I will explain to you my true intent. It may be the case that you
believe in things, that you fail to grasp fully the profound and
pure way that things really are. And then you will come to
believe, firmly, that I only meant exactly what I said about the
nature of all things when I said the following:
None of these things at all has any nature of its
own; and they are no other way. None of these
things at all ever grows; and they are no other way.
None of them ever stops; and they are no other
way. They are extinct, and have been so from the
very beginning; and they are no other way. They
have, by their very nature, gone completely beyond
the state of grief; and they are no other way.

If one were to start from this point, it would amount to
espousing the view that nothing exists at all, and the view that
nothing has any definitive characteristics at all. And once one
reached the point of espousing the view that nothing exists, or
that nothing has any definitive characteristics, then one would be
discounting the existence of all things, from the point of view of
each and every one of their attributes. This is true because one
would then be discounting the existence of the attribute of having
constructs for every existing thing; and one would also be
discounting the existence of the attributes of having dependent
things and having totality.

And why would this be the case? Listen, Paramarta Samudgata.
The point is that--if something displays the attribute of having
a dependent thing, and the attribute of having totality--then we
can understand it to display the attribute of having constructs.
This being the case, anyone who holds the opinion that the
attribute of having a dependent thing and the attribute of having
totality have no definitive characteristics at all would also be
discounting the existence of the attribute of having constructs.
Such a person, we would then have to say, would be discounting
the existence of all three of the attributes.

What does the "what I said" refer to in the sentence about "believing that I
meant exactly what I said"? It refers to statements in the sutras where Lord
Buddha taught that nothing has any nature of its own: where he stated that all
existing things are devoid of any nature which they have; void of any nature
of their own; void of any nature of existing by definition. Any school that
believed that these were to be taken just as they were spoken would be, in this
context, a school that "believed that I meant exactly what I said."
************

BZHI PA LA GNYIS, MDO DGOD PA DANG , DE'I DON CUNG ZAD BSHAD PA'O, , DANG PO NI,
Here now is the fourth division from above: a statement, offered by the
bodhisattva, of the conclusion reached through the preceding points. We
proceed in two steps: a presentation of the relevant passage of the sutra, and
then a brief explanation of its meaning. Here is the first.

DE LTAR NA GSUNG RAB LA CHOS RNAMS RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYIS YOD PA DANG CHOS RNAMS RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYIS MA GRUB PAR STON PA DANG , RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYIS GRUB MA GRUB LEGS PAR PHYE BA'I MDO SDE GSUM BYUNG ZHING DE DAG KYANG NGO BO NYID YOD MED LEGS PAR PHYE MA PHYE GNYIS SU 'GYUR LA PHYE BA NI DON GZHAN DU DRANG BAR MI BYA BAS NGES PA'I DON DANG , MA PHYE BA NI DON GZHAN DU DRANG DGOS PAS DRANG BA'I DON YIN LA, DE LA YANG GNYIS YOD PAS MDO SDE GNYIS DRANG DON DANG GCIG NGES DON DU SNGAR BSHAD PA RNAMS KYI SHUGS KYIS SHES PAR 'GYUR RO, ,
We see then that Lord Buddha has taught, in his highest of all spoken words,
three different groups of sutra: one in which he said that every existing thing
does exist by definition; one in which he said that no existing thing exists by
definition; and a third in which he made fine distinctions between things,
saying that some exist by definition, and some do not.
We see further that these various sutras can be grouped into two categories:
those that do and those that do not make fine distinctions between the
different ways in which things have no nature of their own at all. Those that
do make these distinctions do not need to be interpreted further, and are
therefore considered literal. Those that do not make these distinctions must be
interpreted further, and so are considered figurative. There are two groups of
the latter, and so we can say that two of the groups of sutra are figurative, and
one is literal. All this we can understand by implication, from the discussions
that have appeared earlier.

This way in which we speak of the three historical turnings of the wheel as
being either figurative or literal, this point that we arrive at through
implication from what has come before, is expressed to the Teacher by the
bodhisattva Paramarta Samudgata in the following words from the Commentary
on the True Intent:
O Conqueror, you taught first in the land of Varanasi, in the
forest full of wild animals, the wood of the saints; you imparted
a teaching on the subject of the four realized truths to those who
had entered, perfectly, the way of the listeners. And in doing so
you turned, perfectly, a wheel of the Dharma which was
amazing, and awe-inspiring; one which no being--neither god
nor man--had ever turned accurately in this world ever before.
And Conqueror, this perfect turning of the wheel of the Dharma
was one which had something higher; it was one which left an
opening; it was one which had to be interpreted further; and it
was one which could serve as a basis for contention.

And then, O Conqueror, you turned the wheel of the Dharma a
second time, for the benefit of those who had entered, perfectly,
the greater way. This time you took an appearance of speaking
of emptiness, doing so by bringing up first the fact that no
existing thing could ever have any nature of its own--and then
going on to the facts that nothing could ever grow; and that
nothing could ever stop; and that everything was extinct from the
very beginning, and that everything was, by its very nature,
completely beyond all grief.
This turning of the wheel of the Dharma was one which was ever
so amazing, and ever so awe-inspiring. And Conqueror, this
turning of the wheel of the Dharma as well was one which had
something higher; it was one which left an opening; it was one
which had to be interpreted further; and it was one which could
serve as a basis for contention.

And then, O Conqueror, you turned the wheel of the Dharma a
third time, imparting a teaching to those who had entered,
perfectly, every one of the different ways: you spoke to them of
how to make the fine distinctions. And you did this by bringing
up first the fact that no existing thing could ever have any nature
of its own--and then going on to the facts that nothing could
ever grow; and that nothing could ever stop; and that everything
was extinct from the very beginning, and that everything was, by
its very nature, completely beyond all grief. This too was a
turning of the wheel which was amazing, and awe-inspiring.

But Conqueror, this turning of the wheel of the Dharma was one
which had nothing higher; it was one which left no opening; it
was one which could be taken literally; and it was one which
could never serve as a basis for contention.

On the Different Methods of Interpretation
The following selection is taken from the Essence of Eloquence, a Classical
Commentary on Distinguishing between the Figurative and the Literal (Drang-
ba dang nges-pa'i don rnam-par 'byed-pa'i bstan-bcos Legs-bshad snying-po),
by Je Tsongkapa (1357-1419); ff. 13a-14a in the ACIP digital edition (catalog number
S5396), and pp. 31-34 in the ACIP Indian paper edition. The translation is based
upon an oral teaching of the text by Geshe Tupten Rinchen of Sera Mey Tibetan
Monastery. Please note that Je Tsongkapa's root text is extremely difficult, and is best
studied with the accompanying ACI tapes.

Here is the second part from above: a brief explanation of the distinction
between teaching which is figurative and teaching which is literal. The
Chinese commentary refers to these different turnings of the wheel as follows.
The first is the "Turning of the Wheel on the Four Truths," and the second is
the "Turning of the Wheel on How Nothing Exists by Definition." The third
is called the "Turning of the Wheel on Ascertaining the Ultimate." If we follow
the actual wording of the sutra itself though we would refer to the third one
as the "Turning of the Wheel on Fine Distinctions."

Now the way in which this particular sutra decides whether a teaching is
figurative or literal hinges on the two of whether it makes certain fine
distinctions or not. What it is that we are trying to decide is figurative or
literal consists of all three of the teachings: the one in which it was stated
equally for all existing objects that they have some nature of their own, one
which exists by definition; the one in which it was stated equally for all
existing objects that they have no such nature; and the one in which fine
distinctions were made between them, stating that some did and some did not
have such a nature.
The fact that these three are what we are trying to decide is figurative or not
is extremely clear from the following:
1) from the fact that the question in which the bodhisattva is
trying to rule out any apparent inconsistencies, and the answer
that is given, relate to the various groups of sutra;
2) from the way in which three lacks of a self nature are set forth
for every existing thing, and the statement about nothing having
any nature of its own explained in terms of this treatment; and
3) from the way in which the three turnings of the wheel,
delivered as they were during specific periods, are thereby
understood as being either figurative or literal.

Therefore what is being indicated as figurative with regard to the first wheel
is that teaching which relates to the initial period, and which starts off from the
four realized truths to make statements such as that all existing things exist by
definition; it is not though the case that we are referring to everything that
Lord Buddha ever spoke during this initial period. Remember that he did, for
example, make statements during this initial period such as his advice to the
Group of Five at Varanasi urging them to "be sure to wear your lower robes
in a neat circle." This is not the kind of teaching that we are concerned with
here, the kind that we have to analyze to find out what it means.

Just so, the second turning of the wheel is defined here according to whether
Lord Buddha made statements such as the one about nothing having any
nature of its own. There are other groups of sutras that do also relate to the
second period of Lord Buddha's teaching, but which are not taught from the
point of view of things not having any nature of their own, or the like. But
since these are not the kinds of teachings about which one might have
questions of the kind that arise in the section of the sutra where the
bodhisattva tries to clarify some apparent inconsistencies, they need not be
clarified here as teachings which are figurative.

The third turning of the wheel that is explained as being literal too is the one
mentioned before: the teachings in which those fine distinctions are made, and
not just everything that was spoken. This fact is made exceedingly clear in the
sutra itself. Lord Buddha, for example, did as he was just about to enter his
final nirvana give a teaching on what he declared would be appropriate
monastic behavior entitled the Summary of Vowed Morality. This is not though
a teaching which this sutra is explaining as being a literal teaching.

One may ask the following question:
What is it that this particular sutra hopes to accomplish by
distinguishing the various turnings of the wheel into those that
are figurative and those that are literal?
The sutra first seeks to prevent us from taking on face value those teachings
which state either that all existing objects exist by definition, or that none exist
by definition, without making any attempt to distinguish them into parts. It
seeks to inform us that constructs do not exist by definition, but that the other
two natures do exist by definition. It finally seeks to teach us that that form
of emptiness represented by the absence of those constructs in dependent
things is the ultimate object perceived by the path. This then is why the sutra
states that the first two turnings of the wheel are figurative, and the final
turning literal.

Given all this, some have used the wording of this sutra to go on and claim
that it proves that everything which Lord Buddha taught during all the periods
is meant to be taken literally. These people would then have to say that
certain statements which the Buddha made to attract those of other religions
who still believed that things could have some self-nature are teachings that
we are meant to take on face value. They also say that no object but the real
nature of things is anything more than the simple delusion of a mistaken state
of mind; these other things have not the slightest bit of an existing nature to
them. They say finally that the meaning of "fine distinctions" is the distinction
between what exists in truth or not, in the sense of being this one true thing:
the real nature of things.

Others have had the concern that--if they were to make the distinction
between the figurative and the literal in the way in which this particular sutra
does so--then they would be forced to make the same claims as the group just
mentioned. Therefore they deny this aspect of the sutra, saying that this
method of distinguishing between the figurative and the literal cannot be
something meant to be taken on face value.

Neither of these two positions seems to have examined carefully how, in this
sutra, the bodhisattva raises questions seeking to explain apparent
inconsistencies in the sutras; or how the Teacher gives his answer; or how,
based on this exchange, certain teachings are said to be figurative, and others
literal. They simply seem to be different arguments about the period
represented by the teachings which make the distinction between the figurative
and the literal.

The following selection is taken from An Analysis of the Distinction between the
Figurative and the Literal, a textbook used at Sera Mey Tibetan Monastery for the
study of this subject. It was written by Kedrup Tenpa Dargye (1493-1568), and gives
both a good sense of the detail in which the monastic textbooks treat their topics, and
also a great deal more information on the three turnings of the wheel in relation to
interpreting what the Buddha has stated. Several typical dialectic sections are
presented here (from folios 1a-5a of the original text), followed by a brief resolution of
the questions raised (from folios 9a-10a). The text is used is the edition with ACIP
electronic catalog number S0011.

Here is the second part [of the traditional presentation on the art of
interpretation]: a more detailed treatment of how we comment upon the
turning of the wheel of the Dharma in the sense of the physical teachings; that
is, how we decide which teachings were literal, and which were figurative.
This part itself has two divisions: an explanation of the system of the Mind-
Only School, and an explanation of the system of the Middle-Way School. The
first of these has three sections of its own; here is the first of them.

Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
Any sutra that the Conqueror spoke during the initial period
necessarily belongs to the turning of the wheel where he taught
the four realized truths.
Any sutra that he spoke during the middle period necessarily
belongs to the turning of the wheel where he taught that nothing
exists by definition.
Any sutra that he spoke during the final period necessarily
belongs to the turning of the wheel where he made fine
distinctions.

Well then, is it the case that--if something is a sutra that the Conqueror spoke
during the initial period--it necessarily belongs to the turning of the wheel, as
described explicitly in the Commentary on the True Intent, where he taught the
four realized truths, and so on?
[Why do you say that?]
Because your own assertion is correct.

[I agree that it is the case that--if something is a sutra that the
Conqueror spoke during the initial period--it necessarily belongs to the
turning of the wheel, as described explicitly in the Commentary on the
True Intent, where he taught the four realized truths, and so on.]

But you can't agree, because the times when Lord Buddha turned the wheel of
the Dharma, as described in the Commentary on the True Intent, are not defined
solely on the basis of the period in which they occurred.

Here secondly is the position held by our own school. The definition of the
first stage of the teachings, the turning of the wheel of the Dharma where Lord
Buddha taught the four realized truths, is:
Those sutras of the lower way which were taught during the
initial period, and in which the Conqueror expressed his message
by taking--as the principal subject matter which he described
explicitly--the four realized truths, intending the teaching for
specific disciples belonging to the lower way.

A prime example of this turning of the wheel would be something like the
following words of sutra:
O monks, this is the realized truth of suffering. This is the
realized truth of the source of suffering. This is the realized truth
of the end of suffering. This is the realized truth of the path to
the end of suffering.

something you have to bring about. The path is something you
have to practice.

Suffering is something you have to be aware is happening; then
there will be nothing left to be aware of. The source is
something you have to eliminate; then there will be nothing left
to eliminate. The end is something you have to bring about; then
there will be nothing left to bring about. The path is something

The definition of the middle stage of the teachings, the turning of the wheel of
the Dharma where Lord Buddha taught that nothing exists by definition, is:
Those sutras of the higher way which were taught during the
middle period, and in which the Conqueror expressed his
message by taking--as the principal subject matter which he
described--the subtle object of emptiness, intending the teaching
for specific disciples belonging to the higher way, and possessed
of higher powers.

MTSAN GZHI NI, RGYAS 'BRING BSDUS GSUM DANG , SDUD PA SHES RAB SNYING PO DANG BCAS PA YIN,

Those sutras of the higher way which were taught during the
final period, and in which the Conqueror expressed his message
by taking--as the principal subject matter which he
described--either the subtle form of a lack of a self-nature to
objects, the grosser form, or both, intending the teaching for
specific disciples belonging to the higher way.

A prime example of this turning of the wheel would be sutras such as the
"Chapter Requested by the Bodhisattva Paramarta Samudgata"; the section of
the "Chapter Requested by Maitreya" from the Commentary on the True Intent
known as "Maitreya and the Reflection in which Single-Pointed Concentration
Plays."

The above are, by the way, only primary descriptions; if one were to eliminate
all the problematic wording in them carefully, then the definition of the first
stage of the teachings, the turning of the wheel of the Dharma where Lord
Buddha taught the four realized truths, would be:
A sutra of the lower way, whichever of the three turnings of the
wheel it belongs to.

The definition of the middle stage of the teachings, the turning of the wheel of
the Dharma where Lord Buddha taught that nothing exists by definition,
would be:
A sutra that (1) belongs to some one of the three turnings of the
wheel as described in the Commentary on the True Intent, and
which (2) was intended primarily for disciples belonging to the
greater way, but of the kind who did not require a re-
interpretation of the middle turning of the wheel through some
teaching like the "Chapter Requested by the Bodhisattva Parmarta
Samudgata."

The definition of the final stage of the teachings, the turning of the wheel of
the Dharma where the fine distinctions were made, would then be:
A sutra that (1) belongs to some one of the three turnings of the
wheel as described in the Commentary on the True Intent, and
which (2) was intended primarily for disciples belonging to the
greater way, and of the kind who did require a re-interpretation
of the middle turning of the wheel through some teaching like
the "Chapter Requested by the Bodhisattva Parmarta Samudgata."
Prime examples would be the same as above.

Now there is a reason why the sutra says that the specific disciples for whom
the final stage of the teachings, the turning of the wheel of the Dharma where
fine distinctions were made, were "those who had entered, perfectly, every one
of the different ways." The point is that the specific disciples for whom the
first wheel was turned are capable only of grasping the system of the three
attributes with regard to the version of the lack of a self-nature of persons that
was presented during the first turning of the wheel. They are not capable of
grasping the system of the three attributes with regard to the lack of a self-
nature of objects treated by the middle turning of the wheel.

Specific disciples for whom the middle wheel was turned are capable of
grasping the system of the three attributes with regard to the lack of a self-
nature of objects treated by the middle turning of the wheel with requiring any
re-interpretation of this middle turning by any other sutra.

Specific disciples for whom the final wheel was turned are not capable of
grasping the system of the three attributes with regard to the lack of a self-
nature of objects treated by the middle turning of the wheel without a re-
interpretation of this middle turning of the wheel through some teaching like
the "Chapter Requested by the Bodhisattva Paramarta Samudgata."

When we say that they "are immediately capable of grasping the system of the
three attributes with regard to the lack of a self-nature of objects treated by the
middle turning of the wheel if they do rely on a re-interpretation of this
middle turning of the wheel through some teaching like the "Chapter
Requested by the Bodhisattva Paramarta Samudgata," the implication is that
they are already a disciple who understands the system of the three attributes
with regard to the lack of a self-nature of the person presented during the first
turning of the wheel. And this is why the sutra speaks of those of "every one
of the different ways."
Master Asanga on Avoiding the Two Extremes
The following selection is taken from the Essence of Eloquence, a Classical
Commentary on Distinguishing between the Figurative and the Literal (Drang-
ba dang nges-pa'i don rnam-par 'byed-pa'i bstan-bcos Legs-bshad snying-po),
by Je Tsongkapa (1357-1419); ff. 14a-18a in the ACIP digital edition (catalog number
S5396), and pp. 34-44 in the ACIP Indian paper edition. The translation is based
upon an oral teaching of the text by Geshe Tupten Rinchen of Sera Mey Tibetan
Monastery. Please note that Je Tsongkapa's root text is extremely difficult, and is best
studied with the accompanying ACI tapes.

GNYIS PA LA GNYIS, SLOB DPON THOGS MED KYIS GTZO BOR DGONGS 'GREL LA BRTEN TSUL DANG , DE LA BRTEN NAS DE KHO NA NYID GTAN LA PHAB PA'I TSUL LO, ,
Here begins the second major part in our discussion of the art of interpretation
according to the Commentary on the True Intent; that is, an explanation of how
this sutra is commented upon. We proceed in two steps: a description of how
Master Asanga relies, primarily, on the Commentary; and a description of how
he sets forth the meaning of thusness, based on this approach.

DANG PO NI, BSDU BA LAS, DON DAM PA MTSAN NYID LNGA DANG LDAN PA YANG DGONGS 'GREL LAS 'BYUNG BA BZHIN SHES PAR BYA'O, , ZHES DGONGS 'GREL GYI DON DAM PA'I LE'U RNAMS DRANGS SHING , CHOS RNAMS KYI MTSAN NYID NI DGONGS 'GREL LAS 'BYUNG BA BZHIN BLTA BAR BYA'O, , ZHES MTSAN NYID GSUM STON PA'I MTSAN NYID KYI LE'U RNAMS DRANGS LA, CHOS RNAMS KYI NGO BO NYID MED PA'I MTSAN NYID NI DGONGS 'GREL LAS 'BYUNG BA BZHIN BLTA BAR BYA'O, , ZHES MDO SDE LA 'GAL SPONG GI DRIS LAN DANG DRANG NGES LA SOGS PA RNAMS STON PA'I NGO BO NYID MED PA'I LE'U RNAMS DRANGS SO, , GNYIS PA LA GNYIS, SLOB DPON THOGS MED KYIS GTZO BOR DGONGS 'GREL LA BRTEN TSUL DANG , DE LA BRTEN NAS DE KHO NA NYID GTAN LA PHAB PA'I TSUL LO, ,
Here is the first. In the Compendium, Master Asanga cites the chapters on the
ultimate from the Commentary on the True Intent, saying--
You should understand the ultimate as having five characteristics,
as described in the Commentary on the True Intent.
He also cites the chapters that treat the three attributes, in the words:
You should view the attributes of all existing things as these are
described in the Commentary on the True Intent.
He further cites the chapters on how things lack any nature of their very own,
the ones that relate topics like the question and the answer about apparent

inconsistencies in the sutras, and the distinction between teachings that are
figurative and those that are literal, like this:
You should view, for every existing thing, the characteristic of
lacking any nature of its own as described in the Commentary on
the True Intent.

DE BZHIN DU RNAM SHES TSOGS BRGYAD DANG MTHAR THUG RIGS NGES PA YANG DGONGS 'GREL NAS GSUNGS PA RNAMS DRANGS SO, ,
Master Asanga further refers to the idea of the group of eight different kinds
of consciousness, and the idea that--ultimately--there are three fixed tracks,
both as they are spoken in the Commentary on the True Intent.

BYANG SA'I DE KHO NA'I LE'U DANG DE'I RNAM PAR GTAN LA DBAB PA DANG THEG BSDUS LAS KYANG DGONGS 'GREL LAS GZHAN DBANG NGO BO DANG KHYAD PAR DU BTAGS PA'I KUN BRTAGS KYIS STONG PA YONGS GRUB TU GSUNGS PA NYID BSHAD PA'I RNAMS GRANGS MANG POS GTAN LA 'BEBS PAR MDZAD DO, ,
In others of his works--in the "Chapter on Thusness" from the Levels of the
Bodhisattvas, in the treatise upon it, and in the Compendium as well--he makes
his presentation using a great number of explanations which come from the
Commentary on the True Intent: explanations which show how Lord Buddha
stated that totality consists of the absence of constructs relating to the basic
object and to its details, with regard to dependent things.

Consider too the presentations of thusness found in the Jewel of the Sutras, in
Distinguishing the Middle from the Extremes, and the various crucial points found
in the commentaries upon these texts. They also are in very close agreement
with the explanations found in our sutra, and so we can say that it appears
that setting forth the meaning of this sutra forms the very foundation of this
[Mind-Only] system.

GNYIS PA LA GSUM, MTHA' GNYIS SPONG TSUL SPYIR BSTAN PA, SGRO 'DOGS KYI MTHA' BYE BRAG TU DGAG PA, DES GSUNG RAB KYI DRANG NGES 'BYED PA'I TSUL LO, ,
Here secondly is our description of how Master Asanga sets forth the meaning
of thusness, based on this approach of relying primarily upon the Commentary
on the True Intent. Here there are three steps: a general presentation of how
one avoids the two extremes; a more detailed refutation of the extreme of
concocting things; and how here the distinction between the literal and
figurative teachings of Lord Buddha is drawn.

DANG PO LA GSUM, BYANG SA NAS BSHAD PA'I TSUL DANG , BSDU BA NAS BSHAD PA'I TSUL DANG , DE DAG LAS GZHAN PA'I GZHUNG NAS BSHAD TSUL LO, , DANG PO LA GNYIS, SGRO SKUR DU LTA BA'I TSUL DANG , DE GNYIS 'GOG PA'I TSUL LO, ,
The first of these has three further sections: the way in which the Levels of the
Bodhisattva explains the point; the way in which the Compendium explains the
point; and how other texts explain it. The first of these has two parts of its
own: how a person who is concocting or discounting things views things, and
how we refute them.

DANG PO NI, BYANG SA LAS, JI LTAR YOD CE NA YOD PA MA YIN PA LA SGRO BTAGS PA'I LEGS PAR MA ZIN PA SPANGS PA DANG YANG DAG PA LA SKUR PA BTAB PA'I LEGS PAR MA ZIN PA SPANGS PA YOD DO, ZHES SGRO SKUR SPANGS PA'I TSUL GYIS YOD DO ZHES GSUNGS PA'I SGRO 'DOGS DANG SKUR 'DEBS NI JI LTA BU ZHIG YIN ZHE NA,
Here is the first of these two parts. One may begin with the following
question:
The Levels of the Bodhisattva makes the following statement:
How then do things exist? They exist in a certain
way--in which they are free of the object of a
mistaken tendency to concoct things, a tendency
directed at something which doesn't in reality exist;
and in which they are free of the object of a
mistaken tendency to discount things, a tendency
directed at things which are in reality pure.

Can you explain what "concocting things" and "discounting
things" mean in this description that things exist in a way free of
concocting and discounting?

DE GNYIS NI BYANG SA LAS, GZUGS LA SOGS PA'I CHOS RNAMS DANG GZUGS LA SOGS PA'I DNGOS PO LA 'DOGS PA'I TSIG GI NGO BO NYID KYI RANG GI MTSAN NYID YOD PA MA YIN PA LA SGRO BTAGS NAS MNGON PAR ZHEN PA GANG YIN PA DANG , ZHES PA 'DIS SGRO 'DOGS TSUL GSUNGS LA,
These two are explained in the Levels of the Bodhisattva as follows.
The way in which concocting things works was spoken to be like
this: it is that belief in which you concoct something about the
very nature of the words that are used to make constructions
concerning physical matter and all other existing objects, and
concerning physical matter and all other functioning things;
about words that are, in fact, things which do not exist by
definition.

BTAGS PA'I TSIG GI MTSAN MA'I GZHI BTAGS PA'I TSIG GI MTSAN MA'I RTEN DU GYUR PA, BRJOD DU MED PA'I BDAG NYID KYIS DON DAM PAR YOD PA YANG DAG PA'I DNGOS PO LA THAMS CAD KYI THAMS CAD DU MED DO ZHES SKUR BA 'DEBS SHING CHUD GZON PAR BYED PA GANG YIN PA 'DI GNYIS NI CHOS 'DUL BA 'DI LAS RAB TU NYAMS PA YIN PAR RIG PAR BYA'O, , ZHES PA SNGA MAS NI SKUR PA 'DEBS TSUL BSTAN LA CHUD GZON ZHES PA MAN CHAD KYIS NI THEG PA CHEN PO'I CHOS ZAB MO LAS NYAMS PAR BSTAN NO, ,
Discounting things is like this; it is saying that the following do
not, all in all, exist:
that which is the foundation, with the typical
features, of the words used to make
constructs--that which provides the basis, with the
characteristics, of the words used to make
constructs;

that which exists ultimately, through an identity
beyond all expression; and
that which is a pure, functioning thing.
They are, in short, things that waste one's opportunity; you
should understand that these two will cause you to fall from this
spiritual way of discipline.
The beginning part of this second section constitutes a description of what it
is to discount something; and the part including the words "waste one's
opportunity" on down is describing how a person would then fall from the
profound teaching of the greater way.

GZUGS ZHES PA NAS DNGOS PO LA ZHES PA'I BAR GYIS KUN BRTAGS 'DOGS PA'I GZHI BSTAN TE, DE LA 'DOGS PA'I TSIG GI NGO BO NYID CES PA NI TSIG GIS BTAGS PA'I NGO BO NYID LA BYA'I, 'DOGS BYED KYI TSIG LA MI BYA STE BSDU BA LA SOGS PA NAS GSAL BAR BSHAD DO, , BYANG SA'I SKABS GZHAN DU BYUNG BA RNAMS KYANG DE LTAR SHES PAR BYA'O, ,
The part that talks about "physical matter," continuing down to "functional
things," is describing the object towards which a construct is directed. The part
about "the very nature of the words that are used to make constructions"
should be understood as referring to the nature [or attribute] of constructs,
rather than to the words used in applying the constructs themselves; this point
is made quite clear in works like the Compendium. You should keep in mind
that--when this phrasing is used elsewhere in the Compendium as well--it
should be read this same way.

TSIG GIS BTAGS PA'I NGO BO DE NYID RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYIS YOD PA MIN PA LA DE'I RANG GI MTSAN NYID YOD DO ZHES ZHEN PA NI SGRO 'DOGS SO, ,
The act of concocting things then consists of a believing that this nature
constructed through the use of words--something which in fact does not exist
by definition--does exist by definition.

BTAGS PA'I TSIG GI MTSAN MA'I GZHI NI BTAGS PA'I TSIG GI MTSAN MA'I RTEN ZHES 
PAS BSHAD DE KUN BRTAGS KYI GDAGS GZHI'O, ,
The expression "that which is the foundation, with the typical features, of the
words used to make constructs" is explained by the expression "that which
provides the basis, with the typical features, of the words used to make
constructs": the point is that we are talking about the object towards which the
construct is directed.

DE NYID BRJOD DU MED PA'I TSUL KYI DON DAM PAR YOD PA LA THAMS CAD KYI THAMS CAD DU MED DO ZHES 'DZIN PA NI SKUR 'DEBS SO, ,
And the act of discounting things then consists of holding the idea that this
thing--which "exists ultimately," in a way which is "beyond all
expression"--"does not, all in all, exist."

DE LTAR BYAS NA KUN BRTAGS DON DAM PAR YOD DO, , ZHES PA NI SGRO 'DOGS DANG NGO BO NYID GZHAN GNYIS DON DAM PAR MED DO ZHES PA NI SKUR 'DEBS YIN TE, DANG PO KUN RDZOB DANG GZHAN GNYIS DON DAM PAR YOD PA'I PHYIR RO, ,
Given all this, concocting things is where you say, "Constructs exist ultimately";
and discounting things is something where you say, "The other two natures do
not exist ultimately." This is because the first of the three actually only exists
deceptively, whereas the other two exist ultimately.

DON DAM PAR YOD PA LA MED PAR LTA BSKUR 'DEBS SU BSHAD PA'I ZLAS DRANGS NA DON DAM PAR MED PA LA YOD PAR LTA BA SGRO 'DOGS SU BSHAD DGOS LA SKABS 'DIR KUN BRTAGS RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYIS YOD PAR 'DZIN PA LA SGRO 'DOGS SU GSUNGS KYIS DE DON DAM PAR YOD PAR 'DZIN PA TSIG GIS GSAL BAR MA BSTAN KYANG RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYIS YOD NA DON DAM PAR YOD PA GZHUNG GI DON YIN PAS KUN BRTAGS DON DAM PAR YOD PA SGRO 'DOGS SU 'GRO BA'I PHYOGS SO, ,
If we explain discounting things as being the view that something which in
actuality does exist ultimately doesn't exist at all, then it would seem that we'd
have to explain concocting things as being the converse; that is, as the view
that something which in actuality does not exist ultimately, does exist. The
position stated at this point though is that concocting things consists of holding
that constructs exist by definition--which means holding them to exist
ultimately. So although it's not stated clearly in the actual wording, the point
of the text here is that--if something exists by definition--then it exists
ultimately. Holding that constructs exist ultimately then, according to this
view, constitutes the act of concocting things.
On the Meaning of "Ultimate" and "Deceptive" Reality

GNYIS PA LA GNYIS, PHYOGS SNGA MA DGOD CING DE'I DON LA DRIS LAN BYA BA DANG , LAN BTAB PA'I PHYOGS DGAG PA'O, ,
Here next is how the Compendium explains the point of how to avoid the two
extremes. We proceed in three steps: a presentation of the opponent position,
some questions and answers concerning this position, and a refutation of these
answers.

DANG PO NI, BSDU BA LAS, THEG PA CHEN PO PA LA LA RANG GIS NYES PAR BZUNG BAS 'DI SKAD CES KUN RDZOB TU NI THAMS CAD YOD LA DON DAM PAR NI THAMS CAD MED DO ZHES ZER RO, , ZHES GSUNGS TE, CHOS KUN DON DAM PAR NI MED LA THA SNYAD DU YOD PA'O ZHES SMRA BA'I DBU MA PA RNAMS KYIS CHOS RNAMS KYI YOD MED KYI KHYAD PAR PHYE BA BRJOD PA'O, ,
Here is the first. The Compendium includes a section that says:
Some followers of the greater way, intent on continuing to hold
to their errors, make this claim:
In a deceptive way, it is true that all things exist.
Ultimately though nothing exists.
These are the followers of the Middle Way, who speak of some
distinction between different ways in which all things both do
exist and don't exist, saying, "No single existing thing exists
ultimately; and every one of them does exist nominally."

DE NAS DE LA 'DI SKAD CES TSE DANG LDAN PA DON DAM PA NI GANG YIN KUN RDZOB NI GANG YIN ZHES BRJOD PAR BYA'O, ,
And when they say this we reply to them with the following
question:
Then we ask you, venerable sirs, what does it mean
to be "ultimate"? And what does it mean to be
"deceptive"?

DE SKAD DRIS PA NA GAL TE 'DI SKAD CES CHOS THAMS CAD KYI NGO BO NYID MED PA GANG YIN PA DE NI DON DAM PA YIN LA, NGO BO NYID MED PA'I CHOS DE DAG LA NGO BO NYID DU DMIGS PA GANG YIN PA DE NI KUN RDZOB YIN NO, ,
And suppose they answer like this--
"Ultimate" refers to that thing which is the lack of
a self-nature that every existing object exhibits.
"Deceptive" refers to that thing which is the
tendency to see all these objects--which in truth
have no nature of their own--as having some
nature of their own.

And why is that? Because this tendency focuses on
things that don't even exist and creates a deception,
and makes up something, and declares something
to be, and creates an expression.
This would describe how our opponents would answer if you
asked them what the two truths were.

Here the question that is posed--"What does 'ultimate' mean?"--is one in
which we are asking for a typical example of ultimate truth. It is not though
a question about the "ultimate" that we say doesn't exist when we say that
nothing existing ultimately; not a question about how something isn't. If it
were, then it would be a mistake to answer that "ultimate" referred to the fact
that no existing thing has a self-nature; and this is because, when those of the
Middle Way say that something exists "as the ultimate," meaning "as the lack
of self-existence exhibited by all things," this is not at all what they mean when
they talk about something that could exist ultimately.

The question about "What does it mean to be 'deceptive'?" is as well a question
about the state of mind to which something can be established as what we call
"deceptive truth"; it is not a question about the "nominal" we speak of when
we say that things exist "nominally." If it were, then it would be incorrect to
speak of the "deceptive" where you hold that things have some nature of their
own when--in fact--they have no such nature. Remember, this is the
tendency to hold things as being true: and those of the Middle Way would say
that the thing it believes in doesn't even have any nominal existence. And this
is because, when you speak of things "not having any self-nature," the self-

nature that you say things don't have has to be referring to a kind of self-
nature which is absent: to a self-nature that existed truly.
Interpretations of the Independent Group
of the Middle-Way School
There is no one section of Je Tsongkapa's root text on the Essence of Eloquence that
easily presents all the concepts of the Independent group of the Middle-Way School on
the subjects covered in the course so far. We therefore begin a group of selections,
many from monastic textbooks, which together give us a good overview of the relevant
ideas.
The first part of the reading helps understand the differences between the Independent
group, the Mind-Only School, and the Consequence group on the question of whether
things exist from their own sides, with their own unique identities. The selection is
taken from the Overview of the Perfection of Wisdom (Phar-phyin spyi-don) of
Master Kedrup Tenpa Dargye (1493-1568), from the glorious Sera Mey Tibetan
Monastery (ACIP electronic text catalog number SL0009, Part One, folios 12a-13b).
Remember that most of the descriptions of "our own system" refer to that of the
Independent group!

Therefore the following is the final form of the idea denied by the reasoning
which examines the ultimate:
Anything which existed from its own side with its own unique
identity, rather than being simply established as existing by
appearing to an unaffected state of mind.

And this is true because the final form of the way in which physical matter
and all other existing objects exist deceptively is through their being
established as existing by a state of mind which is unaffected by short-term
circumstances that would cause it to make an error.

GZUGS SOGS KYI CHOS RNAMS 'JOG BYED KYI BLO DE 'PHRAL GYI 'KHRUL RGYUS MA BSLAD PA DGOS SHING PHUGS KYI 'KHRUL RGYUS MA BSLAD PA NI MI DGOS TE,
When we describe the state of mind which can establish that physical matter
and all other existing objects exist, it is necessarily one which is not affected by
some short-term circumstances which would cause it to make an error; it is not
the case though that it would have to be a state of mind which was not
affected by some long-term circumstances.

And this is because it is not the case that--when physical matter and other
such existing objects appear to be things that exist by definition--this
appearance is not something which is affected neither by short-term nor by
long-term circumstances; and because it involves being affected by the innate
form of the tendency to hold things as existing truly.

Here we will explain how this school decides what the two realities are, using
some metaphors as well. Two things have to be present with all of these
objects: with physical matter and every other existing thing. From the point
of view of what appears in the world, they must be established as existing

from our side--merely by virtue of their appearing to an unaffected state of
mind. From the point of view of emptiness, they must be void of any kind of
existence where the object exists from its own side through its own unique
identity, rather than by virtue of its appearing to an unaffected state of mind.

And so two things have to come together for a functional thing like a sprout:
it must be established as existing by virtue of appearing to an unaffected state
of mind; and the sprout should exist from its own side through some identity.
 DANG PO DGOS TE, DE MI DGOS NA, MYU GU LA MYU GU ZHES PA'I MING MA THOGS PA'I GANG ZAG GI NGOR YANG , MYU GU MYU GUR GRUB DGOS PA'I PHYIR,
The first is necessary since--if it were not--then a sprout would have to be a
sprout even to a person who had never been introduced to the idea that the
sprout was called a "sprout."

PHYI MA DGOS TE, DE MI DGOS NA, RI BONG GI RVA ZHES PA'I MING GIS BZHAG PA TZAM DANG , RI BONG GI RVA ZHES RTOG PAS BZUNG BA TZAM DANG MTSUNGS PAR 'GYUR BA'I PHYIR,
The latter is necessary since--if it were not--then a sprout would be a sprout
in exactly the same way as the horn of a rabbit is the horn of a rabbit: merely
because we called it the "horn of a rabbit," or just because we imagined
something called the "horn of a rabbit."

Consider, by the way, the word "merely" when we speak of physical matter
and all other existing objects as being "things which are established as existing
merely by virtue of their appearing to an unaffected state of mind." Its use is

meant to disallow the idea that these things could be established by virtue of
some unique identity of the object itself, rather than being established as
existing by virtue of this appearing. It is not however meant to disallow the
idea that things do not exist merely through names and terms.

And this is true because, as the Perfect Explanation, an Illumination of the True
Thought, has a part where it states--
Given the fact that those who belong to this school accept the
idea that physical matter and all other existing objects do possess
an identity that is not established merely through names and

Now there is a metaphor which we can use for the idea that physical matter
and all other existing objects are established as existing from our side--merely
by virtue of their appearing to an unaffected state of mind, and for the idea
that these objects exist through some identity of their own.

Think of a case where a magician makes a stick of wood appear as a horse or
cow. Two things have to be present here. First of all, the appearance of a
horse or cow there around the stick is something that is established as existing
by virtue of the minds of the people whose eyes are affected by the magic
words and powder, from their side. Secondly, an appearance must also be
something coming from the side of the stick.

The first requirement, being established as existing by virtue of the minds of
the people whose eyes are affected by the magic words and powder, is
necessary since--if it were not--then those in the audience whose eyes were
not affected by the magic words and powder would have to see this
appearance, whereas they do not.

In this same situation it is also necessary for the horse or cow to be appearing
from the stick's side as well, since--if they were not--then the appearance of
a horse or cow would have to occur even in a place where there were no stick;
whereas it does not.

Physical matter--and all other existing objects--are similar, in that they are
established as existing by an unaffected state of mind; and this is because they
are constructed by virtue of an unaffected state of mind and names that fit.

They do not, however, exist from their own side through some unique identity
of their own, without being established as existing by virtue of appearing to
an unaffected state of mind. This is because--if they were to exist this
way--then they would have to be some ultimate nature. And if they were
some ultimate nature, then they would have to be something which is
perceived directly by a certain unmistaken state of mind: that meditative
wisdom of a realized being who is not yet a Buddha, and who perceives the
real nature of things directly. The fact is though that they are not.

In this situation, where a magician makes a stick appear as a horse or cow, two
things apply to the members of the audience whose eyes are affected by the
magic words and powder: they stick is appearing as a horse or cow, and they
believe that it is.

The only condition that applies to the magician himself is that a horse or cow
is appearing to him; he does not believe in them. And those members of the
audience who showed up later--those whose eyes were not affected by the
magic words or powder--have neither the horse or cow appearing to them, nor
any belief in the horse or cow. These same three different permutations apply
as well to physical matter and all the other existing objects.

STONG NYID RTOGS MA MYONG BA'I SO SO SKYE BO RNAMS LA, GZUGS SOGS KYI CHOS RNAMS BDEN GRUB TU SNANG BA DANG ZHEN PA GNYIS KA YOD,
Consider "common" people: those who have not yet had their first experience
of the perception of emptiness. Both situations apply to them for physical
matter and all other existing objects: these things appear to them to exist truly,
and they believe in the way they appear.

Consider now bodhisattvas who have reached one of the pure levels. Even
though objects appear to their minds, during what we call the "subsequent
period," as something which exists truly, they have no belief in them this way.
And this is because neither situation applies to realized beings who are not yet
Buddhas and who are perceiving the real nature of things directly; that is,
physical matter and other objects do not appear to them as if they existed
truly, and they do not believe that these objects exist that way.

The Consequence and Independent groups of the Middle-Way School hold the
same belief about the following things; both schools hold them to be what is
denied by the reasoning which examines the ultimate:
a thing that could exist truly;
a thing that could exist purely;
a thing that could exist as thusness;
a thing that could exist ultimately; and
the thought where you hold that anything could exist
in any of these ways.

The Independent group does not however agree that the following are what
is denied by the reasoning which examines the ultimate:
a thing that existed from its own side;
a thing that existed by nature;
a thing that existed as a substantial thing;
a thing that existed by definition; and
the thought where you hold that anything like physical matter or the
rest could exist this way.

And this is true because they believe that--if something exists--it must
necessarily exist as the three left over after you exclude a thing that existed as
a substantial thing. There is some discussion about the status of constructs; but
they believe that, if something is a functional thing, it must exist as a
substantial thing.

Neither those who follow the Consequence system, nor those who follow the
Independent system, accept that any of the following could be the final form
of the idea denied by the reasoning which examines the ultimate:
a thing that existed as the way things really are;
a thing that existed as ultimate reality; and
a thing that existed as the real nature of things.

DON DAM BDEN PA YIN NA DE GSUM DU GRUB PAS KHYAB PA'I PHYIR TE,
And this is true because--if something is ultimate reality--it must always exist
as these three as well.

And this is true first of all because the Perfect Explanation, an Illumination of the
True Thought, states that--when the commentary to the Sixty Verses of Reasoning
describes nirvana as deceptive reality--what it means is that nirvana must be
established as existing as ultimate reality with reference to a deceived state of
mind. Distinguishing between the Figurative and the Literal also states that the
real nature of things exists as the real nature of things; and Opening the Eyes of
the Good and Fortune states that it doesn't automatically mean that something
exists ultimately just because it exists as the real nature of things.

It would be correct to say then that there is a difference in subtlety between the
Consequence and Independent versions of the final form of the idea denied by
the reasoning which examines the ultimate. This is true first of all because the
Independent group accepts the concept that things can exist by definition,
through their accepting the concepts of an independent logical reason; of
something that could grow from something other than itself; and of something
that could exist as a substantial thing.

The idea is moreover supported by the manner in which the schools explain
the concept of what is literal and what is figurative. Master Bhavaviveka
denies extensively the idea that the Mind-Only School explains the true intent
of the middle turning of the wheel to be the concept that constructs do not
exist by definition. And when Shantarakshita and his spiritual son explain the
way in which the final turning of the wheel comments upon the middle
turning, they explain it as meaning that constructs do not exist by definition
in an ultimate way, but do exist by definition in a nominal way.
************
The following selection is drawn from the same text, the Overview of the Perfection
of Wisdom (Part Five, ff. 9a-10a). It gives an idea of how valid the Consequence
group considers the division of selflessness into three differing degrees of subtlety:

The Consequence group of the Middle-Way School draws a distinction between
the lack of a self-nature of persons and of things, but only relative to the thing
it is which is empty of them; they do not however make any distinction
between more or less subtle versions of what it is we deny by the reasoning
which examines the ultimate. Here in the Independent School though they
recognize both these distinctions.

And it is relative to this fact that they can say it's not necessarily the case that
something is devoid of existing as a self-standing, substantial object if it
exhibits the qualities of growing and stopping. They would also say that, just
because something is a person, it's not necessarily the case that it is then
devoid of this same kind of existence. And this is because both are disproved
by the example of consciousness of the thought.

Here is the first.
Consider the heaps that we have taken on.

If something exhibits the qualities of growing and
stopping, it cannot be something which exists as a
self-standing, substantial object;
Because if something were the self-nature of a person it
could never be something which exhibited the
qualities of growing and stopping.
And this is true because, if something were this kind of a
self-nature, it would have to be something which
were unchanging, singular, and independent.

Consider the fresh, unerring state of mind which grows from this type of
reasoning, and which perceives a kind of emptiness which is the fact that the
person is devoid of being a self-standing, substantial object. This is a deductive
form of valid perception which has realized the lack of a self-nature to the
person, and we describe it as being a realization of an emptiness which has
grown from contemplation.

The next selection is also taken from the Overview (Part Five, f. 3b), and gives an
insight into how the Independent group views the function of meditating upon the

"Well then," you may think to yourself, "how do we in our own position
describe the process by which one eliminates the various impurities?" It has
been taught that:
One can gain the ability to put a total end to the three--that is,
to the obstacles of the mental afflictions, to the gross obstacles to
omniscience, and to the subtle obstacles to omniscience--if one
meditates with that wisdom which grows from meditation and
which sees directly the three degrees of the lack of a self-nature;
this itself grows from following the practices of study and
meditation to come to an understanding of these three.
Given this statement, it is not the case that in our own position we believe--as
do those who assert the existence of functional things which exist truly--that
one can eliminate impurities that one asserts exist in truth. The citation rather
is demonstrating the principal tenet of how our own system describes the
process of eliminating the two obstacles; that is, that we eliminate impurities
by meditating upon how these same impurities lack any true existence.
************
We turn next to comments on whether the lower degrees of selflessness are true
emptiness; these are taken from "The Cloud of Offerings, which Pleases the Wise,
and Illuminates the True Thought of the Treatise known as the 'Ornament of
Realizations,'" being a Combined Word Commentary and Dialectical Analysis
of the Fifth Chapter of the Treatise. This work was composed by Choney Lama

Suppose someone comes and makes the following claim:
It must too be the case that the uninterrupted path in the mind
of a person at the end of the process realizes, directly, the
form of emptiness which is the absence of a separate
substance to physical matter and the valid perception
which perceives this physical matter,
Because it perceives this fact directly in a single briefest instant of
action.

DER THAL, DES DE DE LTAR RTOGS NUS PA'I PHYIR, ZER NA, MA KHYAB,
[We disagree with your reason.]
But you can't, because it does have the capacity to do so.
Our answer would be that it doesn't necessarily follow.

And one could never agree with your position, because we are talking about

But it does necessarily follow, because that emptiness represented by the
absence of a separate substance to physical matter and the valid perception
which perceives this physical matter is deceptive reality.
Interpretations of the Consequence Group,
and What Je Tsongkapa Himself Believes
The following selection gives a brief but exquisite description of how the concept of
emptiness is explained by followers of the Consequence group of the Middle-Way
School of Buddhism (the Madhyamika Prasangika). It is taken from the Overview of

the Middle Way (dBu-ma spyi-don) by Kedrup Tenpa Dargye (1493-1568), an
eminent author of textbooks for Sera Mey Tibetan Monastery (ACIP electronic text
number S0021, ff. 125a-130a).

Here we will analyze the statement [from Entering the Middle Way, by Master
Chandrakirti (650 AD)] where it says, "...The mind of a craving spirit as well,
which sees a stream of water as pus." One may begin with the following
question:
Let's consider the objects of the following states of mind: the
visual consciousness of a craving spirit where a river of water
looks like pus and blood; the visual consciousness of a person
with a kind of cataract where a clean white porcelain basin looks
like a hair has fallen into it; and that kind of meditation where
you visualize skeletons--where you imagine that the entire
surface of the earth is covered with the bones of corpses. Are all
these objects completely equivalent, as far as being something
that exists or doesn't exist?

In reply we will first set forth a relevant passage, and then we will explain the
passage. Here is the first. The text called The Abbreviation of the Greater Way
says,

Insofar as craving spirits, animals,
Humans, and pleasure beings, each according
To their class, have differing perceptions
Of a single thing, we say it has no reality.
Asvabhava, the holy layman with lifetime vows, has explained the passage.
His words include the following:
When they look at a single thing, a stream of water, each one sees
what the ripening of his particular karma forces him to see. A
craving spirit sees the river full of pus and blood and the like.

DE NYID LA DUD 'GRO LA SOGS PAS GNAS KYI BLOS GNAS PAR BYED PA DANG ,
An animal or such, on the other hand, thinks of this same water
as a place to stay, and makes his home there.

Humans look at the same thing and perceive it as water--sweet,

and they swim in it.

Those pleasure beings who are wrapped in deep meditation at
the level we call the "realm of limitless space" see the water as
empty space, for their ability to conceptualize physical matter has
dissolved altogether.

Here secondly is the section where we establish our own position. Now
suppose three different types of beings--a pleasure being, a human, and a
craving spirit, each with their own karma--sit down together and look upon
a glass filled with water, the thing we define as "wet and flowing." The glass
of water is not at this point one thing which is simultaneously three different
objects. Neither is it necessary in this situation for there to be three identical
valid perceptions. And when the glass full of wet and flowing water occurs,
it occurs with three different, distinct parts to it.
[Translator's note: When the phrase "wet and flowing" (the definition of the element
of water) is used here, it should be understood as emphasizing the more general
concept of a liquid, rather than the water which the human perceives.]

It is not though the case that, from the time it first started, the glass of water
came with the three different parts, or that they stay with the glass of water
until it eventually ends. What happens is that one of the parts of the glass
filled with wet and flowing water provides a material cause, and the karma of
the craving spirit provides a contributing factor; and then based on both of
these the later continuation of one part of the glass of water starts being blood
and pus.

DE'I CHA SHAS GCIG GIS NYER LEN DANG , MI'I LAS KYIS LHAN CIG BYED RKYEN BYAS PA LA BRTEN NAS DE'I CHA SHAS GCIG GI RIGS 'DRA PHYI MA CHUR SKYE BA DANG ,
Another part of the glass of water again provides a material cause, and the
karma of the human provides a contributing factor; and then based on both of
these the later continuation of one part of the glass of water starts being water.

Yet another part of the glass of water provides a material cause, and the karma
of the pleasure being provides a contributing factor; and then based on both
of these the later continuation of one part of the glass of water starts being
ambrosia, and so on.

At this point, the glass full of wet and flowing water is something with three
different parts. Nonetheless, it is not the case that all three different beings see
all three parts. The craving spirit is forced by the bad karma he has collected
to see the glass of water as pus and blood; and he doesn't see the other two
things. One should understand that a similar case holds with the latter two
types of beings.

What we just described as happening is only with reference to where a glass
of something wet and flowing is an object shared by the three different beings,
as they look at it together. When the craving spirit himself though picks up
the glass in his hand and begins to partake of its contents, the glass of liquid
is no longer something that exists with three different parts. Since at this point
it is something that the craving spirit is experiencing exclusively, its
continuation starts being pus and blood.

How the glass of liquid exists originally all depends on the particular outer
world from where it has been taken, for each of the three different beings has
a different outer world, depending on the specific karma he himself has
collected. If the glass of liquid were sweet, cool water taken from the world
of humans--a world created by the specific karma of the human in the
group--then that would be its original condition, and so on.

When we say that a craving spirit looks at a stream of water and sees pus and
blood, by the way, we are only talking about some kinds of craving spirits, and
not all of them. This is because there are many kinds of craving spirits: some
with obstacles in the world around them that prevent them from relieving their
craving; some with obstacles that are parts of their bodies; and some with
obstacles that relate to the food or drink itself.

There is, moreover, an example we can use for how, when the three different
types of beings with their three karmas look all together at a glass full of
something wet and flowing, there start to be three different objects, each
confirmed by a valid perception. Suppose there is a ball of red-hot steel; one
piece of this ball provides the material cause, and the "mantra of steel"
provides a contributing factor. Due to these two, a person who has used the
mantra of steel on his hand can touch the ball, but he doesn't undergo any
sensation of heat; instead, he feels some other sensation. A person who has
not used the mantra on his hand touches the ball and does feel a sensation of
heat, and no other kind of sensation.

Another example would be the moon in springtime; one part of the feel of its
rays on the body provides the material cause, and then the karma of a craving
spirit provides a contributing factor. Based on these two, the spirit gets a
sensation of heat, which is experienced by the consciousness of the body.
So too with the wintertime sun; one part of the feel of its rays on the body
provides the material cause, and then the karma of the craving spirit provides
a contributing factor. Based on these two, the spirit gets a sensation cold,
which is experienced by the consciousness of the body.

DE LTAR SKYE BA YIN TE, BSHES SPRING LAS,  YI DVAGS RNAMS LA SOS KA'I DUS SU NI, , ZLA BA'ANG TSA LA DGUN NI NYI MA'ANG GRANG , ZHES GSUNGS PA'I PHYIR,
It is a fact that they get this kind of sensation, for [Arya Nagarjuna's] Letter to
a Friend states:
For craving spirits, even the light of the moon
In the spring is hot, and even the winter sun cold.

All of this is caused by the extraordinary circumstances of the particular time
and place, for generally speaking it never happens this way: there is nothing
at all about the sun that can feel cold, and nothing about the moon that can
feel hot. This too is a fact, for there does not exist on the sun any case of that
substance we call "covered space."

In conclusion now, let us consider again these three kinds of beings, each with
their different karma, as they sit down together and look at a glass full of
something wet and flowing. It's not necessarily true that they must all have
valid perceptions which are identical. If they did, then the three beings
looking at the glass of water would have to think of the water as a place to
live, in the way that a creature living in water would. The three beings as well
would have to see the water in the same way that microscopic organisms
living in the water, little beings imperceptible to normal visual consciousness,
see it with their own visual consciousness. Then too the visual consciousness
of microscopic organisms living in the depths of the ocean would have to be
a valid perception towards the entire extent of the sea. And certain kinds of
near-gods too would have to see weapons as glasses of water, and on and on;
the problems raised would be many.

Again consider this same situation. Even though it is not necessarily true that
the valid perceptions are identical, it is possible for there to be three valid
perceptions here which happen to be identical. This is because, as we have
already established logically, there can be a case where by the force of karma
three different objects, each one confirmed by a valid perception, start to exist.
And since this is possible, then it is equally possible that, by the force of
karma, three equivalent valid perceptions of a vessel could start to exist as
well.

When the text of the Essence of Eloquence was taught by Geshe Tupten Rinchen,
he took great pains to point out that it is not correct--as some Western scholars have
stated--that Je Tsongkapa himself adhered to the tenets of the Mind-Only School. The
following selection to show that he follows, of course, the beliefs of the Consequence
group is taken the concluding pages of our root text [ACIP electronic text S5396, ff.

Now suppose you come and ask the following:
We have a question for you. You have shown us how the
systems of the two great innovators make the distinction between
those parts of the highest of all spoken words which are
figurative, and those which are literal. And there are a great
variety of ways in which the different kings of all great thinkers
have commented upon the true intent of these two. Tell us
now--which of these master commentators do you follow; how
is it that you yourself decide on what is literal, and what is it that
you believe is the ultimate?

We answer with the following lines:
I can't deny that I feel respect from the bottom of my

For all the fine words ever taught by the jewels among this

The reasoning though of dependence, invariable, for the

And when this pure white light of the Moon,* this
excellent explanation,
Has opened wide the night-blooming lotus, the eyes of the
intellect,
And we finally see that path set before us by
Buddhapalita,
Who then would fail to hold as their core Nagarjuna's
excellent way?

Chandrakirti.]

And so--in the context of the way of the perfections--it is the systems of the
two great innovators that have spread widely; systems by which, in the ways
we have described above, the meaning of that highest of spoken words is
divided into the literal and the figurative, to determine what thusness really
is. But it is also the case that those wise men who have commented upon the
great works of the way of the secret word, and the eminent practitioners of this
way, have set forth the meaning of thusness in keeping with one or the other
of these very two systems; there is no third system between the two. You
should understand then that this method is the path for determining the
meaning of thusness for each and every one of the works of the highest of
speech, whether we are talking of the open or the secret teachings.

And so imagine a person who tried to find the meaning of thusness without
relying on a system taught by one of the great innovators of the two methods.
They would be like a blind person without a guide for the blind, racing
towards some very dangerous place.

And suppose that a person did want to rely on one of these systems, but had
not spent a good deal of time acquanting themselves with their great books.
Suppose, in particular, that they were relying only on a few short descriptions
to determine the difference between those teachings of the Buddha which were
figurative, and those which were literal--without having a proper
understanding of the subtle, crucial points of reasoning involved. People like
this would be taking refuge in words only; and even if they were to attempt
to talk about thusness, it would be only words, without any essence.

Try to see how this is true, and never be satisfied with seeing even some great
number of the more obvious crucial points on these questions. Make the effort
to acquaint yourself well with both the gross and more subtle keys of
reasoning that the two great innovators have given us as eyes to see into the
Buddha's teaching. And then let your labors continue to flow, like some great
stream, coming to an understanding of the profound points of the far-reaching
traditions, and the profound traditions, and the more-profound-than-profound
traditions, in the teachings of the Buddha.

Take then lastly whatever you have understood and make it the very heart of
your own personal spiritual practice: it is for the likes of you, for those of
intelligence who hope to see the teachings of the Victorious Ones remain long
in our world, that I have set down into words this Essence of Eloquence.
