Course X: Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life, Part I
Reading One: Author, Structure, and History of the Text
The following story recounts in brief some of the events in the life of the great
bodhisattva Shantideva. It is a paraphrase of sections from the Life Stories of
the Lineage Teachers of the Steps of the Path (Lam-rim bla-ma brgyud-pa'i rnam-thar)
written by Yongdzin Yeshe Gyeltsen (1713-1793), the teacher of the eighth Dalai
Lama.
**********
Master Shantideva was born to the west of Bodhgaya, the Seat of the Diamond,
in a place called Yulkor Mosang. His father was a king named Armor of
Virtue, and his mother was said to be an emanation of Vajra Yogini, the Angel
of Diamond. He was able to choose the details of his birth, and when he was
born he was given the name Armor of Peace. In his childhood he had all the
favorable conditions that he needed, and from his earliest age he revealed
himself to be a master of the traditional philosophical and other sciences.
When he was six years old he met a great practitioner of the secret teachings,
and received an initiation and a practice for reaching the enlightened being
named Manjushri, or Gentle Voice. As a child he made great efforts in this
practice, doing its meditations and reciting its secret words, and was soon able
to meet Gentle Voice himself. After meeting this holy being, Master
Shantideva was able to receive many teachings from him directly.
When his father the King passed away, all the people of the land requested
Prince Shantideva to be King. Because he had practiced the bodhisattva path
in many previous lives, he had no desire to live a life of royalty, but so as not
to upset the people he agreed. The night before his crowning ceremony
though he had a dream. In the dream he saw Gentle Voice sitting on the
King's throne, and He said, "Son, this is my seat and I am your Teacher. It
would be improper for us to sit on the same seat." Upon waking he realized
that it was wrong for him to enjoy the pleasures of owning a kingdom, and he
ran away.

Master Shantideva first went to Nalandra Monastery where he met the
supreme leader of all the learned scholars there. His name was Angel of
Virtue, and from this teacher he took the commitment to leave the home life.
It also was from this master that he received the name Shantideva, which
means "Angel of Peace." At the monastery he served his preceptor well,
studied the three collections of scripture, and became a great scholar. He
continued to receive many teachings from Gentle Voice himself, and was able
to grasp the meaning of all the Buddha's teachings, both open and secret. He
eliminated all the different kinds of distraction, both inner and outer, and with
this incredible focus of mind he reached a very high spiritual level. He then
composed the works entitled the Compendium of Trainings, the Compendium of
the Sutras, and other books which describe the amazingly powerful and
effective way of the life of a bodhisattva. Master Shantideva perfected within
himself the three characteristics of a great Buddhist master--teaching, debating,
and writing--and continued to rise up all the spiritual levels and paths. He
achieved the ability to remember everything he had ever been taught, the
ability to perform miracles effortlessly, and incredible clairvoyance; thus he
became a god among bodhisattvas.
This was his inner life, but to the eyes of impure people Shantideva seemed to
be interested in only three things: eating, sleeping, and going to the toilet. He
thus became known by the name Bhusuku, which means "Mister Three
Thoughts." Because the only fitting activity for a man who has left the home
life is to involve himself in teaching, some of the monks who could not see
who he really was perceived Master Shantideva as someone who was just
living off the kindness of the laypeople, and decided that they should expel
him from the monastery. They asked him to recite a scripture from memory
before a gathering of the monastery, hoping that their request would cause him
to decide to leave on his own. He answered them by saying, "How could
someone like me ever be able to recite scripture?" and declined. However
they insisted that he do so, and eventually he agreed.
The entire monastery was then invited to this gathering, and a very high
throne was set up, one without any stairs--so there was no way for anyone to
climb atop it. But when the bodhisattva Shantideva reached the front of the
throne, he touched it gently, and without the slightest effort he appeared
sitting on top of it. He then asked and said, "Would you like me to recite
something you have heard before, or something which you have never heard?"
The assembly asked that he recite something that they had not heard before,
and so he began to recite that book which we call the Guide to the Bodhisattva's
Way of Life. He began at the very beginning of the text, and by the time he had
gotten about a third of the way through the ninth chapter he began to rise up
into the sky. He rose higher and higher, and it seemed as though the sky and
his knowledge were pitted in competition, until he could no longer be seen at
all, only heard. Then he totally disappeared.

Later on some of the monks who had clairvoyance of the ear, and others who
were masters of total recall, pieced the whole book together. The group who
were from Kashmir said that it had nine chapters, and the group from central
India said it had ten. People then began to get curious about two of his other
books which were mentioned in the fifth chapter of the Guide, and so they sent
two monks to the place where Master Shantideva was living. They travelled
to a stupa in the south of India called Pelyun Chen to invite him to come back
to Nalandra. The master refused to come, but he did tell them that the people
from central India were correct, and that the two books they sought could be
found written in tiny letters hidden in the rafters of his old room at the
monastery. He then gave these monks a complete explanation of the both the
Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life and the Compendium of Trainings.
Later Master Shantideva was wondering what he could do to help others, and
so he decided to check with his clairvoyance. He saw in the east a great many
people whose lives were disturbed by a terrible dispute and, seeing that he
could help, set off in their direction. While he was there he acted as the
opponent of the great argument maker who was causing all the trouble, and
with his great powers he was able to bring everyone back together.
He then thought to himself, "What further could I do to benefit people?" The
idea then came to him that he should travel to the kingdom of Magada in
order to help the people living there who had fallen into the chasm of wrong
views. When he arrived, he found a great many people who had extremely
weird wrong views, and he decided to stay with them for some time. One
day, due to his extraordinary power and to the purity of the prayers these
people had made in their past lives, there occurred an enormous blizzard. The
storm lasted for seven days, and the community ran out of food and drink.
They began to go crazy, and decided that whoever was able to come up with
something to eat and drink would become their leader. The bodhisattva
Shantideva was miraculously able to fill a single alms bowl with rice, and from
it fed everybody in the community. As their leader he was then able to
demolish their wrong views, and lead them into the Buddha's teachings.
Master Shantideva next checked with his clairvoyance to see who else needed
help. He saw many people suffering from a famine, in desperate need of help,
and thousands about to die. He provided these people with sustenance, taught
them the teachings of the Buddha, and thus brought them to happiness.
Then the great bodhisattva thought to himself, "What could I do to help the
teachings of the Buddha?" He saw that if he were to assist a certain king it
would aid many people. He journeyed to the crossroads near his palace, and
began to assess the situation. He found a great crowd of mighty, but merciless
people. There were a lot of them gathered already, and many others like them
on their way. These people were aware of the king's great wealth, and this fact
was causing the king much distress. He thought that if he were to use all of

his wealth to pay off these people, then having obtained the kingdom would
be of no point; but also that if he did not, then they would surely separate his
mind from his body. Master Shantideva took a liking to the king, and arranged
to be his bodyguard. Because he had limitless power and might, he was able
to overpower all of the evil people, and put the king and his people at ease.
During all this time Master Shantideva had no weapon other than a single
wooden sword, a sword resembling the sword of Gentle Voice.
The whole kingdom began to develop great faith and respect for Master
Shantideva, and made many offerings to him. But there was one man who
was very jealous of him, and could not bear all of his success. He went to the
king and told him that Master Shantideva was a devious man. He told the
king that Shantideva had nothing more then a wooden sword, and that he
would never be able to protect him if anything happened. He said to the king,
"This man is a deceiving you. Even his sword is nothing more than wood, and
so he could never be able to guard your body"; and advised the king to
investigate. The king became angered, went to Master Shantideva, and told
him to take his sword out of its scabbard. The bodhisattva replied saying,
"Your Highness will be hurt if I do so," but the king told him to do it anyway,
whether it hurt him or not. Master Shantideva then said to him, "I agree then
to take it out, but I advise Your Highness to cover one of your eyes. The king
covered one eye as instructed, and when the great bodhisattva pulled out the
sword, it blazed with such a light that the king's exposed eye was blinded.
The King apologized, took refuge in Master Shantideva, and entered into the
teachings of the Buddha.
After this Master Shantideva thought to himself, "What next can I do to be of
help to others?" He checked with his clairvoyance, and saw there were many
non-Buddhists who opposed the Teachings and needed to be subdued. He
went to where they lived in the south, and dressed himself as a beggar. One
day a servant of the King saw him and noticed that drops of water which
touched his body instantly began to boil.
There was a non-Buddhist teacher living in this land who decided that he
wanted to compete with a Buddhist in miraculous powers. He made a deal
with the king that whoever lost this competition would have to convert to the
other's religion, and that the winner could burn all of the monasteries and
books of the loser's religion. The King could find no one of the Buddhist
community who would agree to these conditions, and he grieved. Then the
servant who had seen the miracle with Master Shantideva told him about it.
The King sent out messengers to seek him, and to beg for his help in defeating
the non-Buddhist teacher.
The bodhisattva Shantideva told them that he would be able to help, and that
they should prepare a large bowl of water, two bolts of cloth, and a fire. On
the day of the competition the whole kingdom gathered, and a throne was

prepared for the King. The two opponents began their debates, and because
of the power of Master Shantideva's reasoning and scriptural knowledge, his
opponent was unable to even respond. Because of this he thought he'd try to
win with his miraculous powers instead, and so he began to draw the secret
world of a powerful Hindu god in the sky. But before he had finished
drawing even its eastern side, the bodhisattva Shantideva went into a deep
meditation on the element of wind and brought about a great storm which
began to tear apart the entire area.
The King, Queen, and the others assembled ran for cover, and the non-
Buddhist teacher and his secret world were thrown about in every direction,
like sparrows caught in a hurricane. A great darkness descended upon all the
land, and Master Shantideva sent rays of light out from a spot between his
eyes to light the way for the King and the Queen. Their clothes had been
ripped off and they were covered in dust, so the great bodhisattva bathed them
in the water from the bowl, dressed them in the cloth, and put them near the
fire, where they could warm themselves.
Master Shantideva's activities were exclusively dedicated to the benefit of
living beings, and to helping the Buddha's teachings. Everything he did was
meant to express the truth of the saying: "Men are like the mango fruit.
Sometimes they look ripe on the outside, but are not ripe on the inside. Others
are ripe on the inside, but don't look ripe on the outside. Some look and are
ripe both inside and out, and others that don't look ripe truly are not." For
people like us who haven't seen emptiness directly, it is very difficult to judge
another's mind. Generally speaking then we should never allow ourselves to
think that anyone at all has any bad qualities, and we should realize more
specifically that criticizing anyone who has entered the Buddha's teachings is
like playing near a pit of embers concealed in ash. It is important that we not
criticize other people, and to try to see all things as pure. It is to express this
fact that Master Shantideva lived the way that he did.
He also taught us by example many other lessons. Never be satisfied with
wrong or partial paths. Train yourself in paths which are complete. Practice
what is taught in this bodhisattva's books. If you take Gentle Voice as your
personal Angel, you will be able to achieve all wonderful qualities. It isn't
fitting to put any faith in books which can't bring you to total enlightenment.
The only entry point for those who wish for freedom is the teachings of
Enlightened Beings. So if you wish to practice the teachings of the steps of the
path to enlightenment, make supplication to this great bodhisattva; and learn
about, contemplate, and meditate on his words.

The Buddha first turned the wheel by teaching the Four Truths of Realization
three times through in twelve different aspects. From this teaching on the Four
Truths alone, some disciples who belonged to the class of Listeners and whose
minds were ripe grasped the meaning of dependent origination, free from the
extreme of thinking of things as self-existent. It has been explained by the
savior Nagarjuna in his treatises, and by Master Chandrakirti in his work on
the Commentary on the Sixty Verses on Reasoning, that the scriptures of the

Lower Way even describe explicitly the most subtle form of selflessness on
many occasions. The second time the Buddha turned the wheel he taught in
great detail about the selflessness of both the person and phenomena as is
found in the brief, medium-length and extensive sutras on the Perfection of
Wisdom, as well as in other works. The third time he turned the wheel he
gave the teaching of the Cycle of No Return which deals extensively with the
subject of method.

What I am going to explain is the holy Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life
which, in general, comments upon the true intent of all the speech of the
Buddhas, the highest of all spoken word. More particularly, however, this
book thoroughly explains the true intent of the scriptures of the Greater Way.
In so doing, it establishes in detail how every instance of the Buddhas' speech
is a part of a path to reach enlightenment which can be put into practice by
any particular person who belongs to the family of the Greater Way.

The author of this treatise is that master and realized being, Shantideva, who
had perfectly understood the true meaning of every instance of the highest
form of the spoken word. Master Shantideva was possessed of the great
compassion which treasures others more than oneself, and he totally lost
himself to helping others and making them happy; he was completely free of
the tendency of thinking only of his own happiness. More specifically, he was
a being who succeeded in employing the activities of extreme non-

conceptualization found in the Unsurpassable group of secret teachings, and
so brought the path of the Greater Way to its ultimate conclusion.

The title of this book in Sanskrit, one of the four great languages of ancient
India, is Bodhisattvacharyavatara. The meaning of this title can be explained in
the following way. The word bodhi [jang-chub in Tibetan] means
"enlightenment," the word sattva [sempa] means "warrior," charya [chupa] means
"activities," and avatara [jukpa] means "to enter."

,GNYIS PA NI, SANGS RGYAS DANG ZHES SOGS TE PHYOGS GANG DU GTOGS PA NGOS BZUNG BA'O, , DE YANG 'GYUR GYI BAR CHAD ZHI BA DANG , SDE SNOD MTHA' DAG GI DGONGS 'GREL YIN YANG , GTZO BOR MDO SDE'I SDE SNOD KYI DGONGS 'GREL DU SHES PAR BYA'O, , BAM PO'I GRANGS KYI BSHAD PA GO BAR SLA BAS MA BKOD DO,
The purpose of including the line which contains the words "Buddhas and..."
is to indicate which section of the scriptures this book is included into. This
involves preventing obstacles to the translation, and serves to help you realize
that even through this is a commentary upon all of the collections of scripture,
it focuses mainly upon the sutra collection.
The words which indicate the beginning of the first bampo, or major textual
division, are easy to understand, and thus require no commentary.
Meaning of the Body of the Text

,GSUM PA LA GNYIS, THEG PA CHEN PO'I LAM GYI RIM PA BSHAD PA LA 'JUG PA'I BYA BA, LAM GYI RIM PA BSHAD PA DNGOS SO,
I will explain the meaning of the body of the text in two main parts: first will
be an explanation of the preliminaries which precede an explanation of the
steps of the path of the greater way, and then the actual explanation of the
steps themselves.

,DANG PO LA GSUM, , MCHOD BRJOD DANG , BSHAD PAR DAM BCA' DANG , KHENGS SKYUNG ZHING RTZOM PAR SPRO BA'I RGYU MTSAN NO,
The preliminaries to the actual explanation will be in three sections: Master
Shantideva's offering of praise, his pledge to compose the work, and then
finally words to prevent pride arising, along with the reasons why he takes joy
in composing this work.

,DANG PO LA GSUM, DGOS DON DANG , BSDUS DON DANG , TSIG DON TO,
The offering of praise can be explained in three parts: its purpose, what it
includes, and its wording itself. It begins as follows:

,BDE GSHEGS CHOS KYI SKU MNGA' SRAS BCAS DANG ,
,PHYAG 'OS KUN LA'ANG GUS PAR PHYAG 'TSAL TE,
I bow down with great respect
To Those Who Have Gone to Well-Being--
Those who possess the Dharma Body--
And to all of their sons and daughters,
And all others worthy of prostration!

,DANG PO NI, YUL KHYAD PAR CAN GYI YON TAN BRJOD CING SKYABS SU SONG BAS RANG NYID SKYES BU DAM PAR RTOGS PA DANG , BSTAN BCOS RTZOM PA SOGS KYI BAR CHAD ZHI BA DANG , MTHAR NGES LEGS THOB CING GDUL BYA GZHAN GYIS KYANG DE'I RJES SU ZHUGS PAS LEGS TSOGS SU THAMS CAD 'GRUB PA'O,
The reason why Shantideva here expresses the wonderful spiritual qualities of
an extraordinary being, and why he goes for refuge, is so that other people will
understand that he is himself a holy person. Another reason he does so is to
prevent any obstacles which may come up as he is writing this book, or in any
of his other endeavors. His ultimate purpose is that he may achieve definite
good, and that by following in his footsteps other disciples will also be able to
achieve every single good thing that there is.

,GNYIS PA NI, DKON MCHOG GSUM DANG PHYAG BYA BA'I 'OS SU GYUR PA GZHAN DAG LA YANG PHYAG 'TSAL BA BSTAN TO,
This verse shows us that Master Shantideva in bowing down to the Three
Jewels, as well as to everyone else who is worthy of being prostrated to.

The Sanskrit word Sugata [Those Who have Gone to Well-Being] can be
explained in two ways. We can explain it in reference to either the things
which an Enlightened Being has eliminated, or in reference to the things which
he or she has realized.

First I will explain it in terms of that excellent virtue an Enlightened Being
possess of having totally eliminated every single bad quality there is. Because
an Enlightened Being has completely cleaned Himself of all the obstacles which
are related to bad thoughts, we can say that he has gone well, or beautifully,
and is like someone who has an well-formed body. Because he will never have
to return back to this cycle of suffering life by force of things poisoned with the
afflictions of the mind, we can say that he has gone like someone who has been
completely cured, or made well, from an illness. And because he has totally
removed all of those kinds of ignorance which are not related to the mental
afflictions, we can say that he has totally gone like a vase which is well-filled.
It is in this way that we call such a being One Who Has Gone to Well-Being.
We say "well-being" to refer to the different qualities described above with the
word "well", and we say "gone" to indicate that these beings have gone to the
nature which embodies those very qualities.

,DE GSUM GYIS RIM PA BZHIN DU PHYI ROL PA'I CHAGS BRAL DANG , RGYUN ZHUGS PHYIR 'ONG SOGS DANG , DMAN PA'I DGRA BCOM LAS KHYAD PAR DU BYAS PA'O,
Using the word "well" in these three different ways serves also to distinguish
Those Who Have Gone to Well-Being respectively from non-Buddhists who
have freed themselves of desire; from stream-enterers, once-returners, etc.; and
from lower foe-destroyers.

,RTOGS PA PHUN TSOGS KYI DBANG DU BYAS NA BDAG MED PA GNYIS KYI DE KHO NA NYID MNGON SUM DU MKHYEN PA DANG , MKHYEN PA BRTEN PA DANG , MA LUS PAR MKHYEN PAS BDE BAR GSHEGS PA'O, , DE DAG GIS KYANG RIM PA BZHIN DU GANG ZAG GSUM LAS KHYAD PAR DU 'PHAGS PA'O,
Now, I will explain "Sugata" in terms of an Enlightened Being having perfected
every single realization there is. Such a being has gone well in the sense that
His knowledge has directly perceived the suchness of the two kinds of lack of
self-nature, that His knowledge is firm, and that His knowledge is total. These
qualities of His knowledge respectively indicate how such a being is
exceedingly higher then the three groups of practitioners mentioned above.

,DES SANGS RGYAS DKON MCHOG LA BSTOD PA BSTAN TO,
This is Master Shantideva's praise of the Buddha Jewel.

,GNYIS PA LA GNYIS, SPYI'I RNAM GZHAG DANG , SO SO'I DON BSHAD PA'O,
The second section, the actual explanation of this book, is in two parts. First
will be a presentation of the overall structure of the book, and then an
explanation of each individual part.

,DANG PO NI, BSTAN BCOS 'DIS SKYES BU CHEN PO'I BSAM PA SBYONG BA'I YAN LAG TU SKYES BU CHUNG 'BRING GI BSAM PA SBYONG BA SNGON DU BTANG NAS, BYANG CHUB KYI MCHOG TU SEMS BSKYED DE SPYOD PA SBYIN PA LA SOGS PA'I PHA ROL TU PHYIN PA DRUG LA BSLABS NAS, SANGS RGYAS PA'I LAM GYI RIM PA RDZOGS PAR STON PA YIN NO,
This book presents, in their entirety, each one of the steps of the path to
enlightenment. It begins by telling you the way to practice the contemplations
for people of lesser and medium capacity as an adjunct to practicing the
contemplations for people of great capacity. Then it goes on to teach you how
to develop the wish to achieve supreme enlightenment, and how--after you
have developed that wish--you should train yourself in the perfection of
giving, along with the other five perfections.

,DE LA THOG MAR BYANG CHUB KYI MCHOG TU SEMS BSKYED PA LA DE'I PHAN YON LEGS PAR BSAMS NAS SPRO SHUGS LHAG PAR 'PHEL BA ZHIG DGOS PA LE'U DANG POS STON LA SKYES BU CHUNG 'BRING GI BSAM PA SBYONG BA DE'I YAN LAG TU 'CHAD DO,
The first chapter explains how, in the beginning, you must increase your joyful
energy to its very highest by thoroughly contemplating the benefits which
come from developing the wish to achieve supreme enlightenment. This
chapter also touches upon the way you should practice, as an adjunct, the
contemplations for people of lesser and medium capacity.

You must go about developing the wish to achieve supreme enlightenment,
that wish whose very root is love and compassion, in the same way that you
would go about preparing to welcome a King who ruled the entire world by
cleaning your house, and so on. You will be able to acquire this wish by
purifying all of the factors which obstruct your spiritual realizations, and
gathering together the power of good deeds which promote them. These two
subjects are covered respectively in the second and third chapters.

The fourth chapter teaches you why you must be careful once you have
developed the wish, so that the good energy you have amassed from training
yourself in the activities of a bodhisattva does not degenerate.
The chapters which follow teach you how to put the six perfections into
practice. With regard to this, the fifth chapter is devoted to an extensive
presentation of how to train yourself to live an ethical life through maintaining
your mindfulness and awareness, and the next four chapters are successively
devoted to how to train yourself in not getting angry, joyfully doing good
deeds, meditative concentration, and wisdom.

The tenth chapter explains in detail how you can learn that attitude which
wants to give away to others your own body, all of your possessions, along
with every good thing you've ever done. And it teaches you how to sweeten
your acts of giving through dedication. Although the tenth chapter treats with
great thoroughness how it is that you should train yourself in the perfection
of giving, this subject is also taught on other occasions, such as in the chapter

on how to develop the wish for enlightenment. The subject of what it is to be
a Buddha, which is the final result, is treated in the ninth chapter.

Course X: Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life, Part I
Reading Two: The Benefits of the Wish for Enlightenment
The following reading is taken from the Entry Point for Children of the Victorious
Buddhas (rGyal-sras 'jug-ngogs), a commentary by Gyaltsab Je Darma Rinchen
(1364-1432) on the book called Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life (Byang-chub-
sems-dpa'i spyod-pa la 'jug-pa) by Master Shantideva (c. 700 AD).

The second part [the more detailed contemplation upon the benefits of the
wish for enlightenment] has four divisions: an explanation of the benefits of the
wish for enlightenment, identifying just what the wish for enlightenment is, a
presentation of the reasons why these benefits occur with the wish, and words
in praise of persons who are practicing the wish.

DANG , MING DANG DON KHYAD PAR CAN THOB PA DANG , PHAN YON DPES BSHAD PA'O,
The first of these divisions has three sections of its own: a description of how
the wish has the power to destroy all bad deeds and to accomplish all good
deeds; how those who achieve the wish attain both an exceptional name, as
well as the point of the name; and metaphors which are used to explain the
benefits.

,DANG PO LA GSUM, SDIG PA CHEN PO 'JOMS PA DANG , BDE BA MCHOG BSGRUB NUS PA DANG , JI LTAR 'DOD PA'I DON BSGRUB NUS PA'O,
The first of these sections has three of its own: how the wish has the power to
destroy great bad deeds; how it has the power to accomplish the highest form
of happiness; and how it has the power to bring about anything you might
ever wish for.
 , SDIG PA STOBS CHEN SHIN TU MI BZAD PA,
,DE NI RDZOGS PA'I BYANG CHUB SEMS MIN PA,
,DGE GZHAN GANG GIS ZIL GYIS GNON PAR 'GYUR,
What kind of goodness could there ever be
Other than the wish for total enlightenment
That could overwhelm those negative deeds
Of dreadful and awesome strength?

,DANG PO NI, BYANG CHUB KYI SEMS GNYIS BSGOM PA LA 'BAD PAR RIGS TE, DMYAL BA'I RGYU LA SOGS PA'I SDIG PA MI BZAD PA DE NI RDZOGS PA'I BYANG CHUB KYI SEMS MIN PA DGE BA GZHAN GANG GIS ZIL GYIS GNON PAR 'GYUR TE GANG GIS KYANG ZIL GYIS GNON MI NUS PA'I PHYIR RO, , DON DAM SEMS BSKYED KYIS SGRIB PA'I SA BON SPONG BA'I NUS PA YOD PA 'DIR BSHAD BYA'I GTZO BO MA YIN GYI, 'DIR NI KUN RDZOB SEMS BSKYED KYIS NGAN 'GRO'I RGYU SNGAR BSAGS 'DAG CING PHYI MA RGYUN GCOD PAR BYED PA'I PHAN YON BSTAN TO,
Making great efforts to practice the two forms of the wish for enlightenment
is something which is very right to do. This is because we have committed
negative deeds of dreadful strength, deeds that would cause us to be born into the
hells, or the like. And what kind of goodness could there ever be, other than the
wish for total enlightenment, that could overwhelm them? The answer is that there
is no such other goodness.
The main point being mentioned here is not the fact that the ultimate form of
the wish has the power to eliminate the seeds for spiritual obstacles. The
intent rather is to indicate the benefit of the wish where, in its "deceptive"
form, the wish functions to clear away those causes already created which
would take one to the births of misery, and also functions to prevent the
continued creation of these causes in the future.

,BSKAL PA DU MAR RAB DGONGS MDZAD PA YI,
,THUB DBANG RNAMS KYIS 'DI NYID PHAN PAR GZIGS,
The Lords among Victors contemplated the question
For many millions of years and saw
That this alone could be of benefit.

Again we can say that making efforts to practice the wish is something which
is very right to do. This is because the Lords among Victors have considered and
contemplated, for many "countless" periods of millions of years each, the question
of what could be of benefit to, or a way to achieve the ends of, all living beings.
And what they saw was that this wish for enlightenment alone would be so.

,'DIS NI TSAD MED SKYE BO'I TSOGS RNAMS KYIS,

It is this wish which allows a limitless
Mass of sentient kind to attain

It is this wish for enlightenment which is like a special seed, one that has the
power which allows a limitless number of living beings, a great mass of sentient
kind, to attain the highest form of happiness. And it allows them to do so with
ease, with perfect ease--that is, without having to undertake any such difficult
spiritual practices as undertaking the life of a cave-dwelling yogi. It's just as
the lines say which go,

What person with any intelligence at all
Would lose heart in going easily to ease?

Those who hope to smash the thousand pains
Of the cycle of life, or to solve
The unhappiness of every living being,
Or bring them to the many thousand forms
Of happiness, must never give up
This very wish for enlightenment.

And we can say once more that it is very right to practice this very wish, for
it is the highest means of helping all living things, both oneself and all others.
This is because there is no higher method for persons of any level, whether
you are one of those who is practicing the attitude of those of medium capacity,
and who thus hopes to smash the thousand pains of the cycle of life as they exist
within your own being; or whether you are one of those who is practicing the
attitude of those of greater capacity--who hopes to solve the unhappiness of
absolutely every living being, or to bring them to the many thousand forms of
happiness, meaning the happiness of the higher realms and definite good.
These persons then must strive to develop this very wish for enlightenment, and
never give it up, which is to say, never let it degenerate once one has succeeded
in developing it.

Once they've succeeded in developing
The wish for enlightenment, then even
Those miserable beings chained in the prison
Of cyclic life are in an instant referred to
By Those Gone to Bliss as their very own
Daughters or sons, and are worthy to be bowed to
By the entire world, of men and gods.

And again we can say that it is a very right thing to make great efforts in
developing the wish for enlightenment, for the following reasons. Suppose
that any person succeeds in developing the wish for enlightenment, in either the
form of a prayer or activity itself. Within the very next instant after doing so
they are given an exceptional name, for Those Gone to Bliss then refer to them as
their very own daughters or sons. They also attain the point of this name, which
is that they become worthy to be bowed to, worthy to have the entire world, of
both men and gods, clasp their hands at their breasts and prostrate to them.

And it is not the case that only those great bodhisattvas residing at high levels
obtain these benefits, because even those miserable beings chained by their mental
afflictions and past deeds in the prison of cyclic life also reap these same benefits
in the very next instant after succeeding in developing the wish.

Here is the third part, where metaphors are used to explain the benefits of the
wish. There are six such metaphors, to express the following: changing the
inferior to the supreme; being difficult to find and very precious; giving
unending results and continually increasing; being able to protect one from
some great fear; smashing bad deeds without any difficulty at all; and finally,
being described as beneficial in the sutras.

Once you have contemplated its benefits, then you are to keep--that is, you
must keep--this thing called the "wish for enlightenment" as firmly as you can: find
it, and then prevent it from ever lessening. This is because it is like the highest
form of alchemical elixir, the kind where you need only a single gram of the
elixir to change a thousand grams of iron into gold. And this is so because
with the wish, and with it alone, you can transform this filthy body you've taken
on--a body which is filthy both in the sense of what has brought it about, and
from the point of view of the stuff from which it is made--into the holy form of
a Victorious One, of immeasurable value beyond all value.

This is an abbreviated presentation of the benefits of the wish explained in the

quicksilver known as "goldmaker," where you can use a single gram of the
elixir to transform a thousand grams of iron into gold.

of each and every one of the troubles of this cycle of life--should seek to
develop, well, the wish for enlightenment, and then keep it firm, without ever
lessening, for it is like the king among the lords of all precious jewels. That
single and matchless captain of living kind, the Buddha, is like a master ship
captain who guides the merchants of old to the Isle of Jewels. He and all those
beings who possess the state of mind beyond all limit--unlimited wisdom--have
searched at length, very thoroughly, to find what it is that would be the highest
method of clearing away all the poverty of living kind. And they have found
that the wish, and only it, is of great value; that is, they have seen that it is a
method of great rarity and benefit.

Practicing the wish for enlightenment is moreover a right thing to do for those
who hope to see their good deeds never die, but increase ever further. This is
because all other good deeds, meaning those that are not imbued by this wish,
are like the plantain tree: they give their fruits and, once they have done so, it is
always the case that their ability to produce further fruits dies away. The wish
for enlightenment though is an evergreen: it is like a wish-giving tree, in that it
never dies by giving its fruits, but rather ever increases, higher and higher.

As the Sutra Taught by Inexhaustible Understanding states,
A drop of water which falls into the great sea never disappears, even in
the period of an eon of millions of years. Virtues which have been
dedicated to enlightenment are just the same: they never disappear
before the state of perfect enlightenment is achieved.

A person may have committed deeds
That are dreadful in the extreme, and yet
Anyone who relies on this can be freed
From all of them in an instant, as though they relied

Not choose to rely upon this very wish?

For what reason, why, would those who live with care (meaning those who have
gladly taken it upon themselves to master the way of life relating to the
practice of the wish for enlightenment) not rely upon this very wish? It would
be right for them to do so, for the following reason. A person may have
committed deeds that are dreadful in the extreme, may have done things to hurt the
Three Jewels, or else committed one of the immediate deeds or something
similar, and yet they can be freed from all the fears of the lower realms in an
instant, if they rely on this wish for enlightenment. This is because it is like
relying on a warrior to save oneself from some horrible fear that one might meet
with while travelling along some road.

This wish for enlightenment has a tremendous ability to destroy the effects of
bad deeds. It is as though this wish were the fire that comes at the end of time,
meaning at the end of the eon of destruction--the fire that destroys the entire
physical world from the first meditation level on down. This is because the
wish can burn, with certainty, and in a single instant, even the greatest of bad deeds:
those deeds which would force one into a birth in the hells.
If the wish, by the way, has the power to destroy even those kinds of karma
which are certain to produce an experience, then there is no need to say that
it has the ability to do so with those types of karma which are not certain to
produce an experience. Those of the Greater Vehicle can utilize an act of
purification, in which all four of the forces of purification are present, in order
to purify themselves of the expected ripening of those types of karma which
are certain to produce an experience. The expression "certain to produce an
experience" then refers to those kinds of karma which are proven, through
many cases of scriptural authority and also through reasoning, to be certain to
produce an experience unless one practices the appropriate antidote to their power.

The benefits of the wish for enlightenment, as described above, are certain to
occur if you succeed in developing it. This is because the benefits of this wish,
and its praises, which are beyond all reckoning, really are just as they were
spoken to the younger bodhisattva Sudana, in the sutra called Stalks in Array, by
the bodhisattva who is the Gentle Protector, the One Who Possesses Wisdom.

This point is explained in great detail in the sutra mentioned on such occasions
as where it begins by saying,
Oh son of noble family, this wish for enlightenment is like a seed for
each and every quality of an enlightened being. And because it makes
all the pure white qualities of every living being grow and increase, it
is like a rich field of soil. . .
And continues up to,
. . . It is as well like an excellent [wish-giving] vase, for it fulfills
your every wish. And it is, finally, like a spear, in that you can
use it to defeat the enemy of anything related to the mental
afflictions.

Course X: Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life, Part I
Reading Three: How to Make Offerings
The following reading is taken from the Entry Point for Children of the Victorious
Buddhas (rGyal-sras 'jug-ngogs), a commentary by Gyaltsab Je Darma Rinchen
(1364-1432) on the book called Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life (Byang-chub-
sems-dpa'i spyod-pa la 'jug-pa) by Master Shantideva (c. 700 AD).

The second major section concerns how to train oneself in the activities of a
bodhisattva, once one has been able to develop the two forms of the wish for
enlightenment. This section itself has two parts: how to acquire the wish for
enlightenment, and how to train oneself in the perfections, which are the
activities of the bodhisattva.

The first of these two parts has two divisions of its own. The first concerns
purifying oneself of the hindering conditions that consist of bad deeds. This
is done by applying all four of the forces of purification, once one has already
performed the preliminary practices of prostration, offering, and going for
refuge. The second concerns the actual practice of acquiring the wish for
enlightenment, once one has already completed the actions of accumulating
conducive conditions, which is done through the various practices which begin
with rejoicing in virtue.

We will explain the first of these two divisions in two steps: an explanation of
the actual text of the chapter, and an explanation of the chapter's name. The
former of these will proceed in four stages represented by the four practices
of offering, prostration, going for refuge, and purifying oneself of bad deeds.
For the first of these we will cover the need to make offerings, and then the
kinds of offerings themselves.

Those oceans of high spiritual qualities:
To the sons and daughters of the Buddhas,
In order to acquire this jewel wish.

You should make offerings in an excellent way, meaning that you should offer the
most exquisite objects with thoughts and in a manner which is filled with
reverence. What should be the goal of making these offerings? You should
present them in order to acquire the jewel of the wish for enlightenment, which
supplies every single good thing there is to every single living being.
And to whom should you make the offerings? They should be made first of
all to Those Who Have Gone That Way. And then they should be made to the
holy jewel of the Dharma, so called because it is the Dharma of holy realized
beings. This Dharma consists of the truth of cessation, and the truth of the
path, in the greater way. The truth of cessation here includes both natural
purity and also the absence of any temporary impurities.
And you should finally make offerings to those great ones who are like oceans
of high spiritual qualities: to sons and daughters of the Buddhas who are realized
beings such as the Lord, Loving Eyes (Avalokiteshvara), and Gentle Voice
(Manjushri).

We will discuss the kinds of offerings in three parts: the offering of things
which have no owner; the giving of your own body; and the offering of things
which you emanate with your own thoughts. For the first we will describe
what it is we offer, and then how it is we offer it, and finally the reason for
giving things which have no owner.

and the like, as many as there may be. Give each and every precious substance
contained in the planet: gold, silver, and anything of the sort. Give all the pure
and lovely water of every ocean, lake, and other bodies of water that exists. Give
the eight precious mountains of gold and all the rest, and so too give all the
forests, give all the quiet places of refuge, all the lovely spots, all the many kinds
of plants, each studded with a variety of jewel flowers, each adorned in beauty.
Give all the trees whose branches are bent low under the weight of fine ripe fruit.
Give all the fine fragrances and incenses that exist, whether they be natural, or
concocted, or transformed, and include even those which are found in the worlds
of pleasure beings, serpent-beings, and the like. Give the wishing tree, which
supplies your every wish, and give the tree made of precious substances. Give
lovely lakes and bathing ponds, ones that grant your every desire, bedecked with
lotus blossoms, and give the waterbirds who live upon them, in all their beauty,
singing their splendid songs. Give every kind of grain, growing of its own accord,
without ever being planted. Offer these, and offer any other lovely object which is
worthy of presenting to the Jewels. Certain authors who failed to understand the
commentary have explained the order of the root text in a different way.

which are only imagined in the mind? Would it not be better to actually offer
some lovely object or another?" I am not the kind of person who has been able,
in the past, to accumulate any great amount of merit, and so I am extremely
poor, in the sense that I possess none of the things that I would like to. And
so I have no rights at all to any other kind of wealth that I might offer. I beg you
therefore, you who are the Protector who thinks exclusively of what might be of
benefit to others, to use your power to accept this offering I have made, this object
which has no other owner, and to do so for my own sake.

There are two major divisions to our third point, the offering of things which
you emanate with your own thoughts. The first of them has twelve parts of
its own: the offering of bathing, of lovely clothing, precious adornments,
ointments, flowers, incense, fine foods, lights, mansions, parasols, and music,
followed by the act of blessing, so that the stream of offering can continue
never-ending. The offering of bathing covers three subjects: the bathing
chamber, the way in which to offer the bathing, and how to wipe dry the holy
body.

water which is scented with various fragrances, and made of gold and other
precious materials. The water should also be mixed with lovely blooms, and the
bathing done while singing a great number of beautiful songs, and playing
wonderful music.

Reading Four: The Four Forces of Purification, Part One
The following reading is taken from the Entry Point for Children of the Victorious
Buddhas (rGyal-sras 'jug-ngogs), a commentary by Gyaltsab Je Darma Rinchen
(1364-1432) on the book called Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life (Byang-chub-
sems-dpa'i spyod-pa la 'jug-pa) by Master Shantideva (c. 700 AD).

The fourth section here concerns purifying yourself of bad deeds, through
using all four of the forces together. We begin with a general presentation.
You should from the very beginning make efforts to see that you are not
sullied by performing any harmful actions. Despite your efforts, however,
such an action may occur, due to some instance of carelessness, an attack of
mental afflictions, or the like. It would be a mistake in such a case to simply
ignore the bad deed; you should rather exert yourself in the various methods
of repairing the damage. These methods were taught by our compassionate
Teacher.

Instances in which you have committed some transgression of your vows, at
whichever level of vows you may have, should be repaired according to the
methods prescribed for those particular vows. For repairing the damage
caused by other kinds of bad deeds you should utilize the four powers. As the
Sutra on the Four Practices states,
If, oh Loving One, some great bodhisattva has
succeeded in the four practices, then even those bad
deeds which have been both committed and
collected can be overcome. What are the four
practices? They are as follows: the activity of
destruction; the activity of applying the antidote;
the force of restraining from the particular bad
deed; and the force of the foundation.
The expression "committed and collected" refers to actions whose karmic
results are "certain to be experienced." If even these types of karmic results can
be overcome by the four practices, then there is no need to mention those
which are not certain to be experienced.

DE LA STOBS DANG PO NI MI DGE BA'I LAS BYAS PA LA 'GYOD PA MANG BA YIN TE 'DI SKYE BA LA MI DGE BA'I LAS KYIS 'BRAS BU GSUM BSKYED TSUL LEGS PAR BSGOM DGOS SO,
The first of these four forces involves feeling strong regret over having
committed some negative action. In order to achieve this level of regret, you
must contemplate carefully the way in which negative actions trigger three
different karmic results.

MCHOD PA LA BRTEN PA DANG , MTSAN LA BRTEN PA SOGS SO,
The second force, as described in the Compendium of Trainings, consists of
performing practices such as studying the profound scriptures of the canon,
meditating on emptiness, reciting secret words, preparing physical
representations of the holy bodies of enlightened beings, making offerings, and
reciting the names of high beings.

The third force is to restrain yourself perfectly from ever committing these
negative actions again in the future. The fourth consists of meditating upon
the wish for enlightenment, and similar practices. Here it is the first force
which is described in great detail. The points to be considered are the time at
which the bad deeds may have been committed, the cause, the mode of
expression, the undertaking of the deed, its object, and how the deed was
committed.

Next we present some detail on each of the four: the force of the activity of
destruction; the force of the foundation; the force of the activity of applying the
antidote; and the force of restraining from the particular bad deed.
THE FORCE OF THE ACTIVITY OF DESTRUCTION

SDIG PAS 'JIGS PA'I TSUL BSAM PA'O,
We will explain the first force in four steps: an explanation of the process of
regret, which you reach by examining the way in which you have committed
the negative deed; the practice of developing regret out of fear that you may
die while you still possess the negative deed, along with an explanation of how
to go for refuge; the practice of developing regret by considering with special
attention the way in which you have committed a negative deed which is
meaningless; and the practice of learning to fear negative deeds.

The first of these steps has four parts of its own: requesting the one to whom
you are going to reveal your negative action to attend to your confession; a
method for a general purification of negative actions you have committed,
according to time, cause, type, or other detail; a method for the purification of
especially powerful negative actions which have been committed towards some
special object; and learning to perform purification due to regret inspired by
having considered carefully the unwanted karmic results that the action will
bring you.

totally enlightened beings, and bodhisattvas who reside in every direction of the world:
to those beings who possess great compassion. I request them to hear my
confession, which I make out of regret for the negative deeds I have

In the cycle of life without beginning,
In both this and my other lives,
I committed bad deeds without understanding
And encouraged others to commit them;
Overcome by my total failure to understand, I took joy.
Now I see my mistakes, as many as I may have made,
And I confess them to the Protectors
From the bottom of my heart.

Here is the second point. During all the time that I have circled around in the
cycle of life, for time without beginning, in both this and my other lives, I have
committed bad deeds myself. I have as well encouraged others to commit them.
And because of the fact that I was overcome by my total failure to understand the
principles of deeds and their consequences, I took joy in the negative actions
committed by others. I see now that all of my mistakes, as many as I may have
made, truly are mistakes, and with regret that comes from the bottom of my heart
I confess these mistakes to the Protectors--I conceal nothing, I hide nothing.

Here is the third point. The person who was mistaken--that is, I
myself--confess whatever harm I may ever have done towards the Three Jewels, or
towards my parents, and towards any other such high object of merit; I confess
all these actions, which were caused by the mental afflictions known as the three
poisons, and which were expressed with either my bodily actions, my speech, and
my thoughts.

Next is the fourth point. I am a person full of negative actions; I have been infected
by a great number of bad deeds, by emotions such as attachment, which will act
as causes that will bring me the karmic result of a birth in the hells or the like.
All the negative deeds that I have done, actions like killing and the like, are going
to create for me immense suffering; they are therefore dreadful, and I confess
them to every one of the Guides.

Next is the part about developing regret out of fear that you may die while
you still possess the negative deed, and so on. Suppose that I die while I still
possess the negative deed: suppose I was unable to clean myself of the deed
immediately after committing it, and failed to clean it from my mind. The
Lord of Death then could come and I could be finished off first, and I would have
to take a birth in one of the lower realms. And so I must avail myself of any
way possible in which I will certainly be freed from my negative actions, and that
I do so speedily; and so I beg you protect me, by helping me to do so.

This Lord of Death cannot be trusted,
He waits for no one, finished or not.
He takes all sorts suddenly, those sick and well,
So feel not certain about your life.

"What kind of protection," one may ask, "is it that we need, so quickly, while
we have yet to die, and have still not purified ourselves of our bad deeds?"
This Lord of Death cannot be trusted, even for a single moment of time, and he
waits for no one: he has absolutely no interest in whether you have finished
purifying yourself of your negative actions or not. His coming in no way

depends upon whether what you have hoped to do is done or not. All sorts
of people die suddenly, before their life has reached its normal length, and
whether they have gone through some sickness or whether they are well.
Therefore you should feel no certainty about your life, no assurance even that you
will not die this very day. And since this fact that you can feel no certainty is
true, you should quickly purify yourself of your negative actions.

Next is the point about meaningless misdeeds. Here first we cover the kind
of regret you have about negative actions you have committed for the sake of
your relatives, or for the sake of your body or possessions or anything of the
like, all because you failed to realize how they were nothing you could ever
depend upon. After that will come a metaphor to show how, at the moment
of death, none of these is anything more than a memory. Then we will cover
the kind of regret you reach about having committed these kinds of negative
actions once you have seen directly as well how none of the things for whom
you committed the actions were in any way something you could depend
upon. And then finally we will discuss the regret that you develop over the
negative deeds you committed because you failed to realize that there was no
certainty at all when you would die.

Here is the first of the four points. I will have to give up it all--my relatives,
and all my possessions and the rest, and even the flesh and blood and such
which came with me when I was born--and travel on to the life beyond, alone,
by myself. But I have failed to realize this fact, and so I have committed an entire
variety of bad deeds for the sake of protecting my friends and defeating my
enemies. This is one reason why I should now feel regret.

And it was wrong to commit bad deeds for these reasons, because shortly
afterwards the enemies cease to exist, and the friends to cease to exist, and I myself
cease to exist as well. Just so everything else, the relatives and the possessions
and so on, ceases too. Nothing is in the least bit dependable, and so I should
also feel regret at having committed negative actions due to any attachment or
dislike for any of them.

Think of some minor pleasure that you might experience during a dream. When
you wake up, the pleasure is no longer anything but a memory. All the objects
that you might deceive yourself into thinking are pleasant in this life, and
which you use, are the same. When you die they are soon nothing but some
memory. Therefore you should resolve, from this moment on, and time and
time again, that you will only practice the Dharma. All those things that have
passed are no longer here, and so they become nothing more than a memory.

Even here in the present moment, in the time that we have lived, we have seen many
who were our friends, and many who were our enemies, slip into the past. But
whatever dreadful consequences there may be from all the negative that we
committed for their sakes still lies before us. It's like the lines that say,
Since they can never take upon themselves
Any share of the suffering,
What use then are the best of friends,
Who only serve to hinder us?
Thus we must feel, over and over again, deep regret at having committed bad
deeds for their sakes.

In just a single instant of time as I live in this condition, of having no certainty
when it is that I will die--that is to say, suddenly, without my even realizing it,
I commit a great number of different bad deeds, due to my ignorance, my tendency
of liking some things, and disliking other things. These now will take me to a
birth in the lower realms. I must contemplate thus the facts of how my death
is certain, and how the time that I will die is not certain at all, and how when
I die there is nothing at all that can help me except the Dharma. I must think
carefully too of all the problems of these lower realms. I must feel, and feel
again and again, deep regret then at having committed these negative deeds.

This brings us to the fourth step in the explanation of the first of the forces: the
practice of learning to fear negative deeds. Here too there are four parts. The
first is learning to feel fear about the certainty of death, which is a fact because
you cannot add any time onto your life, which is melting away constantly,
without a moment's hesitation; and to feel fear that you might die while you
still possess negative deeds. The second is thinking about how, if you fail to
purify yourself of the power of negative actions, you will be forced even in this
very life to experience suffering. The third is a description of the reason why
great fear will come, and the fourth a description of how, in your future life,
you will be tormented by pain.

Day and night, without hesitating
This life is forever dropping,
There is no extra life set aside
That is ever going to come to you.

That someone like me wouldn't die?

Here is the first of the four. No matter which of the three kinds of activities
you may be engaged in--going somewhere, sitting somewhere, or sleeping;
and during all the day and all the night, without hesitating even for a moment,
this life is forever "dropping," which is to say, decreasing. There is no extra life set
aside somewhere that is ever going to come to you later. How then, for what
reason, could it ever happen that someone like me would not certainly die? It is
definite that I will die, and there is no certainty when I will die. Therefore I
must make great efforts to purify myself of all my negative actions. If one
reads the Tibetan word for "drop" in this verse with an alternate spelling, it
becomes the word for "mark," and the section could then be read as "life
marked by days and nights."

Our discussion of the suffering in this life has itself three sections, which are
all based on what would happen if you failed to purify yourself of negative
actions. These are descriptions of how people like your family and friends
have no ability to protect you; how you will have to fear if you have not been
able to perform any good deeds; and how you will be tormented by regret.

You may be lying down on your bed
Surrounded by your friends and family,
But it's only you, and you alone,
Who will have to undergo the pain.
When Lord Death's messengers take hold of you.
What's the use of your family,
And what use are your friends?

Here is the first. If you fail to perform good deeds, then when you die you
experience the sufferings caused by the sensations of having life stop; you may
be lying down on your bed surrounded by your friends and family, people who love
you with their whole hearts, but it is only you, and you alone, who will have to
undergo the pain. And the problem is not only that there is no one there who
can stop the terror--the messengers of the Lord of Death, in hideous forms, take
hold of you. What is the use of your family at this point? And of what use are
friends? Only the Dharma can protect you at that moment.

Here is the second point. At the moment of death, the highest of all protection
is good deeds, and good deeds alone: practices such as going for refuge, and
maintaining an ethical way of life. I failed though during my life to follow these
practices. These lines are describing another kind of regret, the kind you feel
about having failed to do good deeds during your life.

Here is the third point. Here you are calling out to the sources of protection,
with the words, "Oh Protectors." I have been careless, I was not aware, I did not
know, that I would be faced like this with the terrors of the lower realms. And so
I accomplished many negative deeds, all for the sake of people such as my relatives
of this life, this life which is so fleeting, so impermanent.

There are people who are about
To have one of their limbs cut off;
And on the day they're dragged away
To the place, they are seized with terror.
Their whole appearance from before is transformed:
Their mouths go dry, eyes bulge, and the rest.
Suppose then that you are taken hold of
By the messengers of the Lord of Death,
By those monstrous and terrifying creatures,
And are stricken by that great fear, the unique pain.
If one can go through the change before
Then what need then is there ever to speak
Of this most desperate of all situations?

This brings us to our description of the reason why great fear will come. There
are kinds of people who are about to undergo some punishment where they will
have one of their limbs cut off; on the day that the guards drag them away to the
place where the sentence is to be carried out, they are seized with terror. Their
whole appearance is transformed from what it was before: their mouths go dry from
the fear, their faces go pale, their eyes bulge from their sockets, and the rest.
Suppose now that you are taken hold of by the messengers of the Lord of Death, by
monstrous and terrifying creatures from another realm altogether. And suppose
as well that you are stricken by that great fear, by the unique pain of death itself.
If people who are about to have nothing more than a limb cut off go through
the change we just spoke of before, then what need is there ever to speak of the
incredible terror that you will, in this most desperate of all situations, come to
experience? This is another reason why you should feel regret for the wrong
things you have done.

Here now is the fourth part: the description of how, in your future life, you
will be tormented by pain. And once you have taken your birth in the hells,
and you see the hellguards coming for you, then will you be overcome with
fear, and scream out, "Ah! Where is there now anyone who can save me completely
from this horror?" Your face takes on a look of terror, your eyes open wide with panic,
and you turn in every direction to look for someone who can help. You can look, but
then you realize that there is no one to protect you, no one in any direction at all, and
then the darkness comes and envelops you. Thus it is that you must, from this
very moment, take refuge in the Three Jewels. Once you are in this place, in the
hells, there is no one at all who can protect you from the terrors of the hells, there
is at that moment absolutely nothing that you can do for yourself. And so you
should, right now, make efforts in those practices which can save you from the
terror later.

With this we have reached our explanation of the second the four forces, which
is the force of the foundation. We proceed in three steps: instructions on
seeking refuge in the Three Jewels from this very moment; seeking help in the
sons and daughters of the Victors, those who possess the power of prayers;

for some kind of protection, but you will find none. The Victorious Buddhas, the
Saviors of all living kind, exert themselves in advance, in order to protect every

Thus it is that you should take refuge quickly, today itself, in those of great power,

properly, eliminates every fear in this cycle of life. And you should do so too with
the assembly of bodhisattvas who have been able to reach the state of a realized

The one who lives in compassion, who is free of all error;
And I beg you to protect me,
A person who had committed great bad deeds.
I seek protection in all those saviors
Whose hearts are filled with great compassion:
I cry out, from my heart to the realized pair
Named "Essence of Space" and "Essence of Earth."
I take refuge as well in the One with the Diamond;
When those full of hate, such as the messengers of death,

I feel absolute terror over the fears of the lower realms, and so I offer myself to
the Excellent One (Samantabadra), that son of the Victors who possesses the
power of prayers, and beg him to protect me from these fears. I myself--that
is, without the urging of anyone else at all--offer this body of mine as well to
Gentle Voice (Manjushri), with thoughts of great faith. And I call out in the voice
from a desperate and frightening situation, I cry out, to that one who
accomplishes the aims of others in two ways--with perfect spontaneity and in
an uninterrupted flow: to the one who lives in compassion, who is free of all error,
to the savior--whose name is Loving Eyes (Avalokiteshvara). And how is it that
I cry out? In the words, "I beg you to protect me, a person who has committed great
bad deeds." Just so do I seek protection in all those saviors whose hearts are filled
with great compassion: those realized bodhisattvas such as the pair named "Essence
of Space" (Akashagarba) and "Essence of Earth" (Kshitigarba), and so too Loving
One (Maitreya), and the Ender of Obstacles (Nivarana Vishkambi). "I cry out,
from my heart, so please, protect me." And finally I take refuge in the One with
the Diamond, in the Holder of the Diamond (Vajrapani). When those full of hate
living beings--when those such as the messengers of death or the
hellguards--catch sight of him, they are filled with fear, and are forced to flee in
every direction.

THE FORCE OF THE ANTIDOTE

Here next is our expanded explanation of the third of the four forces: the force
of the activity of applying an antidote. Here there are two parts: the reason
why it is fitting for you to make efforts in purifying yourself of your bad
deeds, and why it is fitting to do so quickly. The first of these parts has itself
two points: using the metaphor of a patient in order to demonstrate why you
must purify yourself of your bad deeds quickly, and then using the metaphor
of a cliff to demonstrate why you must purify yourself. The former of these
contains three sections: setting forth the metaphor and what it refers to; a

description of the very serious problems caused by the illness of the three
poisons, and of the rarity of the medicine used to cure them; and finally why
it is therefore appropriate to follow the advice of the supreme physician, the
Teacher.

,'DOD CHAGS LA SOGS NYES PA BRGYA'I,
,NAD KYIS RTAG BTAB SMOS CI DGOS,
Even in a case where you're endangered
By some normal illness, you must still
Follow the advice of a physician.
There's no need to mention then
What you should do in the clutches
Of the disease of a thousand evils,
Of liking things and the rest.

Even in a case where you are endangered by some normal illness--that is, where the
components such as wind or bile within your body are in a state of
disturbance, and you have reason to fear that this might be fatal--you must still
follow the advice of a physician, as a method for curing your disease. People like
you and I though have been in the clutches of the greatest and most chronic
disease of all, the three poisons of liking things and the rest, constantly, for time
with no beginning. And these three are a disease which acts as the source for
many thousands and millions of evils. If we would listen to the advice of a
physician in the case of the normal disease, then there is no need to mention how
fitting it would be for us to follow the antidote that has been prescribed for us

by the highest of all physicians, by the victorious Buddhas, as an antidote for
removing our sickness. Therefore it is fitting for us to make great efforts in
applying the antidotes for negative deeds.

Even a single instance of these deeds such as anger at a bodhisattva is enough
to waste all the human beings living in our world; that is, to send them to the
hells. Where then could you ever find an antidote, other than the holy words
that impart teachings such as how to practice the path--where could you find
any other medicine for treating these great harms? You could search everywhere,
even in the realms of the worldly god named Pure One, or other such beings,
but still never find another; and thus it is extremely rare.

The Omniscient One is a physician for this;
He's given instructions for uprooting all pains,
Though we fail to follow and concentrate.

Here is the third point. The Omniscient One is a physician for this illness; he is
one who removes all of it, all the sickness of the mental afflictions, and who
has spoken the instructions for uprooting all the pains of these afflictions. We
though fail to follow these instructions, and concentrate on the causes that keep
us in the cycle of life endlessly, that throw us to the lower realms. This is, as
the text says, "incredibly ignorant," meaning a situation which is disgraceful. As
such you must, from the bottom of your heart, go for refuge in the Teacher,
and practice the teachings of this Teacher in the proper way.

A person must be very cautious
Even of small, ordinary cliffs;
There is no need to say then
That we must take care around
Those many thousands of yojana high,
And where a fall means a very long time.

A person must be very cautious whenever there is any danger of falling even from
one of those small, ordinary cliffs, the kind around a mountain or the like--the
type of cliff where, if you fall off, all you can hurt is one of your arms or legs.
There is no need to say then that you must be cautious about the kind of cliffs
such as the one which is 32,000 yojana high [about 154,000 miles, or the
distance at which the hell of No Respite is said to be located below the earth].
This is what the expression "many thousands of yojana" is meant to represent;
a special kind of cliff from which, once you fall, you must stay at the bottom
for a very long time. This too is a reason why you must make efforts in
applying the antidotes for the mental afflictions.

Here next is the discussion of why you must purify yourself quickly. This
section has two parts of its own: instructions to make efforts in applying the
antidotes to negative deeds, beginning today itself; and an explanation of why,
since there is no reason at all that we can feel free of the threat of suffering, it
is inappropriate to feel laziness about practicing the path.

,DE RING KHO NA MI 'CHI ZHES,
,BDE BAR 'DUG PA RIGS MA YIN,
,BDAG NI MED PAR 'GYUR BA'I DUS,
,DE NI GDON MI ZA BAR 'BYUNG ,
It is not right to relax and think,
"I will never die right now, today;"
For without a doubt the time will come
When you have disappeared.

Here is the first of the two. You might think to yourself, "Admittedly I should
make some efforts in applying the antidotes; but I think I will do so next
month, or perhaps next year." The correct thing to do though would be to
start making efforts today itself, because it is not something right to simply live
in laziness, and to relax without making any efforts towards the antidotes,
thinking to oneself, "I will never die right now, today." There is absolutely no
certainty though that you will not die today, and we can fairly say that, without
a doubt, the time that you have died and disappeared will come tomorrow. Thus
you should stop this tendency to be lazy, and begin to make your efforts today
itself.

It is just as the Epistle of Kanika states:
It's no good thing for a human being
Ever to say, "I'll do it tomorrow;"
The tomorrow when you are no longer here
Is a day that beyond any doubt will come.

,BDAG LA MI 'JIGS SU YIS BYIN,
,'DI LAS JI LTAR NGES THAR ZHES,
,GDON MI ZA BAR MED 'GYUR NA,
,JI LTAR BDAG YID BDE BAR 
Who was it that granted you the power not to fear?
How could you ever gain any certain freedom
That you would, beyond doubt, not disappear?
Why is it you sit there relaxed?

'DUG,GNYIS PA NI, 'CHI YANG 'JIGS PA BYAS PAS MI PHAN PAS 'JIGS MI DGOS SO ZHE NA, GZHAN THAMS CAD 'CHI BA MTHONG ZHING THOS LA SHI NAS NGAN 'GROR LHUNG BA'I 'JIGS PA YOD BZHIN DU BDAG LA 'CHI BA DANG SDIG PAS 'JIGS MI DGOS ZHES MI 'JIGS PA SKYES BU DAM PA SU YIS BYIN, STER PA PO SA YANG MED PAS GNYEN PO LA MA 'BAD NA SDIG PA DANG 'CHI BA 'DI LAS JI LTAR NGES PAR THAR PAR 'GYUR TE MI THAR PAS SHI NAS GDON MI ZA BAR MED PAR 'GYUR NA SDIG PA'I GNYEN PO LA MI 'BAD PAR CI'I PHYIR LE LO'I DBANG GIS BDAG YID BDE BAR 'DUG PA MI RIGS PAS LAM BSGOM PA LA 'BAD PAR BYA'O,
Here is the second point. You might then say, "Even if it's true that we're
going to die, it's no use to be afraid of it--there is no point to being
frightened." But you are here in the midst of the fear that comes from seeing
and hearing of the deaths of everyone else, and the fear that you might fall
into the lower realms. So who was it, what holy being, that blessed you and
granted you the power not to fear: to say that, despite all this, there is "no point
to being frightened," no need to fear death, or your own bad deeds? The fact
is that there is no being who could grant you any such power. So if you fail
to make efforts towards applying the antidotes, then how could you ever gain any
certain freedom from your negative deeds, and from death itself? You never
could be free. And then when you died you would, beyond any doubt, disappear.
So why is it that you fail to make any efforts in applying the antidotes, and
why is it that you sit there, relaxed, lost to the effects of laziness? It is wrong to
do so, and thus you should make every effort in practicing the path.
THE FORCE OF RESTRAINT

Next is our expanded explanation of the fourth of the four forces: the force of
restraining yourself from bad deeds in the future. Here there are three parts:
restraining yourself from negative actions because of your feelings of regret;

purifying yourself of what you have already done; and pledging to restrain
from negative actions, which is done once you have requested holy beings to
listen to your resolution. There are two sections to the first of these parts:
giving up bad deeds, which are meaningless; and making efforts, day and
night, to practice the methods for freeing oneself from negative actions.
The first section has two steps of its own: why being attached to your
possessions is so inappropriate, since they are in no way reliable; and why it
is wrong to be attached to relatives and the like. Here is the first.

,SNGON CHAD MYONG STE ZHIG PA LAS,

,BDAG NI DE LA MNGON ZHEN NAS,

And what further do you have?
All because of your craving for these,
You've acted against your Lama's wishes.

All of the possessions which you have enjoyed up to this point in the cycle of
suffering have been unreliable; that is, they have fallen apart. And can we say
that, among those possessions which you still have now, there are any further
ones which have any essence? No, none at all. And yet, all because of your
craving and attachment for these objects with no essence, you have acted against
the wishes of your Lama, and committed negative deeds. You must feel regret
for this.

,GSON TSE 'DI DANG DE BZHIN DU,
,GNYEN DANG BSHES PA RNAM SPANGS NAS,
,GCIG BU GA SHED 'GRO DGOS NA,
,MDZA' DANG MI MDZA' KUN CI RUNG ,
You will give up this, that was
While you lived, and just so
With friends and relatives;
Then go on alone to who knows where.

Your friends or enemies?

Here is the second point. You are going to have to give up everything: this
body that you have here, while you are alive, and just so your friends and relatives
as well. And then you will have to go on alone, to "who knows where;" that is, to
a place which you cannot now know for sure. And so what is the use of any of
your friends or enemies? They can be of no help at all, and thus it is wrong for
you to feel any attachment for them.

,MI DGE BA LAS SDUG BSNGAL 'BYUNG ,
,DE LAS JI LTAR NGES THAR ZHES,
,NYIN MTSAN RTAG TU BDAG GIS NI,
,'DI NYID 'BA' ZHIG BSAM PA'I RIGS,
Suffering comes from negative actions;
It is fitting that you spend all your time,
Day and night, devoted to only
This contemplation, and think to yourself:
"How can I gain definite freedom?"

Here next is the point about making efforts night and day. The suffering of the
hells and the like all comes from negative actions such as taking life. As such it
is fitting that you spend all your time, day and night, devoted only to this
contemplation of good and bad deeds, of the principles of actions and their
consequences, thinking to yourself, "How can I gain definite freedom from all these
sufferings?" If you are unable to find with certainty, if you are unable to
contemplate deep within your heart, the principles of actions and their
consequences, then you will never be able to grasp with any certainty, with
any of the kind of certainty which pleases the victorious Buddhas, any spiritual
teaching at all.
Therefore it is right that you make great efforts in all these things. There are
certain people who claim to have reached the point where they grasp
emptiness clearly, and who still do not consider the principles of actions and
their consequences to be of any importance. This is obviously a complete
misunderstanding, and reflects a failure to grasp clearly the fact that emptiness
is a reflection of dependent origination.

Here next is the part about purifying yourself of what you have already done.
We proceed in two steps, concerning the thing it is that you purify, and then
the way in which you purify yourself of it. You are purifying yourself first of
those deeds which are wrong by nature: those that are negative actions no matter
who commits them; that is, regardless of whether the person in question is one
with vows or not. And secondly there are the deeds which are wrong because
the Buddha has forbidden them: those which are wrong only for those who have
taken vows. What you are purifying yourself of is whichever of these you may
have committed; in short, you are purifying yourself of any bad deed at all that
you may ever have committed, out of your lack of understanding and your dark
ignorance, your failure to grasp, the principles of actions and their consequences.

To purify these deeds you stand here in the direct presence of the Protectors, before
the Buddhas and their sons and daughters; you express yourself by joining your
palms at your breast. In your thoughts you develop a sense of fear for suffering.
And then you prostrate, over and over again, and undertake thus to purify yourself
of all these negative actions.

Next is the pledge to restrain ourselves. For this reason I make the following
request to the Guides: "The bad deeds I have committed are mistakes, and I ask you
to consider them mistakes. The bad things I have done are nothing good, and from
this moment on, even at the cost of my life, I will never commit any single one of
them at all, ever again." By doing so we stop the flow of our bad deeds, and
restrain ourselves from them again.

The teachings of the Buddha, and the commentaries upon them, present a great
number of ways in which we can clean ourselves of our bad deeds. The one
antidote which is totally complete though is this purification, this practice of
using all four forces together to do the purifying. It is stated in a number of
scriptures--for example, in the Blaze of Reasoning and in the Great Commentary
to the Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Verses--that this practice can erase
even those bad deeds which are definite to lead to the experience of a karmic
result.

People like you and I have no great knowledge of the various laws of actions
and their consequences. Even that very little bit which we do understand we
are unable to put into practice as we should. Every single day then we commit
negative actions in a great variety of different ways. Because of this we must
follow the path of purifying ourselves of our bad deeds on a continual basis.
And we should make efforts in the practice especially with the intention of
purifying ourselves of those thoughts and actions which block us from being
able to develop the true wish for enlightenment.

I was crushed by the mistake
Of being filled with the arrogance
Of deluded desire and jealousy,
And it kept me from reaching
The highest wish of all.

From the depths of my heart,

That I may have made
In thought or word or deed.

Here is the second major section, which is actually acquiring the wish for
enlightenment, once you have already assembled the conducive conditions for
its development: rejoicing in good deeds, and so on. This section has two

parts, which are an explanation of the text of the chapter, and then a note on
the name of the chapter. There are three steps to the first of these two parts:
what to do for the preliminaries, for the main stage, and then for the
conclusion. The preliminaries are five--rejoicing in good deeds; urging
teachers to turn the wheel of the Dharma; requesting holy beings not to pass
into "nirvana;" dedicating good deeds; and, as a step towards the practice of
the perfection of wisdom, cultivating the state of mind in which we give up
our bodies, our possessions, and the power of all the good we have done.
REJOICING
Rejoicing we will cover in three steps: rejoicing in those good deeds which act
as a cause for birth in the higher realms, and in the result they cause; rejoicing
in good deeds which act as a cause for freedom alone, and in the result they
cause; and rejoicing in good deeds which act as a cause for unsurpassed
enlightenment, and in the result which they cause.

I rejoice, with joy, in the virtuous deeds
Which relieve the torment of the lower realms
For every being; and in the fact
That these suffering beings could ever come
To live in happiness.

Here is the first of the three. I rejoice in the good deeds which act as a cause to
help relieve the torment of the lower realms for every being in the cycle of suffering;
and I rejoice as well in those which act as a cause for all of them to achieve a
very special form of birth in the higher realms. I also rejoice in the result

which these causes bring about: I rejoice in the fact that these suffering beings
could ever come to live in the happiness of the higher realms. How do I rejoice?
I think to myself, with thoughts of joy, about what a wonderful thing it is that
these good deeds exist in the world.

Good deeds which act as enlightenment's cause.

From the sufferings of cyclic life.

Here is the second. I also rejoice in the fact that beings have collected together
good deeds such as those which are consistent with reaching freedom: those
deeds which act as a cause for the enlightenment of the listeners and self-made
Buddhas. I rejoice as well in the result which these good deeds bring about: the
certain freedom from the sufferings of cyclic life which living creatures can attain
through these deeds--that is, I rejoice in the fact that they will achieve nirvana.

So too I rejoice in the enlightenment
Of those who protect, and in the levels
Of the sons and daughters.
I rejoice with gladness in the ocean
Of the goodness of the wish for enlightenment
Which brings every living being to happiness;
I rejoice too in what they undertake
To help all living kind.

Here is the third. So too I rejoice in the total enlightenment which has been
reached by those who protect all other living beings; and in the ten levels which
the different sons and daughters of the victorious Buddhas have attained. I
rejoice as well in the causes for all these states, in the veritable ocean of the
goodness of the wish for enlightenment: the thought to attain highest
enlightenment in order to bring every living being to happiness. Beyond this I
rejoice in the actual deeds of the beings with this wish: in the activities they
undertake to help all living kind. I rejoice, with gladness, and I dwell in the faith
of admiration, which is mixed in my mind with feelings of great happiness.

Here is the second. I think of all the Buddhas in every corner of the universe who
have only recently achieved their Buddhahood, and who have yet to teach the
Dharma. Physically I join my palms at my breast and, with great respect, make
supplication to them. What is the goal of my supplication? I request them to light
the lamp of the Dharma, of both the Dharma in the minds of people and the
Dharma in the form of words, in order to illuminate the path which frees every
living being from wandering confused in suffering and the darkness of ignorance.

Here is the third point. I also join my palms at my breast and make supplication
to those Victorious Ones who have determined to pass on into "nirvana." All these
living beings are blinded--their eyes of wisdom are blinded--by ignorance, and
I beg the Victors not to leave them in this condition: I ask them to remain for
countless eons, so that they might remove from these beings the darkness of
ignorance.

Here is the third. I pray as well that there falls a shower of food and drink--that
is, a whole variety of sustenance and refreshment--all with the power to
remove every kind of harm in the form of hunger or thirst. There are three
types of intermediate eons, and one of them is the intermediate eon of famine. I
pray that, whenever this kind of eon arrives, I may become food and drink, and thus
be able to remove the hunger and thirst of every living creature who needs me.

they need. I pray that I can become anything they need and want, an entire range
of different necessities for life, and then appear before their very eyes, without any
effort at all to make it happen.

Course X: Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life, Part I
Reading Six: Taking Joy
The following reading is taken from the Entry Point for Children of the Victorious
Buddhas (rGyal-sras 'jug-ngogs), a commentary by Gyaltsab Je Darma Rinchen
(1364-1432) on the book called Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life (Byang-chub-
sems-dpa'i spyod-pa la 'jug-pa) by Master Shantideva (c. 700 AD).

The third part in our explanation of the actual body of the third chapter of the
Guide is the conclusion. Here there are two sections: practicing the taking of
joy yourself, and bringing joy to others. The first of these has two sections of
its own: how the wish achieves your own goals, and how it achieves the goals
of others. The first of these will come in three steps: taking joy by uplifting
your heart; practicing care once your have attained the wish; and practicing the
taking of joy, over having attained a wish that is very hard to find.

With great devotion, and in conclusion
Lift up their hearts, in the following manner,
To engage in an ever increasing way.

Those of intelligence, meaning bodhisattvas, should in this way then attain the two
forms of the wish for enlightenment, and attain it so it is firm, through thoughts
that are filled with great devotion, and gladness, and faith. And they should
then, in conclusion, undertake as well a method to keep this state of mind from
being lost, and to increase it ever further. It is in order to engage in this state
of mind in an ever increasing way that your should take joy, and uplift your heart,
in the following manner. [The Entry Point seems to read 'jug here for mjug by
mistake.]

How is it that we uplift our hearts? With this moment--that is, at the point
where I develop the wish and take the vows--my life has become fruitful; now
I have truly achieved a human life, in the sense that I have given meaning to the
spiritual leisure and fortune with which I was born. Today I have been born into
the family of the Buddhas: I have become a bodhisattva. Practice the feeling of
gladness, thinking to yourself, "Now I have become a child of the Buddhas"--for
this is the prayer wherein one thinks to oneself, "When is it that I will become
a child of the Buddhas?"

Here is the second point. You may wonder whether this act alone is enough.
It is not, for you must then make the resolution: "Now, no matter what, I will
undertake only those actions of the three doors which are fitting for those who belong
to the family of my new fathers, the Buddhas. I will keep my family one which
is holy, one which is at all times--in the beginning, and during, and at the end
of any action--forever made beautiful: faultless, and filled only with wonderful

qualities. I will make every effort I can to assure that my mind is never defiled
by breaking my vows--the rules that have been set forth for those that are
following the wish both in the form of a prayer, and in the form of action.

Here is the third point. Suppose a poor and penniless beggar were to find some
precious jewel in a pile of garbage. I am just the same, for by "dumb luck"--that is,
through simple good fortune--I have been able to develop this precious wish for
enlightenment. It is surely only something that has happened through the
miraculous power of the Enlightened Ones.

How the wish achieves the goals of others we will cover in three steps as well,
describing how it has the power to remove the sufferings of living beings, how
it has the power to remove the obstacles that cause these sufferings, and finally
how it has the power to accomplish all help and happiness. The first of these
three has five parts of its own: descriptions of how the wish destroys the Lord

of Death within every living being; how it destroys poverty; how it destroys
illness; how it destroys the general suffering of the cycle of life; and, more
particularly, how it destroys the sufferings of the lower realms.

Here is the first of the five. There is a supreme nectar of deathlessness, one which
acts to destroy the Lord of Death within every living being--which stops this
condition of having helplessly to die. And the nectar is this wish for
enlightenment, because it leads us to the state where there is no aging, and no
death.
 , 'GRO BA'I DBUL BA SEL BA YI,
,MI ZAD GTER YANG 'DI YIN NO,
This same wish is an endless
Treasure house which removes
The poverty of every living thing.

Here is the second. There is as well an endless treasure house which removes the
poverty of every living thing, for it grants never-endingly a wealth of both
material things and the Dharma. The treasure too is this same wish for
enlightenment.

,'GRO BA'I NAD RAB ZHI BYED PA'I,

This same wish is a supreme medicine
Which puts a final end

Here is the third. There is a supreme medicine which puts a final end to every
illness of living kind, and it too is this same wish.

,SRID LAM 'KHYAM ZHING DUB PA YI,

Here is the fourth. There is a great tree which provides a cool spot that refreshes
and clears away the sufferings of all those beings who have tired themselves by
wandering along the road of the cycle of existence. This too is the wish.

,'GRO BA THAMS CAD NGAN 'GRO LAS,

Here is the fifth. There is a great span, a bridge, that allows all living beings to
escape from the lower realms. This too is the wish.

,'GRO BA'I NYON MONGS GDUNG SEL BA'I,

The power of removing obstacles we will cover in two parts: how the wish
removes the obstacles that are mental afflictions, and then how it removes the
obstacles to total knowledge. Here is the first. The wish for enlightenment is
a moon that rises in the mind, to clear away with its cool light all the heat of the
mental afflictions, which torment living creatures. This is because it has the power
to destroy each and every one of the obstacles which are mental afflictions.

,'GRO BA'I MI SHES RAB RIB

The wish is a great sun

Here is the second part. The wish is also a great sun that rises to obliterate--that
is, to rip out from its roots--the cataracts of the obstacles to total knowledge in
every living being: the lack of knowledge which is not directly related to the mental

afflictions. This is because the state of wisdom which perceives emptiness, and
which is further enhanced by great accumulations of good deeds, functions to
terminate completely the very seeds of the obstacles to total knowledge.

Here thirdly is how the wish achieves the goals of others, in two stages of how
it brings about every kind of benefit, and how it brings about every kind of
happiness. This wish for enlightenment is the very essence, something that has
been distilled from the great ocean of the milk of the holy Dharma, the highest of
all spoken words. It has been distilled through the process of churning this
milk with the great paddle of wisdom which has come from listening and
contemplation. It is like a great heap of the very essence of butter, a butter that
has a special nutritional value, in that it can help everything of any kind of
benefit at all to grow. As such, everyone should make efforts to reach this
state of mind.

Sentient beings are travelers

Hoping to win pleasant experiences.
This wish remains the highest method
Of all for happiness: it brings

Every living being.

Here is the second point. Sentient beings are like travelers who are wandering
in the cycle of suffering: they wander here and there along the roads of the three
realms, and hope to win all the pleasant experiences of a birth among humans, or
the pleasure beings. It is this wish for enlightenment which remains the highest
method of all for achieving happiness: it brings satisfaction to all these travelers, every
living being. This is because it allows all living kind to reach the higher realms,
and definite goodness.

come here as my guest, for I will serve them to their heart's content the very state
of Those Who have Gone to Bliss: the ultimate culmination of every kind of help
and happiness. And until they reach this state I offer them as well to partake, to
their own satisfaction, all the happiness that can be found among humans and
pleasure beings. And once I have made this invitation, I ask others to take joy
as well: I call on every pleasure being, and near pleasure being, and serpent-like

As Master Shantideva's text explains, there are certain preliminaries that must
be fulfilled before one can develop the wish for enlightenment. We must
purify ourselves of the obstacles which are factors that work against being able
to develop the wish, and we must gather together all the factors that are
conducive to reaching it. You should understand that this process, of
undertaking all the preliminaries and then reaching the wish itself, is the very
highest way of all to get the essence out of having achieved this human body
and mind, with all their spiritual leisure and fortune. As such we must make
great efforts in the practice of these preliminaries.

All those ones of intelligence
Who have reached a body
With spiritual leisure and fortune

The two forms of the wish,
For this is the essential point

The third part, which is taking care to eliminate the mental afflictions, has
three divisions: considering the problems of mental afflictions; the reasons why
it is wrong to feel discouraged over any hardships one may have to put up
with during the process of eliminating the mental afflictions; and practicing the
emotion of joy over the fact that, should one make serious efforts to eliminate
them, the mental afflictions really are something that can be eliminated
completely.

The first of these divisions has three parts of its own: considering how the
mental afflictions hurt us; reasons why it is wrong to tolerate the mental
afflictions; and developing courage for the task of destroying the afflictions.
There are four separate steps to the process of considering how the mental
afflictions hurt us: thinking about how they leave us powerless; how they send
us to unthinkable suffering; how the time that they hurt us is infinite; and the
reasons why it is wrong to make friends with the mental afflictions.

Our great enemies--"anger and desire and the rest," which incorporates all the
primary and secondary mental afflictions--are not some kind of creatures with
hands or legs, that could carry weapons in their hands, or the like. Neither are
they great warriors, full of energy, or wily masters who can find clever ways to
get what they want. So how did it happen, that these mental afflictions have made
me powerless, like I were their slave?

Here is the second point. The mental afflictions live in my mind, and at their
absolute will they hurt me, and drag me to the sufferings of the lower realms,
and other kinds of pain. It's completely wrong that I should tolerate them, and not
feel anger for them: my patience with them is a disgrace. Therefore I should see the
mental afflictions as my foe, and make great efforts to stop them. We should
exert ourselves in studying the definitions, divisions, causes, functions, and
other details of the mental afflictions, as presented in the treatises on higher
knowledge. Most importantly we must think over and over again about the
problems which the afflictions bring to us.

Suppose the mighty pleasure beings, and near pleasure beings, all rose together as
one to be my enemy. Still they would never be able to lead me to the fires of the hell
called "No Respite," and throw me into the fires, so long as I could prevent
myself from falling under the power of the mental afflictions. Just one of my
great enemies though, one instance of a powerful mental affliction within my own
mind, can in a single instant throw me into the fires of this same hell, into fires
which are so powerful that--if the great Mount Meru were to brush against them
slightly--it would be totally destroyed, and not even dust would remain. Thus
I should make great efforts to smash this enemy, the enemy of everything
related to the mental afflictions.

Here is the third point. Consider now another problem with the mental
afflictions. This great enemy of mine, the mental afflictions, can live for a very long
time: for time without beginning or end. But there is not a one of my other enemies,
none of the worldly ones, who can live so long. If I apply the various antidotes for
everything related to the mental afflictions only occasionally, nothing will
change at all. Thus I must not only make great efforts to destroy the mental
afflictions, but I must do so continuously, in a steady stream like a great river
of water.

The other kinds of enemies--that is, the worldly ones--all befriend you, and
look to help you and make you happy, if you make an effort to relate to them and serve
them in a friendly way, with food and the like. The mental-affliction enemies
though are different: if you try to relate to them, or get friendly with them, then
they become stronger and stronger; and then they turn on you, and hurt you,
bring you pain. The best way to help yourself then is to concentrate on this one
task: destroying them completely.

There are two parts to the explanation of why it is wrong to tolerate the mental
afflictions: considering how they hurt the mind, and considering how they hurt
the body. Here is the first. They--the mental afflictions--have been thus my
constant enemy for a very long time, for time with no beginning: they are the one
single and matchless cause that feeds and nourishes the entire mass of harmful
things, of suffering and all the rest. How could it ever happen then, so long as
these afflictions are rooted and fixed in my very heart, that I could ever reach any
point where I was free of all the terrors of cyclic life, and feel any kind of gladness?
Happiness would be an impossibility. I must therefore make true efforts in
destroying my mental afflictions.

Here is how the afflictions hurt the body. The mental afflictions prevent you
from getting beyond the cycle of life, and so they are guards for the prison of
cyclic life--they throw you into the dungeon of the hells and all the like. They are
also butchers that kill you, whether you are living in the lower realms, or the
higher realms. How could it ever be possible then that I could ever have a
moment's happiness, so long as these mental afflictions are living in the net of

desire that stays in my mind--that is, so long as they exist among the
misimpressions within my thoughts? The answer is that I never could have
a moment's happiness, in my body or my mind.

Each and every thing which ever happens that I don't want is caused by
something related to the mental afflictions. Therefore the right thing for me to
do is to exert myself, without letting up in my effort even for a moment, until such
time as I have directly, and finally, destroyed this terrible enemy. Even in the
everyday world, in temporary situations such as where someone does me some
minor harm, does no more than say a few hard words to me, I immediately feel
anger, and then some kind of pride comes where I begin to dwell on hard
feelings for the person, and then do whatever I can to ruin this enemy, and
don't even stop to sleep until I do so. If I act this way with worldly enemies then
it is completely appropriate then that I make great efforts to smash the other
enemy, the mental afflictions.

Here next is the second general division, on the reasons why we should never
be discouraged by the hardships necessary to destroy the afflictions. This
division has three parts of its own: putting on armor that allows us to destroy
the mental afflictions, and refusing to be discouraged by any hardships that
this effort brings us; considering the benefits of making every effort to destroy
the afflictions; and a description of why it is therefore completely proper to
exert ourselves in actually undertaking to destroy the mental afflictions.

There are poor deluded ones who are willing to suffer
For those who are going to die by their very nature;
They advance to war with fanatical hopes of destroying:
Completely ignoring the pain of being hit,
Never to turn back, never to withdraw from the field,
Until they have achieved their aim.
With the true enemy, an enemy who is an enemy by nature,
Who is the cause of all of our sufferings, all the time,
There is no need to say that I must be the same.
Whatever comes, I must never become discouraged,
I must never lessen in my resolve,
Even if it brings me hundreds of sufferings.

Here is the first. There are those "poor deluded ones," meaning people who are
worthy of our pity, who are willing to suffer to kill those who are going to die by
their very nature; that is, who will die by themselves anyway, without anyone
having to kill them. These people "advance to war," meaning they go to fight
in a war, with fanatical hopes of destroying their enemy. They are so intent on
this goal that they completely ignore whatever suffering is inflicted upon
themselves, the pain of being hit by some weapon like an arrow or spear. They
have decided never to turn back, never to withdraw from the field, until they have
achieved their aim of destroying their opponent. We on the other hand are faced
with enemies that are the cause of all of our sufferings, all the time. They are the
true enemy, a pure enemy: an enemy who is an enemy by nature, and who has
always been so, from the moment we were born. There is no need to say that I
must be the same as those other fighters: I must never become discouraged, never
lessen in my resolve, never lose my warrior's heart, no matter what hardships I
may have to face in the task of destroying this enemy. I must bear with
whatever comes, even if it brings me hundreds of sufferings such as cold, hunger,

efforts until I have been able to subdue the enemy of the mental afflictions.

The second part has three sections of its own: how it is right to bear with
hardships for the reason that they are a cause for the culmination of my own
goals; how it is right to bear with them for the reason that they are a cause for
the culmination of the goals of others; and the reasons why I must bring to a
final end the pledge I have made before.

A person treasures even the mark of a wound
Meaninglessly put there by an enemy.
So why should we consider a problem
The pain we feel in our quest
To attain a very great purpose?

Here is the first. Consider how, in the everyday world, a person treasures, like
some ornament for their body, even the mark of a wound that was put there by an
enemy for some meaningless reason, over some insignificant thing, and then
shows it off to other people, saying "This is how I got this one..." We, on the
other hand, have undergone some kind of hardship, some kind of pain, for a
very great purpose: that is, in our quest to attain total enlightenment. Why should
we consider these pains then a problem? We should rather embrace them, for
they can only help us.

Here is the second point. Consider now fishermen, who make their living by
killing fish; butchers, the slaughter-house workers who are by tradition
considered an inferior caste; farmers, those who make their living through
tending the earth; and the like. Even they endure willingly all kinds of harms, such
as cold or heat, thinking of nothing more important than their livelihood. Why then
should someone like myself not be able to endure hardships for the sake of bringing
about every sort of happiness for all living beings? I should endure them.

You have pledged yourself to free all living beings
In the ten different directions from their mental afflictions.
At the same time you have failed to free you yourself
From your own mental afflictions,
Are you not some kind of madman then,
To say so while you've failed to judge your own level?

Here is the third point. Someone might make the following statement: "I admit
that I am a person who has agreed to undertake the destruction of the mental
afflictions within the minds of other persons. It would be wrong though for
me to work to destroy the mental afflictions in my own mind, because if I
succeeded in doing so I would have fallen into what is called the 'extreme of
personal peace.'" You have though pledged yourself, and developed the wish, to
free all living beings, beings as vast in extent as the ten different directions of space
itself, from their mental afflictions. If at the same time you have failed to free you
yourself from all your own mental afflictions, then you have failed even in the
endeavor of accomplishing all your own needs, much less those of others. Are
you not some kind of madman then, to say that you are going to free every other
living being from their mental afflictions, while at the very same moment you
have failed completely to judge your own level--the fact that you yourself are still
at the mercy of your own mental afflictions? No one chained in the cycle of
suffering of life themselves could ever accomplish all the goals of other living
beings, and so you should rather make efforts to destroy the mental afflictions
within your own mind.

The third section, on why it is right to make great efforts to destroy the mental
afflictions, has two parts: making efforts in applying the antidotes to the
mental afflictions, and making efforts never to become controlled by the mental
afflictions.

I should therefore never turn back
Even for a single moment from the task
Of destroying the mental afflictions.
I should get attached to them,
And learn to hate and make war.
These kinds of mental afflictions
Act to destroy the mental afflictions
And so are not counted among them.

Here is the first of the two. The mental afflictions are, therefore, things which
deserve to be eliminated. As such, I should never turn back, either in my
thoughts or my actions, from the task of destroying them, even for a single moment.
I should get attached to these antidotes for the mental afflictions; that is, I should
make use of the antidotes. And I should learn to hate the mental afflictions, and
make war on them, and smash them.

Someone may ask the following question: "You seem to be describing some
kind of bias in the attitude we should have towards the antidotes that
eliminate our mental afflictions, and you have spoken about hating the thing
that the antidote is supposed to eliminate. Aren't these types of thoughts
themselves just another kind of mental affliction--that is, the very thing which
we are trying to eliminate?" These kinds of attitudes--of being attached to the
antidotes for mental affliction, and of hating the mental afflictions we are
trying to eliminate--are themselves only apparent mental afflictions. Because
they are included into the antidote side--that is, because they are part of what

acts to destroy the mental afflictions--they are not counted among the objects which
we seek to eliminate from our minds. There are commentaries which do state
that these are themselves something to be destroyed later, but what they mean
by saying this is that, once one has finished off all the objects to be eliminated,
one need no longer make war.

You can tie me to a stake and burn me, kill me,
Or you can cut off my head--that would be fine.
But I will never in any shape or form submit
To my great enemy, the mental afflictions.

Here is the second. Someone may ask another question: "Wouldn't it be easier
just to cooperate with the mental afflictions, rather than possibly having to
undergo infinite thousands of sufferings during the task of eliminating them?"
You can tie me to a stake and burn me, kill me. Or you can cut off my head--that
would be fine. The only thing that would happen is that I would lose the body
which I possess in this life. But I will never in any shape or form submit to--that
is, I will never allow myself to come under the control of--my great enemy, the
mental afflictions: those things which create the great sufferings of the hells and
such, those things which block me from reaching the goals I hope for.

The third section from before describes how we should take joy in the fact that,
if we make efforts, the mental afflictions can be removed. Here there are three
parts: describing how, if we are able to eradicate the mental afflictions
completely from our minds, they have nowhere else to go; how, because the
mental afflictions spring from a cause which is a misperception, they really can
be eliminated if we make great efforts; and how, if they are eradicated
completely, there could be nowhere else for them to go at all--and should thus
be eliminated.

GI,NYON MONGS DGRA TSUL DE DANG 'DRA MA YIN,
If you push a normal enemy out of your country,
They can still go on to other lands,
Make their home there, and get reinforcements;
And then they can return.
The way in which the mental afflictions behave
As enemies though is not the same.

Here is the first of the three. "Still," one may begin, "it would be better to
simply coexist with the mental afflictions, because if they are like normal
enemies in the everyday world, they can--if you remove them from the mind
one time--go back and regroup, then return to hurt you again." But they are
not the same as normal enemies. If you push a normal enemy, a worldly enemy,
out of your country one time, they can still go on to other lands, stay there, make
their home there, and then regroup--get reinforcements. Then they can return to
seek revenge upon you. The way in which the mental afflictions behave as enemies
though is not the same. Once you eradicate them completely from your mind,
there is nowhere else for them to go, and it is completely impossible for them
to regroup and return.

,NYON MONGS NYON MONGS SHES RAB MIG GIS SPANG,
,BDAG YID LAS BSAL GANG DU 'GRO BAR 'GYUR,
,GANG DU GNAS NAS BDAG GNOD BYA PHYIR 'ONG ,
,BLO ZHAN BDAG LA BRTZON PA MED PAR ZAD,
The mental afflictions are such that
Once I have eliminated them,
Cleared them from my mind
By using the eye of wisdom,
They have nowhere else to go--
No place they can make their home,
No way to return and harm me.
It all comes down to the fact
That my mind is so very weak:
I do not have the energy.

Here is the second point. The mental afflictions are such that, once I have
managed to eradicate them from my mind a single time, they have nowhere
to stay. I should therefore make efforts in using the eye of wisdom--the
perception of emptiness--to eliminate the seed of the mental afflictions: for
everything related to mental affliction springs from a root which is a
misperception. Once I have eliminated these seeds, once I have cleared the
mental afflictions away from my mind in this way, they have nowhere else at all
to go, no place they can make their home, no place to regroup, no way to return to
do me harm--it would be a complete impossibility.
Even though this is the case, the mental afflictions do continue to hurt me, and
it all comes down to the fact that my mind is so very weak: I do not even have the
energy to throw the mental afflictions out even the single time that would be
needed.

It's not true that the mental afflictions
Exist among objects, neither do they exist
Among the group of the powers,
Nor somewhere throughout, nor somewhere other.
There is nowhere at all that they can stay
To do harm to every living being.
They are like an illusion, and so
I should eliminate this fear from my heart,
And rely on the practice of making great efforts,
Working to develop wisdom.
Why should I subject myself pointlessly
To the pains of the hells and the rest?

KYANG GZUGS MTHONG BA LA SOGS PA'I TSE NA NYON MONGS SKYE BAR THAL BA'I PHYIR RO,
Here is the third point. Someone else might come and assert the following:
"We could never be able to eliminate mental afflictions even once, because they
grow with the mind itself, and exist as part of the very nature of things." It's
not true that the mental afflictions exist by nature among the objects which we
perceive: visual objects and the rest. If this were the case, then mental
afflictions would start to grow even in enemy destroyers, as they looked upon
visual objects and such.

,MIG LA SOGS PA'I DBANG PO'I TSOGS LA YANG DE LTAR GNAS PA MIN TE, GNAS LUGS KYI DON SEMS PA'I TSE MIG YOD KYANG NYON MONGS MA DMIGS PA'I PHYIR RO,
Neither do the mental afflictions exist in this way among the group of the physical
powers, such as the eye. This is because a person who is directing his or her
thoughts towards the meaning of the actual reality of things may still possess
the power of the eye, and yet not have any mental affliction.

,DE DAG GI BAR NA'ANG GNAS PA MIN LA DE LAS GZHAN NA'ANG GNAS PA MIN NA LAN CIG RTZA BA NAS PHYUNG BA DANG RANG BZHIN GYIS GRUB PA 'DI DAG GAR GNAS NAS 'GRO BA KUN LA GNOD PA BYED DE GANG DU YANG MI GNAS PA'I PHYIR RO,
Nor do the mental afflictions exist somewhere throughout these two possibilities,
nor somewhere other than the two: once you have eradicated them from their
very root, there is nowhere at all that they can stay: that they can by some kind
of nature go and remain, to return then to do harm to every living being.

,NYON MONGS 'DI NI RANG BZHIN GYIS GRUB PAS STONG BZHIN DU RANG BZHIN GYIS GRUB PAR SNANG BA SGYU MA DANG 'DRA BA DE'I DUS RANG BZHIN GYIS GRUB PAS RTZA BA NAS SPONG MI NUS SNYAM DU SNYING LA 'JIGS PA SPONG LA STONG NYID RTOGS PA'I SHES RAB BSKYED NAS NYON MONGS SPANG BA'I PHYIR BRTZON PA BSTEN PAR RIGS KYI DE LTAR NUS BZHIN DU DON MED PA NYID DU BDAG LA DMYAL BA LA SOGS PA'I NGAN SONG RNAMS SU CI STE GNOD PA BYED DU 'JUG STE 'JUG PAR MI RIGS SO, , SNGA MA RNAMS SA BON PHYUNG NA GNAS DE DAG TU MI GNAS PA LA YANG BSHAD DO,
One might have the following thought: "These mental afflictions are empty of
any natural kind of existence, but at the same time they do appear to have
natural existence, and so they are like an illusion. As long as this is the
case--because they do exist through some nature of their own--I could never
eliminate them from their root." It is good though if I can eliminate this fear
from my heart, and rely on the practice of making great efforts to remove my mental
afflictions, through working to develop the wisdom which perceives emptiness.
Given that I therefore have at the present moment the ability to remove these
afflictions, it is not good on the other hand that I subject myself pointlessly to the
sufferings of the lower realms, to hells and the rest. Why should I put myself
through these pains? Some commentators have also explained the previous
lines as referring to the fact that, once we remove the seeds for the mental
afflictions, they can no longer stay in these various places.

In this way we must engage in different
Kinds of contemplations and make great efforts
For the purpose of accomplishing the rules
As they have been described.

To be treated with specific kinds of medicine--

Here is the third overall section, which is the summary of the chapter. In this
way--that is, as explained above--we must engage in contemplations of many
kinds, and make great efforts in the practice of carefulness, just as the Teacher has
taught us to do, for the purpose of accomplishing the ends of both the wish for
enlightenment, and the various rules for bodhisattvas, as they have been described
earlier. Suppose you were sick, but refused to listen to the advice of your
physician. How then could you ever be cured, if you were a patient who absolutely
had to be treated with specific kinds of medicine? I would never be cured.
Therefore we must exert ourselves in the task of eliminating our mental
afflictions, just as that Great Physician, the Teacher, has taught us to do.

The second section, a demonstration that the fine qualities depend on the mind,
has six different parts, consisting of an explanation of how giving, an ethical
way of life, not getting angry, joyful effort, meditation, and finally wisdom
each depend on the mind.

We will present the first of these in two steps of its own: a demonstration of
the fact that the culmination of the perfection of giving does not depend on
removing the poverty of each and every living being; and an explanation of
how one can reach the final end of a generous state of mind through continual
practice.

Suppose something were the perfection
Of giving when it removed
The poverty of every living being.
If there were living beings though
Who suffered still from hunger,
How then could the Protectors of
The past have reached the perfection?

Here is the first. Suppose someone were to assert the following: "We can posit
something as the perfection of giving when the culmination of this perfection of
giving results in removing the poverty of each and every living being." If though
there were living beings who still suffered from hunger, and there are, how then
could the Protectors of the past, the Buddhas, ever have reached the culmination
of the perfection of giving? It would be illogical.

It was spoken that the perfection
Of giving is the thought
To give all that one has,
Along with the results,
To every living being.
This then is the reason why
It's the state of mind alone.

Here is the second point, which is a kind of summary: "Therefore it was spoken
that the culmination of the perfection of giving occurs when one has perfectly
accustomed oneself to the kind of thought where one wishes to give all that one

has--one's body, one's possessions, and the total sum of one's good deeds,
along with the power of the virtue that results from giving these things

The second part, on the ethical way of life, has two sections of its own: a
demonstration that it would be incorrect to say that the culmination of the
perfection of an ethical life depends on the final end of any living being who
is being killed; and that the culmination of the perfection comes from constant
practice of the attitude of wanting to give up harm to others.

,NYA LA SOGS PA GANG ZHIG TU,

To a place where no one could kill them?

Here is the first point. It must be incorrect to say that the culmination of the
perfection of an ethical life should depend on trying to reach the end of the last
living being who is being killed. Because how could you ever chase every wild
beast, and every fish, and every other such being to some place where no one could
kill any of them? You never could.

,SPONG BA'I SEMS NI THOB PA LAS,
,TSUL KHRIMS PHA ROL PHYIN PAR BSHAD,
It is explained that the perfection
Of an ethical way of life consists of
Attaining a way of thinking wherein
One wishes to abandon.

Here is the second. Therefore, for this reason, it is explained in sutra that the
culmination of the perfection of an ethical way of life consists of attaining the
culmination of the constant practice of a way of thinking wherein one wishes to
abandon any idea of harming someone else, or of stealing anything. The sutra
at this point says, "What is the perfection of an ethical way of life? It is the
way of thinking in which one abandons anything that is harmful to others."

The third part, on the perfection of patience, has three sections: the point, a
metaphor, and the connection between the point and the metaphor. Here is
the first. You have reached the culmination of patience with the destruction of
a single object--the thought of anger, which is comparable to destroying each and
every one of your external enemies. You would have to admit that the
culmination of this perfection is not something that depends on finishing off
every possible object which could make you angry though, because it would be
a complete, or entire, impossibility ever to accomplish the destruction of every
single irritating person, for these are as limitless in extent as space itself.
Therefore patience is also something that depends upon the mind.

Here is the second point. Suppose you decided to cover the entire surface of
Earth with leather, in order to prevent the thorns and so on there from hurting
your feet. How could you ever find enough leather to do so? Even in this case
you would simply wrap your own feet in enough leather to cover the area of
the soles of your feet, in order to keep the thorns and such from hurting you.
This would be comparable then to covering the entire surface of the Earth with
leather.

Here is the third part. My present case is the same as this metaphor. It would
be an impossibility for me to stop every single outer object that might bring me any
kind of pain. Rather I should stop this tendency of my own mind to focus on these
same objects and then feel anger. It is through the constant practice of this
action that I could eventually bring patience to its culmination. Why though
should I try to stop all the other objects, everything that could ever make me
angry? I never could, and there is no need even to try.

A single instance of clear mind
Can as a result lead you

Along these same lines the related actions
Of body and speech are unable to give
A result if one's efforts are feeble.

Here is the fourth point. Joyful effort as well is something that depends upon
the mind, something that depends on your constant practice of it to bring it to
its final conclusion. Consider the fact that a single small instance of clear and
focused concentration, in which with a joyful state of mind you are practicing
meditation upon something like the first concentration level, can as a result lead
you even so far as a birth in the place of the Pure One (Brahma), or the like.
Along these same lines, an instance of the mind, and the related actions of body and
speech, which are not related to a powerful state of mind are unable to lead to
a desired result, such as the development of the the state of mind of the first
concentration level, if one's efforts are feeble--meaning where one has little joy
in the task. Therefore it all depends on a powerful state of mind.

Suppose you attempt every kind of practice
Where you repeat, or do other asceticisms,
Over a long period of time.
If you allow your mind to be distracted

Here is the fifth point. The culmination of the perfection of meditation as well
is something that depends on the mind--a mind which is free of dullness and
agitation, and which is lucid; a mind which is under the constant influence of
thoughts of sadness over this life. Suppose now that you attempt every kind of
practice where you repeat a great number of secret mantras, or asceticisms, such
as fasting or the like, over a long period of time. If you allow your mind to be
distracted to other objects as you do these practices, then you will be unable to
understand the true nature of things.
As the Buddha himself has stated in scripture, "Oh monks! The practices of
asceticism or of recitation, or any of the like, are fruitless when the mind is
distracted to the objects of desire." What Lord Buddha is saying is that
practices done this way are meaningless, in the sense that they can never lead
to the desired result.

Here is the sixth point. Wisdom is also something that depends upon the
mind. Suppose any particular person fails to understand this secret of the mind,
ultimate reality, because they are no proper vessel for being taught the highest
import of all, the principal instruction of this teaching. It may be the case that
they hope to reach matchless bliss, and to smash all the sufferings of the cycle of
life. They will nonetheless be left without reaching the goal they wish for; they
will be left wandering here and there, wherever, just as they always have been.
Therefore the perfection of wisdom depends on the mind.

Course X: Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life, Part I
Reading Nine: Awareness
The following reading is taken from the Entry Point for Children of the Victorious
Buddhas (rGyal-sras 'jug-ngogs), a commentary by Gyaltsab Je Darma Rinchen
(1364-1432) on the book called Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life (Byang-chub-
sems-dpa'i spyod-pa la 'jug-pa) by Master Shantideva (c. 700 AD).

,GSUM PA LA GNYIS, DRAN PA SKYE TSUL DANG , DE LAS SHES BZHIN SKYE TSUL LO,
The third section covers how to develop awareness through recollection. There
are two steps to this explanation: how to develop recollection, and then how
awareness is developed from this.

,DES NA SANGS RGYAS RJES DRAN PA'ANG ,
,DE LA YANG DANG YANG DU 'BYUNG ,
Because of this, recalling to mind
The Buddhas will also come
To him or her again and again.

Here is the first. If any particular person performs the contemplation described
above then, because of this, recalling to mind the high qualities of the Buddhas,
along with those of the Dharma and the Sangha, will also come to him or her
again and again. They will thus be able to develop with ease the practice of
recalling the Three Jewels.

,GANG TSE DRAN PA YID SGO NAS,
,BSRUNG BA'I DON DU GNAS GYUR PA,
,DE TSE SHES BZHIN 'ONG 'GYUR ZHING ,
,SONG BA DAG KYANG 'ONG BAR 'GYUR,
Suppose a person reaches a point
Where they're able to keep their recollection
Very solid; where they are able
To use their mind to protect.
At this point it will lead to awareness,
And even should these two
Disappear, they nonetheless return.

,GNYIS PA NI, DRAN PA DE LAS GANG GI TSE DRAN PA YID KYI SGO NAS NYON MONGS BSRUNG BA'I DON DU GNAS PAR GYUR PA DE'I TSE BYA BA DANG BYA BA MA YIN PA'I GNAS SKABS LA RTOG CING JI LTA BA BZHIN DU SHES PA'I SHES BZHIN YOD PAR 'GYUR ZHING , LAN CIG NYAMS NAS SONG BA DAG KYANG PHYIR 'ONG BAR 'GYUR BAS BSGRUB PA NYAMS LEN LA MKHAS MI MKHAS NI, DRAN PA DANG SHES BZHIN GYI SKYED TSUL LA RAG LAS PAS DES DE LA MKHAS PAR BYA'O,
Here is the second point. Suppose a person reaches a point where he or she is able
to keep their recollection very solid--is able to use their mind to protect themselves
against mental afflictions. At this point then the recollection will lead this person
to gain a kind of awareness, where they are able to watch themselves and grasp
properly the distinction between occasions when their actions are proper, and
when they are improper. It is also the case that, even should these two attitudes
slip and disappear at some point, they nonetheless return. Therefore the question
of whether one becomes a master of Buddhist practice or not hinges upon how
well one can maintain their recollection and awareness; and thus one should
seek to become a master of these two attitudes.

Here next is the third point from before, which covers how one should train
oneself in the act of using recollection and awareness to guard one's mind. We
proceed in three separate sections: how to train oneself in the ethics of
restraint, in the ethics of collecting goodness, and in the ethics of working for
the benefit of all living beings.
The first section has two parts of its own, which are striving for purity in the
actions of all three doors of expression, and protecting oneself from slipping.
The first of these three has three divisions: how to watch one's physical and
verbal behavior; how to watch one's mind; and then an explanation of
situations which are allowed, and those which are not. Watching one's
physical and verbal behavior will be presented in terms of examining one's
motivation prior to any physical action; advice concerning how to look around,
and other subjects; applying this advice to other activities; and then finally
watching how one is staying.

Here is the first. Whenever one is about to go somewhere, or do anything of
the kind, one should at the particular moment--that is, before anything
else--examine one's motivation: one should decide, "This state of mind has
something wrong with it," or "This state of mind has nothing wrong with it." If
at this point you find that your motivation does have something wrong with it,
then you should apply the appropriate antidote, which is to freeze exactly as you
are, like a bump on a log, and refuse to be moved by something which is not
good.

The advice relating to how one should look around comes in four separate
steps: a general presentation on how you should undertake the activity of
using your eyes to look around; instructions on what to do if you become
tired; what to do if someone approaches you; and what to do when you have
finished refreshing yourself.

,DON MED G-YENG BAR LTA BA NI,

Here is the first. I should never, at any time, look around from side to side
meaninglessly, with my mind distracted. This is because of the fact that, should
I do so, my mind will get worse. Rather I should be sure to fix my mind on a
virtuous object: whenever I look around, I should always keep my eyes lowered,
looking ahead no farther than the length of a plowshare, [which is explained
in scripture as one armspan].

Here is the second point. If the time should come to invigorate myself--that
is, if I find that I have become tired looking this way--then to refresh myself I
should for the time being raise my eyes, and look around.

Here is the third point. When I have started to look around this way, it may
happen that someone comes into my line of vision, and approaches me. At this
point I should look at them and give them a smile, and say, "It is good to see you."
Moreover, as I move down the road it may be necessary to check whether or
not there are any dangers or the like on the way, and in such a case I should
look around me on all sides, again and again.

Here is the fourth point. When I have finished refreshing myself and it is time to
go on, then I should turn around and look at the things behind me. I should check
in front of me and in back of me--to see if there is anything there like a cliff--and
then either go, or come, as may be fitting.

Next is the third section from above, on applying this advice to other activities.
I should act the same way in every circumstance in which I am about to engage in
any physical or verbal action. That is, I should act only after determining whether
there is any meaning, any benefit, to myself and others.

Here is the fourth part, about how to stay in different states. Whenever I am
engaged in anything at all, I should consider myself, prepare myself, and say,
"This is how my body is engaged right now." And then I should look at myself and
say, "Now I am going to undertake some activity for a particular length of time;
just how will my body be engaged, in what kind of activity?" After this, go and
try your best to undertake some activity which is free of any kind of wrong.

Next comes the second point, on how to watch one's mind. Here again there
are two divisions: tying the mind to some virtuous object, and checking
whether or not you are keeping your mind one-pointedly fixed upon a virtue
or not.
Here is the first. My mind is an elephant that has yet to be trained, and is still
wild. I must tie it properly to a strong stake; that is, to the spiritual object where
I have promised to keep the focus of my mind, one-pointedly. I must try now
with my every effort to watch that it stays this way, without ever getting loose.

Here is the second division. Now no matter what I will make efforts to achieve
a kind of single-pointed concentration which is focussed on a virtuous object, and
which is never distracted elsewhere. I will see that my concentration never slips
away, for even a single second, to any other object. And I will examine my
thoughts constantly in a certain way, which is by saying to myself, "What is my
mind engaged in right now; is it something which is proper, or something which
is improper?"

Next is the third point, an explanation of situations which are allowed, and
those which are not. Suppose there is a situation where there is some danger
that threatens my life, or I am engaged in some celebration such as an offering
to the Jewels, or else I have to do anything related to something which is of even
greater benefit to living beings, or anything of the like. And suppose that
during one of these occasions I find myself unable to maintain very fine scrutiny
of the actions of my body and my mind.
In such a case we are allowed to continue as we may find most convenient. The
Sutra Requested by Unending Understanding states, "At any specific moment, when
you are performing the act of giving in this way, then you should withdraw
somewhat from the practice of the ethical way of life, and leave it for the
moment." This quotation is saying that, if you are unable at the same moment
to maintain both of these two practices, then assuming it is the time for
giving--that is, assuming you are concentrating primarily on learning the
practice of giving at this point--then you should leave off the practice of an
ethical way of life, as far as those fine points which you are unable to maintain
at the moment. The point of this verse is that we must become masters in
understanding the proper order of the path, and then complete each step of the
path in its proper order.

With any action first consider,
And then undertake it,
Without thinking of any other.
If you focus your mind on this,
Then for the time being undertake
To practice it alone.
If you keep this way then everything
Will come out perfectly;
Otherwise you will fail in both.
If you follow this too then
The secondary afflictions of failing
In watchfulness will never grow.

One may raise the following objection: "The practice of an ethical way of life
is superior to the practice of giving; how is it then that we are supposed to
leave off the former practice for the latter?" With any series of actions that you
must practice in a definite order, you must be careful to consider carefully

which should come first. Then you should undertake this first action and not
think of some other one.
If you are starting with the practice of giving, if you are focussing your mind on
this, then you should for the time being undertake to practice it only. If you train
yourself this way where there is a path that must be followed in a certain fixed
order, then everything will come out perfectly; whereas if you do otherwise, and
reverse the order somehow, you will fail in bringing both the earlier and the
later steps to their proper conclusion.
There are secondary types of mental affliction which are a kind of failure to
understand the stages of the path, a failure of watchfulness, and if you follow this
understanding of the stages then they will never grow strong within you. As
such you must become a master in understanding the proper order of the
stages of the path.

Here is the second major section, on how to prevent oneself from slipping.
This section itself has two parts: preventing yourself from slipping in the rules
for the body, and preventing yourself from slipping in the rules for the mind.
The first of these has three divisions, which are keeping yourself from falling
under the control of distraction; giving up activities which are meaningless;
and checking your motivation whenever you engage in any action.

Here is the first. I should keep myself from engaging in all sorts of useless
conversation such as talk about the leaders of countries, and criminals or the
like; I should as well avoid all those many kinds of interesting spectacles such as
performances of music or dance. Even if there is some pressing need to engage
in these things, or if I do so out of consideration for others' wishes, I should still
abandon any desire at all for these things.

Here is the second division. Even though one may not be a fully ordained
monk, one should still recall the rules established by Those Who Have Gone to Bliss,
and out of terror for the problems that would come to oneself desist immediately
from any activity such as digging the earth, cutting living plants, or drawing in the

The third division has three parts of its own: the teaching, its explanation, and
a summary. Whenever I feel a wish to move my body, or any wish at all to express
myself in speech, I will first check my own mind. I will not allow myself to fall
under the power of anything wrong, and I resolve firmly to act in accord with
what is right: with what I know should be done, and should not be done.

The explanation comes in five sections: what to do when you feel as though
you want to have a mental affliction; what to do when agitation or similar
thoughts come; what to do when you feel desire for material gain or fame, or
anything of the like; what to do when you should be thinking of the benefit of
others; and what to do when you feel as though you want to have a feeling
like anger, depression, or such.

Here is the second section. Suppose I begin to feel agitation, where my mind
floats from one object to another, or else an urge to humilate someone, by
laughing at them derisively. Or say that I start to feel pride, where I am puffed
up by thinking of my own qualities, or else conceit, which comes from thinking
of my own youthful vitality or the like. Suppose as well that it occurs to me that
I should expose another person's faults publicly, or that I should pull the wool over
another's eyes; that is, deceive another person by some devious action motivated
by my own lack of contentment, my desire for some kind of profit for myself.

Here is the third section. Suppose as well that I feel a desire for gain--in the form
of money for teaching or the like; or else honor, such as when others prepare a
seat upon which I shall teach; or reputation. Or perhaps I may begin to hope
for a great circle of servants, or else desire the service of others, who come to honor
me by massaging my body. On these occasions too I should stay still as a bump

endure another's anger, or some suffering, or anything of the like. Or suppose
I fall under the power of laziness, meaning a lack of joy for performing virtuous
deeds, and so develop a fear for accomplishing good deeds or such.
Just so I might want to act in some insistent, uncontrolled way, lacking any self-
restraint at all, or else feel the urge to engage in some irrelevant chatter. Or else
I may get the thought to feel some bias for my own kind, my own relatives or the
like. At such times too I should stop myself, and stay as still as a bump on a log,
and maintain the antidotes for all these actions.

way check myself for thoughts which are filled with mental afflictions, or else for
those thoughts where I want to make some kind of meaningless efforts. Whenever they
do come, I should act like some great and powerful warrior: I should use the
proper antidote attitudes, and keep my mind firm and steady, preventing it from
engaging in any negative action.

Course X: Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life, Part I
Reading Ten: The Perfections of Giving and Ethical Living
The following reading is taken from the Entry Point for Children of the Victorious
Buddhas (rGyal-sras 'jug-ngogs), a commentary by Gyaltsab Je Darma Rinchen
(1364-1432) on the book called Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life (Byang-chub-
sems-dpa'i spyod-pa la 'jug-pa) by Master Shantideva (c. 700 AD).

Here is the third part, [which is advice that you should involve yourself only
with virtuous activities]. This part has three sections of its own: advice to
perform the act of giving towards exceptional objects; advice to perform
virtuous activities on one's own accord; and advice to develop the perfection
of giving ever higher, and to act after once one has examined the purpose of
acting.

The power of the virtue
Is so much more powerful
If done all the time,

Motivated by strong enthusiasm,
Only by the antidote, or performed
Towards objects of high spiritual qualities,
Those who've been of great benefit,
Or those who are suffering.

Here is the first. Since the power of the virtue is so much more powerful, I should
exert myself in the following kinds of virtuous activity:
* Giving which is done "all the time," meaning on a regular basis;
* That which is motivated by strong enthusiasm--performed with fierce
good feelings;
* That which is motivated only by attitudes such as a lack of
attachment--by thoughts which provide the antidote for
negativities;
* That which is performed towards the highest objects: objects of high
spiritual qualities such as the Three Jewels or the like, and objects
who have been of great benefit, such as your parents;
* That which is performed towards objects which are suffering--the poor
and the like.

Here is the second. I should become a master of engaging in those actions which
are to be taken up, and of avoiding those actions which are to be abandoned.
And I should learn to have great faith and enthusiasm for virtuous deeds. These
then will lead me to perform virtuous deeds at all times. And I will not perform
these good deeds only because others have induced me to do so; I will learn to
accomplish all kinds of virtue even if there is no one else at all on whom I can depend
to help me.

Concentrate on others' aims.

Here is the third. I will perform the perfections of giving and "the rest," meaning
all of those up to wisdom, in such a way that they are heightened ever further;
that is, so they increase in strength. Whenever I engage in the perfections of
giving, an ethical way of life, or any of the others, I should never give up
activities which are of greater virtuous power for those which are of less--I
should rather concentrate my efforts on the greater.
These lines are indicating, by implication, the following: where one is unable
to perform both the action of lesser power and the one of greater
power--where a time has come where one must choose between the two--then
we should give up the deed of lesser virtue to prevent the greater one from
being lost. How do we establish which deeds are greater, and which are
lesser? If for example there is a choice between accomplishing one's own aims
or someone else's aims in this present life--if by bringing about one you would
lose the other--then you should concentrate on others' aims.

The third general section concerns training oneself in the ethical way of life in
which one acts for the benefit of others. Here there are three parts: throwing
oneself into the service of others; acting in ways which attract others to the
teaching, while still striving to avoid being sullied by any bad deeds oneself;
and training oneself in ways to preserve the opinions of others, and acting so
that one is left unsullied by bad deeds.

Here is the first. One may ask the following question: "Bodhisattvas should, in
this way mentioned above, learn the art of which actions to take up, and which
to give up. And then they should always make efforts to fill the needs of others.
Isn't it true though that, because filling the needs of others may require us to
undertake a wide variety of different actions, we might ourselves become
sullied by some bad deeds?"
Those who possess compassion, the Buddhas, see directly even those objects which
are "distant," in the sense of being abstruse. There are certain actions, like the
seven bad deeds of body and speech, which they have prohibited for
listeners--for those who are working primarily for their own aims. On certain
extraordinary occasions though, they have allowed even these same actions to
bodhisattvas; when such persons perform these acts they are not only not a
bad deed, but rather become the accumulation of great goodness.

The Sutra on Skilful Means, the Great Secret, for example mentions the ship
captain named Great Compassion, who killed evil persons and thereby erased
many eons of his future suffering in the cycle of life. There is also the incident
that is stated to have occurred with the Brahmin youth named Karma.
The phrase "those who possess compassion, who see to a distance" can also be
explained as referring to these bodhisattvas--the ones for whom the seven
deeds of body and speech are allowed--themselves. [It should be noted at this
point that the practice of performing one of the seven bad deeds for great
goodness is severely restricted, to those who have been practicing the

The second part has two of its own: attracting others to the teaching through
the use of material things, and attracting them through the Dharma. The first
of these has three further sections: an explanation of the distinction between
when to give food and clothing, and when not to give them; advice not to
harm the body in order to accomplish some minor deed; and a description of
the time and purpose when it would be appropriate to give up even one's own
body.

Whenever I partake of food, I should also offer an equal share to each of the
following, should they be present: to "those who have fallen wrong," meaning
animals and tormented spirits; to the sick and others who have no one to protect
them; and to those "who are engaged in asceticism"--referring to celibate,
ordained persons.
I myself should follow the advice expressed in the phrase, "In all things judge
the proper amount," and eat only the proper amount of food, without committing
any of the inappropriate deeds which relate to partaking of food. The
motivation and such for eating should be the same as that described in the
Letter to a Friend.

A bodhisattva who is a fully ordained monk should be ready to give away any
possession he has, with the exception of his three dharma robes: his outer robe, his
inner robe, and his lower robe. Even with these three robes, the bodhisattva
may give away any extra ones that he may have, but may not give away those
where he has no more than one, since this would be an obstacle to his practice
of celibacy.

Here is the second section. My body is a base from which I carry out the holy
Dharma; it is something with which, if I care for it properly, I can accomplish
vast purposes for myself and others. I should never do any kind of harm to it
merely for some minor benefit that it might do for someone else--I should shield
it in the same way I would an open wound. Why is this so? Because if I am
able to act this way, then I can--by using the spiritual leisure and fortune which
I've found--reach the culmination of the practice of the three trainings, and in
this way quickly fulfill the hopes of every living being. As the Four Hundred Verses
says,
We should admittedly view this body
as though it were the enemy;
But all the same it is a thing
we must protect as well.
It is an action which creates
tremendous stores of merit
To live a life of many years
maintaining one's morality.

In both this and the future.

Here is the third part. It is admittedly true that bodhisattvas do, from the very
beginning, offer their own bodies and the like to living beings from the very
bottom of their hearts. I should never though perform the asceticism of giving
away the flesh of my body or something of the like to someone who requests it
in a way which involves an impure version of the thoughts of compassion where
I am supposed to cherish others more than myself; that is, in such a way that
I would feel distaste, or regret my offering later, or anything of the like. This
point is expanded upon in the Compendium of Training, where a sutra is quoted
which states that giving away things at the wrong time is the work of demons.

When there comes a time however when I have, on my side, freed myself from
stinginess and other obstacles to the perfection of giving, and when I could
without any problems thereby accumulate a great deal of virtuous energy, then
I should no matter what give away my body, for this would act as a cause for me
to achieve great goals in both this and all my future lives.

Here is the second part from above, about attracting others to the teachings
through the Dharma. Here there are three points: notes on the proper behavior
of a person who is listening to the Dharma--that is, a description of persons
to whom it would be improper to teach the Dharma; learning to judge details
of the state of mind of the person who is to receive the teachings; and
instruction not to take a person who has an aptitude for the wide-reaching
path and introduce them to one which is lesser.

Or who cover their heads with cloth.

Here is the first. I should not teach the Dharma to those who have no respect for the
Dharma, or no respect for the one teaching the Dharma. Nor should I teach
the Dharma to those who exhibit certain kinds of behavior, such as wearing veils
or the like (assuming they are not doing so because they are ill); holding an
umbrella, a staff, or some weapon; or covering the tops of their heads with cloth or
such.

And far-reaching aspects to the lesser,
Nor a woman without a male.

Of respecting all Dharma equally,
No superior or inferior kinds.

Here is the second. I should not teach the profound and far-reaching aspects of the
Dharma to those of lesser minds, to those who are not fit to receive these
teachings. Nor should I teach the Dharma to a woman alone, without another
male present.
It is further stated that one has committed the bad deed of rejecting the
Dharma if one discriminates between different parts of the teaching, by saying
for example that the teachings of the greater and lesser ways are, respectively,
superior and inferior kinds of Dharma--one better than the other; one more proper
than the other; one a way to enlightenment, and the other not; or anything of
the like. I should therefore follow a code of behavior where I respect all of them
equally, and put each of them into practice.

I should never take one who is fit
To receive the teachings of the far-reaching
And introduce them to a teaching which is lesser.
Neither should I ever abandon the code
Of behavior, nor abuse the open and secret
Teachings through deceiving someone.

Here is the third. I should never take a person who is the type who can follow
the greater way, one who is fit to receive the teachings of the far-reaching way, and
introduce them to a teaching which is lesser--that is, I should never lead them
along the path of the listeners. This is because it is stated that, should I do so,
I will have committed a transgression of my vows.
Neither should I ever abandon the code of behavior contained in the morality of
restraint: I should never abuse the open and secret teachings through deceiving
someone who is fit to receive their actual content by telling them that, to make
themselves pure, all they need to do is to recite the open and secret teachings
out loud.

Here is the third overall section from above, which concerns training oneself
in ways to preserve the opinions of others, and acting so that one is left
unsullied by bad deeds. Here there will be an expanded explanation followed
by a summary. The former of these two has three parts of its own: giving up
physical actions which are wrong, and anything which would cause others to
lose their faith; how to act when pointing out a road, or something of the like;
and how to undertake the act of sleeping.

,SO SHING DANG NI MCHIL MA 
DAG,DOR BA NA NI DGAB PAR BYA,
,GCI LA SOGS PA'ANG LONGS SPYOD PA'I,
,CHU DANG THANG LA DOR BA SMAD,
I should, whenever I throw out
The cleaning stick, or spit,
Cover them up.
Disposing of urine or anything similar
In water or on a piece of ground
Which others use is rebuked.

Here is the first. Bodhisattvas who have also left the home life must, except
in those cases which are specifically allowed, strictly maintain each detail of the
code of behavior spoken in the collection of scripture devoted to discipline,
which is something shared by both the greater and lesser ways. And even
those bodhisattvas who are still leading the home life must as well maintain
these points, in order to preserve the faith of others.

Therefore I should--whenever I throw out the so-shing stick which I use to clean
my mouth, or whenever I spit--cover them up with dirt or the like. And since
I would be rebuked by the powerful pleasure creatures and other such beings
if I did so, I should avoid ever disposing of excrement or urine, or else mucus
from my nose, or anything similar in water or on a piece of ground which others use
along with me.

I should never eat in such a way that my mouth is totally stuffed with the food,
or so that I make a loud smacking noise or anything of the like, or else with my
mouth wide open. When I sit on a Dharma throne or similar seat, I should never
stick my legs out touching the ground, or such. Neither should I rub myself on
my shoulders together, meaning at the same time. It is however no fault if you
rub yourself on your shoulders one at a time.

,BZHON PA MAL STAN GNAS DAG TU,

I should never stay in or on
A single conveyance, a single bed,
Or in the same place with another
Who is a woman. I should avoid
Any kind of behavior which might cause
People of the world to lose their faith,
Whether the obvious or the acquainted.

[As a monk,] I should never stay in or on a single conveyance, something like a
horse or the like, or on a single bed, or in the same place with another person who
is a woman. Even those bodhisattvas who are laypeople should avoid staying
together with women who are not their own relatives.
In brief, I should avoid any kind of behavior which might cause people of the world
to lose their faith, whether it is behavior that is obviously a problem to everyone
everywhere, or whether it is something peculiar to that particular place or time,
and therefore something that I might not already be aware of, but would have
to acquaint myself with.

,SOR MOS BRDA NI MI BYA STE,

But rather use all my right hand,
Right and with respect.

Here is the second. When I am pointing out something to someone, I should
never do so with individual fingers of my left hand, since this would be
something insulting them. Rather I should point with an attitude of respect,
using all the fingers of my right hand, and turning it palm up, right. This too is
the manner in which I should guide any person along a way.

In a very animated way, but rather
Move them only a slight bit
And make some type of noise
Or snapping with them.
Were I to act differently though
It would show a lack of control.

Unless there is some specific purpose to be served by doing so, I should never
gesture with my hands in a very animated way, since this might lead me to
become careless. Rather I could move my hands only a slight bit, and make some
type of a noise or snapping with them. It would though show a lack of controlled
behavior if I were to act differently, and make this noise too loudly.

Here is the third. Whenever I go to sleep, I should emulate the way that the
Savior acted when he laid down and pretended to pass into "nirvana." That is,
I should first lie with my head in the desired direction. Then I should lay with
my right side down, and place my left leg atop my right. I should put my
head down on my right hand, and wrap myself nicely in my dharma robes,
and sleep.
As I go off to sleep I should place my mind on a virtuous object, and utilize
the attitudes of recollection and awareness. From the very beginning, as sleep
comes, I should be sure to keep a very luminous state of mind, where light fills
my mind, and I should reflect upon how I will rise up from my sleep quickly.
As I drift off I should think of how I am about to sustain my body with the
sleep, and then afterwards make great efforts in performing virtuous deeds.

The different types of activities
Described as something that bodhisattvas
Should undertake are limitless.

And practice til the time arrives,
As it surely will, when I can

Here is the second point from above. The various scriptures, and the
commentaries which explain their true intent, describe different types of activities
to be undertaken by bodhisattvas, activities which are unlimited. I would never be
able to accomplish each and every one of these at present. Therefore from the
very beginning I must, as mentioned above, acquaint my own mind with these
activities, and practice until the time arrives, as it must, when I can put in my own
life each and every one of these ways of living.
