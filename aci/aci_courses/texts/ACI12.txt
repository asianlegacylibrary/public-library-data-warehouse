************
Contemplation One
We need to see emptiness

,, BZHI PA LHAG MTHONG GI NGO BO SHES RAB LA BSLAB TSUL LA GNYIS, LE'U'I GZHUNG BSHAD PA DANG , LE'U'I MTSAN NO,
The fourth principal section, how to train oneself in wisdom, the essence of
special insight, has two parts of its own: an explanation of the body of the
[ninth] chapter, and an explanation of the chapter's name.

,DANG PO LA GSUM, THAR PA THOB PAR 'DOD PAS DE KHO NA NYID RTOGS PA'I SHES RAB BSKYED 
DGOS PAR BSTAN PA DANG , DE KHO NA NYID RTOGS PA'I SHES RAB JI LTAR BSKYED PA'I THABS DANG , DES NA DE BSKYED PA LA 'BAD PAR GDAMS PA'O,
The first part has three sections of its own: a demonstration that those who
wish to reach freedom must develop the wisdom which realizes thusness; the
way to develop wisdom which realizes thusness; and advice that one should,
therefore, make great efforts to develop this wisdom.

,DANG PO LA GNYIS, SPYI'I DON DANG , YAN LAG GI DON TO,
The first of these sections comes in two steps: the general point, and secondary
points.

,DANG PO NI, GZHAN RGYUD KYI SDUG BSNGAL MTHA' DAG ZHI BAR BYED LA BLA NA MED PA'I BYANG CHUB THOB DGOS PAS, DE KHO NA NYID RTOGS DGOS KYANG RANG RGYUD KYI SDUG BSNGAL ZHI BA LA DE KHO NA NYID RTOGS CI DGOS SNYAM NA, MGON PO KLU SGRUB KYIS JI SRID PHUNG POR 'DZIN YOD PA, DE SRID DE LA NGAR 'DZIN YOD, , CES PHUNG PO BDEN 'DZIN YOD PA DE SRID DU NGA DANG NGA YI BAR RANG GI MTSAN NYID KYIS GRUB PAR 'DZIN PA'I 'JIG LTA MI LDOG PAR GSUNGS LA, NYAN RANG DGRA BCOM PAS 'JIG LTA ZAD PAR MA SPANGS PA SU YANG MI 'DOD CING , DE LA PHUNG PO BDEN 'DZIN ZAD DGOS PAS NYAN RANG 'PHAGS PAS KYANG PHUNG PO BDEN MED DU RTOGS PAR BZHED PA LTAR, SLOB DPON 'DIS KYANG 'KHOR BA'I SDUG BSNGAL ZHI BA LA YANG DE KHO NA NYID RTOGS DGOS PAR BZHED DO, 'OG TU YANG 'CHAD PAR 'GYUR RO,
Here is the first section. One might have the following thought:
It's true that, in order to help put an end to the entire amount of
suffering that exists in other people, we must achieve matchless
enlightenment. And for this reason we must realize thusness.
How could it be though that, in order to put an end only to that
suffering which exists in ourselves, we would also have to realize
thusness?

Remember though that our Protector, Nagarjuna, has said the following:
As long as a person possesses the habit
Of grasping to the heaps as true,
For just this long will they also grasp
To the thought that these are "me."
He is saying here that, as long as we still possess the habit of grasping to our
heaps as true, then for just this long will we find ourselves unable to reverse
our "view of destruction": our tendency to view these heaps as being "me" or
"mine," in a way where they exist through some nature of their own. To do
this though, one must finish off one's tendency to grasp to the heaps as
existing in truth.
Now there is no one at all who would claim that enemy destroyers of the
Listener or Self-Made Buddha types have not yet eliminated their "view of
destruction" in its entirety. As such, the Protector is here stating the position
that realized beings of these two types as well have realized that the heaps
have no true existence. And in keeping with this position, the present master
[Shantideva] also holds the position that--even just to put an end to the
sufferings of the cycle of life--one must still realize thusness. This point will
also be discussed further on.

Contemplation Two
What goes first for wisdom

,YAN LAG 'DI DAG THAMS CAD NI,
,THUB PAS SHES RAB DON DU GSUNGS,
All of these branches then were stated
By the Able Ones to be
Something for the purpose of wisdom.

,YAN LAG 'DI DAG CES PA LE'U BRGYAD PA NAS BSHAD PA'I ZHI GNAS TZAM LA 'CHAD PA DANG , SBYIN SOGS PHAR PHYIN LHAG MA THAMS CAD LA 'CHAD PA'I LUGS GNYIS LAS, LE'U SNGA PHYI GNYIS TZAM GYI 'BREL BA LA SBYAR NA SNGA MA YANG RUNG MOD KYANG 'DIR PHYI MA LTAR BSHAD NA LEGS SO,
There are two different ways of explaining the phrase "these branches" in the
root text at this point. Sometimes it is explained as referring only to the
practice of quietude which was covered in the eighth chapter. But it is also
explained as referring to all of the remaining perfections, of giving and the rest.
If we restrict ourselves only to the relation between the present and the
preceding chapters, then the former method of explaining the phrase is also
admittedly appropriate. Here though it would be better if we commented
upon the phrase in its latter sense.

,SBYIN PA LA SOGS PA'I YAN LAG SHES RAB KYI DON DU GSUNGS, , ZHES PA LA DOGS PA 'DI LTAR BCAD DE, DE KHO NA NYID THOS BSAM GYIS RTOGS PA LA SBYIN SOGS SNGON DU 'GRO DGOS PA MA YIN TE, SPYIR STONG NYID RTOGS PA LA TSOGS BSAG DGOS KYANG 'DIR BSHAD PA 'DRA BA'I BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA'I SPYOD PA SNGON DU 'GRO MI DGOS TE SLOB DPON ZHI 'TSOS STONG NYID THOS BSAM GYIS GTAN LA 'BEBS TSUL GNYIS BSHAD PA BZHIN NO,
The full phrase here in the root text says that the branches of giving and the
rest were stated to be for the purpose of wisdom. There are a number of
questions raised by this statement which bear examination.

It is not the case that, to realize thusness through the processes of learning and
contemplation, giving and the rest must come before. Although it is true that
one must accumulate great merit in order to realize emptiness, it is not
necessary that the kinds of bodhisattva activities described here come first. We
could for example mention the two methods of coming to an understanding
of emptiness, through learning and contemplation, as described by Master
Shantarakshita.

,STONG NYID LA YID 'GYUR BA'I MYONG BA SKYE BA LA YANG DE DAG SNGON DU 'GRO DGOS PA'ANG MIN TE, DE LTA NA MI RTAG PA RTOGS PA LTA BU'I NYAMS MYONG LA'ANG DE DAG SNGON DU 'GRO DGOS PA MTSUNGS SO,
Neither is it the case that, in order to have an experience of emptiness that
would lead to a deep conviction in it, these other perfections would have to
come first. If this were so, then they would also have to come first in order for
a person to have a deep experience of something like the realization of
impermanence--the two causes would be just the same.

,STONG NYID RTOGS PA'I SGOM BYUNG GI LHAG MTHONG SKYE BA LA DE DAG SNGON DU 'GRO DGOS PA'ANG MIN TE, BYANG CHUB SEMS DPA'I SPYOD PA DE DAG SNGON DU MA SONG YANG NYAN RANG GIS DE KHO NA NYID RTOGS PA'I TSUL SNGAR BSHAD PA BZHIN NO,
It is not even the case that these have to come before one is able to develop the
kind of special insight which realizes emptiness and which comes through the
process of meditation. This is true because, as we have just mentioned,
persons of the Listener and Self-Made Buddha types are able to realize
thusness without the activities of a bodhisattva having come before.

,STONG NYID RTOGS PA'I SHES RAB KYIS CHOS SKU'I NYER LEN BYED CING SBYIN SOGS THABS RNAMS KYIS DE'I LHAN CIG BYED RKYEN BYED PAS SHES RAB KYIS 'BRAS BU DE THOB PA LA SBYIN SOGS RNAMS KYIS PHAN DGOS PAS DE DAG SHES RAB KYI DON DU GSUNGS SO ZHE NA, DE LTA NA SHES RAB DE DAG GI DON DU GSUNGS ZHES GO LDOG NA YANG MTSUNGS SO,
One may assert the following:

The wisdom wherein one realizes emptiness provides the
material cause for the dharma body, and the perfections which
relate to "method"--that is, giving and the like--provide the
contributing factors for this body. Therefore giving and the
others must make their contribution in order for wisdom to help
us to attain this goal. And this is why the text says that "they
were stated to be for the purpose of wisdom."
If this were true though, we could just as well reverse the statement, and say
that "wisdom was stated to be for the purpose of them."

,DES NA STONG NYID RTOGS PA'I SHES RAB MED NA SGRIB GNYIS GANG GI YANG SA BON ZAD PAR BYED MI NUS LA NYON SGRIB KYI SA BON ZAD PA TZAM LA TSOGS MTHA' YAS PAS BRGYAN PA MI DGOS KYANG , SHES SGRIB KYI SA BON ZAD PA LA DGOS SHING 'DIR YANG GTZO BO SHES SGRIB ZAD PA'I DON DU YIN PAS YAN LAG 'DI DAG SHES RAB DON DU GSUNGS PA YIN NO,
The real point then is as follows. Without the wisdom which realizes
emptiness, you could never finish off the seeds of any one of the two obstacles;
and it is not necessary that one be enriched with limitless masses of merit in
order to finish off just the seed of those obstacles which relate to the mental
afflictions. In order to finish off the seed of those obstacles which relate to
seeing all existing objects, however, it is necessary to be enriched in this way.
And since our work here is concerned primarily with finishing off the obstacles
to seeing all objects, then we can say that "these branches were stated to be
something for the purpose of wisdom."

Contemplation Three
The Two Realities

,KUN RDZOB DANG NI DON DAM STE,
,'DI NI BDEN PA GNYIS SU 'DOD,
We accept the truths as being two:
The one which is deceptive,
And the one which is the ultimate.

,GNYIS PA LA GSUM, BDEN GNYIS KYI RNAM GZHAG DANG , THAR PA TZAM THOB PAR 'DOD PAS KYANG STONG NYID RTOGS DGOS PAR BSGRUB PA DANG , STONG NYID SGRUB PA'I RIGS PA RGYAS PAR BSHAD PA'O,
The second part, [the way to develop wisdom which realizes thusness,] has
three sections of its own: a presentation of the two truths; a proof that, even
if all you hope to do is to reach freedom, you must still realize emptiness; and
a detailed explanation of the different types of reasoning used to prove
emptiness.

,DANG PO LA GNYIS, DNGOS DANG , STONG NYID LA DGOS NUS MED PA'I RTZOD PA SPANG BA'O,
The first of these three has two divisions of its own: the actual presentation,
and disproving the argument that emptiness is pointless and useless.

,DANG PO LA GSUM, BDEN GNYIS KYI DBYE BA DANG , MTSAN NYID DANG , DE GTAN LA 'BEBS PA'I GANG ZAG NGOS BZUNG BA'O,
The first of these two divisions covers three topics: a division of existence into
two truths; the definition of the two truths; and identifying the type of person
who can establish the nature of the two truths.

,DANG PO NI, BSLAB BTUS SU YAB SRAS 'JAL BA'I MDO DRANGS PA LAS, 'DI LTAR DE BZHIN GSHEGS PAS KUN RDZOB DANG DON DAM PA GNYIS THUGS SU CHUD DE SHES PAR BYA BA YANG KUN 
RDZOB DANG DON DAM PA'I BDEN PA 'DIR ZAD DO, , DE YANG BCOM LDAN 'DAS KYIS STONG PA NYID DU RAB TU GZIGS, RAB TU MKHYEN, LEGS PAR MNGON DU BYAS PAS DE'I PHYIR THAMS CAD MKHYEN PA ZHES BYA'O ZHES GSUNGS TE, SHES PAR BYA BA YANG ZHES PAS SHES BYA DBYE GZHI DANG , 'DIR ZAD DO ZHES PAS BDEN GNYIS SU GRANGS NGES PA DANG , BDEN PA GNYIS KA DE BZHIN GSHEGS PAS THUGS SU CHUD PA'I PHYIR THAMS CAD MKHYEN PAR BSTAN TO, , DES NA DON DAM PA'I BDEN PA SHES BYA MA YIN PA DANG BLO GANG GIS KYANG MA RTOGS PA SPYOD 'JUG GI DGONGS PAR 'CHAD PA NI LOG PAR 'CHAD PA'O,
Here is the first of the three. The following quotation from the Sutra on the
Meeting of the Father and the Son appears in the Compendium of the Trainings:
Thus do Those Who Have Gone That Way fathom the deceptive
and the ultimate: and so, knowable objects are either deceptive
truth or ultimate truth, and nothing else. So too do the
Conquerors see them perfectly as emptiness; know them so,
perfectly, and bring them to reality with excellence; and this is
why they we call them the All-Knowing.
The fact that all knowable objects are the thing which is divided into two
truths is conveyed by the words "...and so, knowable objects." The phrase "and
nothing else" expresses the fact that there are exactly two truths, no more and
no less. The point too is that, because Those Who Have Gone That Way
fathom both the truths completely, they are all-knowing. As such, the
explanation that it is the intent of the Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life to
say that ultimate truth is not a knowable object, or that it cannot be realized
by any state of mind at all, is an explanation which is completely wrong.

Contemplation Four
We can see ultimate reality

,DON DAM BLO YI SPYOD YUL MIN,
,BLO NI KUN RDZOB YIN PAR BRJOD,
The ultimate is not something which is
An object of the mind; the mind
Is something said to be deceptive.

GNYIS PA NI, GZHAN GYI LUGS DGAG PA DANG , RANG GI LUGS BZHAG PA GNYIS KYIS SHES PAR BYA BA'O,
For the second topic, [the definition of the two truths,] we will proceed in two
steps: refuting the opponent's position, and presenting our own position.

,DANG PO NI, SNGON GYI STOD LUNG RGYA DMAR LA SOGS PA KHA CIG DON DAM BLO YI SPYOD YUL MIN ZHES PA'I RKANG PA DANG PO DAM BCA' DANG PHYI MA RTAGS SU BYAS NAS DON DAM BDEN PA RTOG PA DANG RTOG MED KYI SHES PA GANG GI YANG YUL DU MI RUNG STE BLO DANG BLO'I YUL YIN NA KUN RDZOB BDEN PA YIN PAS KHYAB PA RKANG PA 'OG MAS BSTAN PAS GRUB BO ZHES 'DOD PA NI, RNAM PA THAMS CAD DU MI RIGS TE THEG CHEN 'PHAGS PA'I MNYAM GZHAG NA BLO MED PAR KHAS LEN NA RGYANG PHAN GYI GZHUNG BTZUGS PAR 'GYUR TE, DES 'CHI KHA TSUN CHAD DU RIG PA YOD LA DE NAS RGYUN CHAD PAR 'DOD CING , KHYED KYIS KYANG SBYOR LAM THA MA TSUN CHAD DU BLO YOD LA GNAS LUGS KYI DON LA MNYAM PAR BZHAG PA'I TSE MED PAR KHAS BLANGS PA'I PHYIR,
Here is the first of the two steps. Certain Tibetans of the past, such as Gyamar
of Tulung, have taken the following position:
The first line of this section, "The ultimate is not something which
is an object of the mind," is presenting an assertion by the author.
The second line is a reason to support his assertion. The point of
both is to say that ultimate reality could never be an object of any

state of mind, whether it be a conceptual state or a non-
conceptual state. This is proven by the fact that the latter line is
stating that anything which is either a state of mind or the object
of any state of mind must always be deceptive truth.
This position though is completely mistaken. If you accept the idea that during
the deep meditation of a realized being on the greater way there is no state of
mind at all, then you are introducing beliefs found in the texts of the Lokayata,
[a non-Buddhist sect in ancient India which said that there were no future
lives, and no such thing as karma and its consequences.] They believe that, up
to the point of death, the mind does exist; but that after this point it
discontinues. You too believe that, up to the very end of the path of
preparation, there is mind; but that while this person is engaged in deep
meditation upon the actual state of reality, there is no mind.

GZHAN YANG DON GANG ZHIG MNGON SUM DU RTOGS PAS DRI MA ZAD PAR BYED PA'I SHES BYA ZHIG KHAS MI LEN NA, DRI MA ZAD PA MI SRID PAS SANGS RGYAS DANG SEMS CAN GANG YANG BZHAG TU MED PA'I SKUR 'DEBS 'BA' ZHIG TU 'GYUR LA, KHAS LEN NA DON DAM BDEN PA YUL DANG DE RTOGS PA'I BLO MI 'DOD PA 'GAL KUN RDZOB YIN NA, DON DAM MI 'JAL BAS KHYAB PAR 'DOD NA, DON DAM BDEN PA RANG NYID KYIS RANG NYID 'JAL BA MI SRID PAS 'JAL BYED MED PA'I PHYIR GTAN MED DU 'GYUR LA, DE MED NA BDEN PA GNYIS KYI DBYE BA BYAS PA LA DGOS PA CI ZHIG YOD,
Beyond that, suppose we were to assert that there were no object at all which
was such that, if you realized it directly, this would function to allow you to
finish off every impurity. Since it would then be impossible to finish off one's
impurities, we could never say that some beings were enlightened and others
were not--and this would be a gross example of discounting something that
was actually true.
If on the other hand we asserted that such an object did exist, then it would be
a contradiction to refuse the existence of ultimate truth and the state of mind
which realizes it. If further we were to assert that, if something were the
deceptive type, it could never engage in the ultimate, then there would be no
state of mind which could ever engage in the ultimate, since it's a complete
impossibility for the ultimate to engage in itself. And in this case there would
be no ultimate truth at all; with it gone, what point would there ever be then
in making the division of objects into the two truths?

Moreover there is no contradiction raised at all when we assert that, if the
voidness of true existence is itself void of deceptive truth, then it must be
ultimate truth. And if this were not the case, then this voidness would have
to be deceptive reality. As Ending all Debate, [a text by the realized being
Nagarjuna,] states:
If we were to refuse the lack
Of any nature to things,
They would then be forced to have
A nature of their own.

Course XII: Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life, Part III
Reading Two: Contemplations of the Perfection of Wisdom,
Part II
The following contemplations are based on the Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way
of Life (Bodhisattvacharyavatara; Byang-chub-sems-dpa'i spyod-pa la 'jug-pa) of the
Buddhist master Shantideva (circa 700 AD), and the commentary upon it by
Gyaltsab Je Darma Rinchen (1364-1432) entitled Entry Point for Children of the
Victorious Buddhas (rGyal-sras 'jug-ngogs). The relevant sections are found at
folios 31A-31B and 117B-121B, respectively, in the ACIP electronic editions
TD3871 and S5436.
The content of the contemplations is translated directly from the root text and
commentary; the names of the contemplations are not a part of the original
text, but are based on the divisions of Gyaltsab Je's commentary and have been
supplied for reference. Each lesson is accompanied by the full detailed outline
for the section from Gyaltsab Je's commentary.

Only Two Kinds of People

,DE LA 'JIG RTEN RNAM GNYIS MTHONG ,
,RNAL 'BYOR PA DANG PHAL PA'O,
This one in the world we find of two types:
These are the high practitioners,
And common people as well.

,DE LA 'JIG RTEN PHAL PA NI,
,RNAL 'BYOR 'JIG RTEN GYIS GNOD CING ,
,RNAL 'BYOR PA YANG BLO KHYAD KYIS,
,GONG MA GONG MA RNAMS KYIS GNOD,
Now this common one in the world
Is disproved by the one we call
The "world practitioner."
Even high practitioners "disprove"
Each other by mental qualities
At relatively higher levels.

GSUM PA LA GNYIS, BDEN GNYIS GTAN LA 'BEBS 'DOD PA'I GANG ZAG GI DBANG DU BYAS PA'I DBYE BA DANG , BLO MTHO DMAN KYI KHYAD PAR BSHAD PA'O,
The third part, [identifying the type of person who can establish the nature of
the two truths,] includes two points: a division based on the type of person it
is who seeks to establish the nature of the two truths, and the distinction
between relative degrees of understanding.

,DANG PO NI, BDEN GNYIS GTAN LA 'BEBS 'DOD PA'I GANG ZAG NI DE LA 'JIG RTEN TE PHUNG PO LA BRTEN NAS BTAGS PA'I GANG ZAG YIN LA DE YANG RNAM PA GNYIS SU MTHONG STE, ZHI LHAG ZUNG 'BREL GYI TING NGE 'DZIN DANG LDAN PA'I RNAL 'BYOR PA CHOS THAMS CAD RANG BZHIN GYIS STONG PAR RTOGS PA DANG , PHAL PA DNGOS POR SMRA BA'O, , GTZO BO'I DBANG DU BYAS PA YIN GYI STONG NYID THOS BSAM GYIS RTOGS PA DANG GRUB MTHAS BLO MA BSGYUR BA'I GANG ZAG RNAMS KYANG DE DAG GI PHYOGS SU GTOGS PAR BYA'O,
Here is the first. This person who seeks to establish the nature of the two
truths is called "one in the world," in the sense that he is a person which is
projected based upon the heaps. And two types of these persons are found:
those who are high practitioners possessed of the single-pointed concentration
which combines quietude and special insight--that is, those who have realized
that every object which exists is empty of any nature of its own; and common
people as well--that is, those who profess that things which function exist truly.
This division by the way is only made with the primary type in mind; those
who have been able to realize emptiness, through the processes of learning and
contemplation, and those whose minds have not been affected by any
particular philosophical school are also included into the relevant group.

,GNYIS PA NI, DE LA 'JIG RTEN PHAL PA RDUL PHRAN CHA MED DANG SHES PA SKAD CIG CHA MED DANG DNGOS PO TZAM BDEN PAR 'DOD PA NI RNAL 'BYOR PA YANG YIN LA 'JIG RTEN PA YANG YIN PAS, RNAL 'BYOR 'JIG RTEN RANG BZHIN MED PAR RTOGS PA'I GANG ZAG DES DNGOS POR SMRA BA GRUB MTHA' 'OG MA RNAMS LA GNOD CING ZHI LHAG ZUNG 'BREL GYI RNAL 'BYOR PA YANG GONG MA GONG MA RNAMS KYIS 'OG MA RNAMS LA GNOD DE,
Here is the second. First consider those in the world who are common people:
those who believe that there are atoms which are partless, that the mind is
partless in the sense of existing in indivisible instants, and that functional
objects as such exist in truth. The "world practitioners"--so called because they
are both high practitioners and persons in the world--are people who have
realized that things have no nature of their own. These latter disprove the
system of the former, that lower system followed by those who assert that
functional things exist in truth. Even within high practitioners who are able
to combine quietude and special insight, those at each succeeding, higher level
disprove those at each preceding and lower level.

DBU MA PAS SEMS TZAM PA SHES PA BDEN PAR 'DOD PA RIGS PAS KHEGS LA, DES MDO SDE PA RDUL PHRAN CHA MED KHAS LEN PA RIGS PAS KHEGS PA'O, , STONG NYID RTOGS PA'I RNAL 'BYOR PA NANG PHAN TSUN GCIG GIS GCIG LA MI GNOD DAM SNYAM NA STONG NYID RTOGS PA'I RNAL 'BYOR PA YANG BLO'I KHYAD PAR GYIS SA GNYIS PA LA SOGS PA GONG MA GONG MA LA GNAS PA RNAMS KYIS SA DANG PO LA SOGS PAS 'OG MA LA GNAS PA RNAMS LA GNOD PA STE ZIL GYIS GNON PA YIN NO,
This is true because of the following. Those of the Middle-Way School utilize
reasoning to overthrow those of the Mind-Only School, who believe that the
mind exists in truth. Those of this latter school use reasoning to overthrow
those of the Sutrist School, who assert that there are atoms which are partless.
This fact may lead you to wonder whether those high practitioners who have
realized emptiness could somehow disprove each other. It is true that even
within those high practitioners who have realized emptiness, some are
distinguished from others by certain qualities of their state of mind. Those
staying at relatively higher levels, such as the second bodhisattva level, can be
said to "disprove" those of relatively lower levels, such as the first or whatever
it may be, in the sense that they outshine them.

You should further understand that the above fact implies others; even if we
restrict ourselves for example to one person's mind, certain seeds which are
eliminated through the path of habituation may not be stopped at some lower
level of realization--but the mind at a higher level may then be able to do so,
all due to a steadily increasing mental ability. What is the purpose for
including these particular lines? We begin with the step of ascertaining with
certainty the fact that there are only two states of mind: that in which we
realize deceptive truth, and that in which we realize ultimate truth. And since
it is the case that not even the valid perception in which we realize deceptive
truth can do anything to disprove the state of mind in which we realize
ultimate truth, then there is no need to mention that states such as the belief
in a partless atom could never do so either. We are meant by the lines to
understand that, not only is this true, but the state of mind in which we realize
ultimate truth itself disproves all other states of mind which hold to mistaken
extremes.

Contemplation Six
Things are Empty and Things Still Work

,GNYI GA YANG NI 'DOD PA'I DPES,

Through examples accepted
By no less than both; and because
For the goals they don't examine.

GNYIS PA LA GNYIS, DNGOS DANG , DE LA GNOD PA SPANG BA'O,
The second part, [disproving the argument that emptiness is pointless and
useless,] includes two points: the actual presentation, and disproving attempted
attacks upon our system.

,DANG PO NI, PHAL PA'I GRUB MTHA' LA CHOS THAM CAD RANG BZHIN MED PAR RTOGS PA'I RNAL 'BYOR PA'I RIGS PAS GNOD PA MI 'THAD DE RANG BZHIN MED PA'I SGRUB BYED MED PA'I PHYIR DANG , RANG BZHIN MED NA 'BRAS BU SANGS RGYAS KYI DON DU SBYIN SOGS LA SLOB PA DON MED PAR 'GYUR RO ZHE NA,
Here is the first. One might make the following claim:
It's incorrect to say that the logic used by high practitioners who have
realized that things have no nature of their own disproves the school of
those known as "common persons." This is because there exists no proof
that things have no such nature. And if nothing has any nature of its
own, then it's completely meaningless for a person to train themselves in
giving and the rest in order to reach the final goal of Buddhahood.

Isn't it though not true that there exists no proof that things have no nature of
their own? Because can't we prove that things have no nature by utilizing the
examples--that is, through the examples--of a dream, an illusion, or anything
of the like; which are accepted, agreed upon by convention, as being false, by
no less than both those of the Middle-Way School and those who assert that
things which function exist truly?

RANG BZHIN MED NA SBYIN SOGS LA SLOB PA DON MED DU 'GYUR BA MA YIN PAR THAL, SANGS RGYAS LA SOGS PA'I 'BRAS BU THOB PA'I DON DU SBYIN SOGS BDEN PAR MA GRUB KYANG MA BRTAGS MA DPYAD PA RDZUN PA SGYU MA LTA BUR RTOGS PA'I SHES RAB KYIS ZIN NAS 'JUG PA'I PHYIR, RANG BZHIN MED RTOGS KYI SHES RAB KYIS MA ZIN NA PHAR PHYIN LHAG MA RNAMS KYIS PHAR PHYIN GYI MING MI THOB CING DE'I DMIGS BU DANG BCAS PA RNAM MKHYEN GYI GRONG KHYER DU BGROD DGOS PA'I PHYIR RO,
And isn't it not the case that, if something has no nature of its own, then
training oneself in giving and the rest is meaningless? Because isn't it rather
true that a person engages in giving and the rest for achieving the goals of
Buddhahood and such, but all along with thoughts imbued by that wisdom
which realizes that these practices are false, like an illusion? One thus engages
in practices which do not exist in truth, but does so without actively
considering or examining their real nature. The fact is that, unless they are
imbued with the wisdom which realizes that things have no nature of their
own, the remaining perfections don't even deserve to be called "perfections."
And it is only when they are guided by the eyes of wisdom that the other five
perfections are able to make the journey to the city of all-knowingness.

What it Means When We Say Things Work

And those in the world do argue.

Someone may assert the following:
You do accept, as well as we do, the fact that we can see with our own eyes
objects such as a fire which has the ability to perform a function such as
cooking food or the like. Since this is what it means for us when we say that
something exists in truth, you and we have nothing to argue about. If on the
other hand you refuse that these objects exist, then you are disproved in a
great many ways--including the way you would then contradict what we can
all see with our own eyes.

Your argument though is one based on the idea that the two truths cannot
coexist: you think that if functional things have no nature of their own, then
they must not exist at all; and that if these things do exist, then they must exist
with some nature of their own. It is true that those in the world who are of the
Middle-Way school and those who are members of the group which asserts
that functional things must exist truly can both see things that function, such as
fire, with valid perception, and both therefore accept the existence of these
objects. Those who believe that functional things exist truly though imagine or
believe that these things exist purely; they cannot grasp the fact that they are
void of any true existence, that they are just like an illusion. Those of the
Middle-Way school though do grasp this fact, and thus there really is an
argument here between the "high practitioners," those of the Middle-Way school,
and those in the world who assert that things which perform a function exist
truly. By the way, you can also interpret the first reference to "those in the
world" here as applying only to those who assert that functional things exist
truly.

Things That Exist Deceptively Do Exist

Here is the first point, [a refutation of the idea that things could not exist even
deceptively.] One may make the following objection [regarding the Middle-Way
belief that perceptions about objects in deceptive reality are still valid]:
Even in the realm of deceptive reality, it is a contradiction to attempt to
prove that all produced things are changing, since functional things are
considered by the conventions of the world to be unchanging; that is, the
thing that is here in the evening is considered to be the very same thing
that was here in the morning, and so on.
Even though physical objects and the like are by convention considered
unchanging, it is not the case that there exists any contradiction where they
cannot be established by a valid perception as being changing. And this is true

because whether or not a thing is changing or such can be established by a
deceptive, valid perception which belongs to a high practitioner, and which is
operating in a merely nominal sense.

One may continue with the following objection:
But isn't it contradictory to say something like, "To see that things are
changing and such is to see thusness itself"?
It is not. This is only talking about the fact that we can see a "thusness" or a
real nature of certain things relative to what the world wrongly believes about
them--where the world believes, for example, that things are pure, happy,
unchanging, or the like. If this were not the case, and if everything that the
world agreed to by the conventions of the world were totally correct, then the
belief of the world that a woman's body is something pure would have to
disprove the perception of a high practitioner who is meditating upon the fact
of repulsiveness, and who ascertains correctly that a woman's body is
something impure.

Here is the second point, [a refutation of the idea that you could never
accumulate the collections needed to produce the body and mind of a Buddha].
One might continue with yet another objection:
Isn't it contradictory to say that things have no nature of their own, and
at the same time to state that a person can gain meritorious karma from
acts such as making offerings to the victorious Buddhas?
And yet it is no contradiction. It is in fact true that one obtains meritorious
karma from making offerings to victorious Buddhas who are themselves void of
any true existence--who are just like an illusion. Think of the way in which
you believe that meritorious karma comes relative to victorious Buddhas that
you think to exist as things which perform a function and which exist in truth.
This kind of karma actually does come from functional things just as you
thought, in exact accord with what they are, regardless of whether they are
true or not in the sense you take it.

Here is the third point, [a refutation of the idea that there could be no rebirth].
One may ask the following question as well:

If living beings lack any true existence, and are like an illusion, then how can
they take a rebirth after they die? Wouldn't they be similar to a being
created by a magical illusion; wouldn't they disappear once, and then
never come back?
It's not that we're asserting that a magical illusion and a living being are in
every respect alike. And if you claim that the problem you propose would
apply even to our limited analogy, consider the way in which you yourself
accept the fact that dreams and illusions are something false: it would be the
same as if you were asking, "If the object around which a magician creates his
illusion can appear as if it were a horse, then how come it can't appear as a
donkey?"

Remember too that even an illusion, although it is something false, will continue
to occur for exactly as long as all the different conditions needed for its occurrence
continue to be present together. Here the case is just the same: beings continue
to cross into a new rebirth just as long as ignorance and the other conditions
necessary for them to do so continue to be present together.

One may respond as follows:
It's not the same thing, because we are talking about living beings that
have been around for a very long time--for time with no beginning, in
fact.
How could it be though that, simply because they have been around for a longer
time, living beings must exist in truth? And that, because it is of a shorter

duration, an illusion must then be false? It is wrong for you to make a
necessary correlation between the duration of an object and its truth or
falsehood; if this held true, then since there are also differences in the duration
of magical illusions and dreams and the like, then you would have to accept
a distinction where some were more true and others were more false. This is
true for example because in some dreams you can think that an entire eon has
passed, while in others you can only remember the events of a single day.

Here is the fourth point, [a refutation of the idea that there would be no
distinction between good deeds and bad deeds]. One might return with yet
another objection:
When you say that living beings have no nature of their own, and that
they are like an illusion, don't you contradict the explanation that a
person who kills such a being collects a bad deed?
Remember though that, even if you attempt to kill or do any such act towards
a being who turns out to be only an illusion created by some magic, you still
strike with your weapon or whatever desiring to kill them, and conceiving of
them as an actual human being. And then you still collect the bad deed of
undertaking to kill someone, even though--since it had no mind--there is no bad
deed in the sense of the actual event. Suppose on the other hand that you act
towards a human or the like, those beings who do possess a mind which is itself
an illusory one. It is then the case that there do occur meritorious deeds when

One may continue with this question:
If they are all exactly the same in having no nature of their own, then
why is it that some of these objects occur with a mind, and others occur
without a mind?
The different things used to create an illusion, whether they be magic powders
or special incantations, have no power to create an illusion which also possesses
a mind. Therefore a mind can never happen with a horse or cow which is a
magical illusion. Even magical illusions though can occur in a great variety of
forms, coming as they do through a great variety of conditions. The word "even,"
by the way, is meant to indicate that this fact is not restricted to actual living
beings. The point is that there is never any case at all where a single condition
can create all the different kinds of results: for a variety of results to occur,
there must occur a variety of causes.

Here is the fifth point, [a refutation of the idea that there would be no fixed
distinction between the cycle of suffering and transcending this cycle]. Those
of the Middle-Way school say that there is no birth or aging or anything of the
like which exists in an ultimate way. They also assert that the fact that all
objects are void of any nature of their own is necessarily a natural state of
nirvana. They assert finally that the cycle of suffering consists of the events of
birth, aging, and the rest, all occurring through the power of karma and mental
afflictions. To these points the Sutrists make the following objection:
Suppose that if something is a kind of nirvana which exists ultimately, or
which comes by nature, then it is necessarily a kind of nirvana. Suppose
further that the fact that the cycle of suffering is void of any nature of its
own is itself this ultimate kind of nirvana; but that a person circles
around in this circle of suffering, in a stream of births and deaths, all as
a kind of deceptive reality. If this were true then there would have to exist
a thing which was, simultaneously, both the cycle of suffering and
nirvana. And in this case then Buddhas themselves would too be circling
around in the cycle of suffering. What then would the use be for
bodhisattvas to engage in the activities of a bodhisattva, in order to achieve
the state of Buddhahood? It would be totally pointless.
And yet there is no such problem, for there exists a distinction between the
natural state of nirvana and that nirvana which consists of a state of purity
which occurs through circumstances.

The nirvana which comes by nature is not something which depends upon
one's practice of the path; this is because it is, rather, the very nature of
everything, whether they involve any practice of the path or not. The nirvana
which occurs through circumstances, and consists of becoming free of all
impurity, must be achieved through cutting off the process through which, in
a stream of births and deaths, a person circles around in the cycle of suffering.
And even though these things may have no nature of their own, it is still the
case that, unless you cut off the stream of conditions that bring them about, you
would find it impossible not only to end the cycle of suffering, but ever to
bring even simple illusions to a stop. On the other hand, it would be impossible
for the cycle of suffering to happen even in a deceptive way, if one were able to
cut off the stream of the conditions which bring it about: conditions such as
ignorance and the like.

Incidentally, in the argument that came before, one should answer in terms of
distinguishing between an ultimate nirvana and nirvana, but not with any
other reply. This is because the opponent in this case also accepts the principle
that Buddhas do not circle around in the cycle of suffering, whereas living
beings do.

Contemplation Thirteen
How Do We See the Illusion?

,GNYIS PA SEMS TZAM PA'I 'DOD PA BYE BRAG TU DGAG PA LA 'DOD PA BRJOD PA DANG , DE DGAG PA'O,
Here is the second part: a more particular refutation, of the position of the
Mind-Only School. Here we will proceed in two steps: stating their position,
and then refuting it.

DANG PO NI, GAL TE CHOS THAMS CAD RANG BZHIN GYIS MED NA SGYU MA 'DZIN PA'I SHES PA 'KHRUL PA'ANG YOD PA MIN NA SGYU MA BLO GANG GIS DMIGS PAR 'GYUR TE, MI 'GYUR BAS SGYU MA'ANG 
MED PAR 'GYUR RO ZHE NA 'DI YANG YOD NA RANG BZHIN GYIS YOD DGOS SNYAM PA'I RTZOD PA'O,
Here is the first of the two. One may begin with the following objection:
If there is no object at all that has any nature of its own, then the
mistaken state of mind which perceives the illusion cannot exist either.
If this were so, then there would be no state of mind that could ever take
the illusion as its object. And if this were the case, then the illusion itself
could not exist either.
This argument too is another version of the idea that, if something exists, it
must have a nature of its own.

GNYIS PA LA RTZOD PA MTSUNGS PA DANG , DE'I LAN DGAG PA'O,
The second of the two has two sections of its own: a demonstration that the
same arguments apply to them instead, and then a refutation of their
attempted rebuttal in response to this demonstration.

,GANG TSE KHYOD LA SGYU MA NYID,
,MED NA'ANG DE TSE CI ZHIG DMIGS,
,GAL TE DE NYID DU GZHAN YOD,
,RNAM PA DE NI SEMS NYID YIN,
You would say there'd also
Be no illusion itself;
On what then would it focus?
Suppose those same exist
In another way; the forms
Consist of the mind itself.

GZUGS SGRA SOGS 'DZIN BYED KYANG MED PAR 'GYUR RO,
Here is the first. You of the Mind-Only School would say that, if things grasped
by the mind both appear to be outer objects and also actually exist the way
that they appear, then there must exist outer objects. In such a case then there
would be nothing that was like an illusion, and no state of mind that could
focus on it either. You would also say though that, if things that appeared to
be outer objects did not actually exist the way that they appear, then they
would have no nature; and then, according to you yourselves, these objects
could not exist at all. In this case then there would also be no illusion itself--that
is, no instance of the thing being grasped by mind appearing to be an outer
object. If this were the case, then what would it be that the mind was grasping
to--what would it be focusing upon? Because after all, there would also be no
state of mind at all that was grasping to visible objects, sounds, and so on.

GNYIS PA LA 'DOD PA BRJOD PA DANG , DE DGAG PA'O,
The second point has two steps of its own: stating the position of the Mind-
Only School, and then refuting this position.

DANG PO NI, KHO NA RE GAL TE PHYI ROL DON DU SNANG BA SNANG BA LTAR GYI DON DE NYID DU MED KYANG DE LAS GZHAN DU YOD DE GZUGS SOGS KYI RNAM PA DE NI SEMS NYID KYI RDZAS YIN NO ZHE NA,
Here is the first. The opponent may respond as follows:
Suppose it were true that the things which appear as outer objects do not
exist at all as those same objects, as what they appear to be. Nonetheless
they do exist in another way; that is, the forms that they take, as visible
objects and such, consist of the very substance of the mind itself.

,GANG TSE SEMS NYID SGYU MA NA,
,DE TSE GANG ZHIG GANG GIS MTHONG ,
Suppose the mind itself
Had the illusory; what
Would then see such?

GNYIS PA LA, GNYIS MED KYI SHES PA GANG GIS KYANG MA MTHONG BA DANG , DRIS PA'I LAN GYI RANG RIG DGAG PA'O,
The second step too has two parts: asking the opponent how the realization
that there are no two things could itself ever be perceived by any state of
mind; and refuting the self-perception of the mind that they propose in answer
to our question.

DANG PO NI, GANG GI TSE SEMS NYID SGYU MA LTA BU'I DON DU SNANG BA YIN GYI PHYI ROL GYI DON MED NA DE'I TSE DON DANG BRAL BA'I SHES PA GANG ZHIG TSAD MA GANG GIS MTHONG STE MTHONG BYED MED PAR 'GYUR RO,
Here is the first. Suppose it were the case that the mind itself was both having
the appearance that there was this illusory object, but that there was in fact no
outer object. In such a case, then the mind would lack any object. What valid
perception then would there be to see just such a state of mind? There could
never exist then any state of mind that saw it.

,'JIG RTEN GYI NI MGON POS KYANG ,

,RAL GRI SO NI RANG LA RANG ,

The Savior of the World
Himself has stated
That "mind can't see the mind."
The mind's the same as the
Blade of a sword,
Which could never cut itself.

Here is the second. The Mind-Only School says that there are two parts to the
mind: an object-oriented part which focuses outwardly, and a subject-oriented
part which only focuses inwardly; and that the latter is the direct self-
perception of the mind, and that it is this state of mind which perceives all
states of mind. We will cover the present point then in four parts: refuting this
idea through the use of scriptural authority; refuting it through the use of
reasoning; refuting proofs used to support the existence of the self-perception
of the mind; and refuting the position that nominally-existing entities could
rely upon functional things that existed truly.

DANG PO NI, SHES PA DE NYID KYIS DE NYID GNYIS SNANG NUB PA'I TSUL GYIS MYONG ZHING RIG PA MI 'THAD DE, 'JIG RTEN GYI NI MGON POS KYANG GTZUG NA RIN PO CHE'I MDO LAS RAL GRI'I SO DE NYID KYIS RAL GRI'I SO DE NYID BCAD PAR MI NUS PA SOGS DPER BZHAG NAS SEMS KYIS SEMS MI MTHONG ZHES GSUNGS SO, , DPER NA RAL GRI'I SO NI RANG LA RANG GIS CI LTAR YANG MI GCOD PA DE BZHIN DU YID KYIS YID MI MTHONG NGO ,
Here is the first. It is incorrect to say that the mind could experience, could
know, itself, in a way where the duality was repressed. The Savior of the World
has himself stated that the mind cannot see itself; he did so in the Sutra Requested
by Crowning Jewel, through using examples such as the fact that the blade of a
sword cannot cut itself. "How, for example, could the blade of a sword ever cut
the blade of a sword? The mind is the same: it could never see the mind itself."

Those who accept the idea of a self-perception of the mind accept the concept
that the subject-oriented part of the mind could perceive itself. In such a case,
there could not be a single atom of a chance here that the thing being
perceived and the thing perceiving it could ever appear to the mind in any
way that was not exactly the same. One would have to accept then that they
were one and the same thing which could never even appear in different

versions. If one accepted this kind of self-perception of the mind, then one
would have to accept ideas like the blade of a sword cutting itself. And one
would also have to accept ideas like a valid perception that engaged in its
object without having to rely upon this object in any way.

One may claim, "It's just like
A lamp which illumines
The thing that's itself."
But a lamp isn't the illumined,
For the reason that there's no such
Thing as darkness shrouding.

GNYIS PA LA, DPE DGAG PA DANG , DON DGAG PA'O,
Here next we begin the refutation through reasoning. We first refute the
opponent's illustration, and then refute their point.

DANG PO LA, MAR ME'I DPE DGAG PA NI, JI LTAR TE DPER NA MAR ME RANG GI DNGOS PO DANG GZHAN GYI DNGOS PO GNYIS YANG DAG PAR GSAL BAR BYED PA BZHIN DU, SHES PAS KYANG RANG GZHAN GNYIS KA RIG PAR BYED PA YIN NO ZHE NA,
Here is the first, beginning with the refutation of the illustration of a lamp.
One may make the following claim:
It's just like the following illustration. Think of a lamp, which illuminates
both the thing that it is itself, and also other things. The mind is the same:
it perceives both itself, and other things as well.

DPE MA GRUB STE MAR ME RANG GIS RANG GSAL BAR BYED PA MA YIN TE MAR ME RANG GIS GSAL BAR BYA BA MIN PA'I PHYIR TE RANG GIS RANG GSAL MI DGOS SHING MI NUS PA'I PHYIR RO,

But your example does not hold true. A lamp is not something which
illuminates itself, because it is not something which is the object illuminated by
it. There is no need for it to illuminate itself, and it could never do so anyway.
If it could, then darkness too shroud both itself and other objects. This though
could never be, for the reason that there is no such thing as darkness shrouding
darkness. If it did shroud darkness, then it would be like shrouding a vase
with a piece of cloth, and we would be unable to see the darkness itself. For
these points I am enlarging upon statements found in the Root Text on Wisdom
[by the realized being Nagarjuna].

We turn now to a refutation of the illustration of a piece of crystal. One may
make yet another claim, as follows:
It's like a piece of crystal. Think of a clear piece of crystal: considered in
its original condition, it could never assume a blue hue unless it were due
to the influence of some other object--never by virtue of its own essence.
The blueness of a piece of lapis though is something that assumes a blue
hue by its own essence; it is not something which must rely upon another
thing to be the way it is. Just so, the perception of certain objects like
visible forms must rely on something else, upon a mind; whereas the mind
itself can be seen even without our relying on anything else to perceive it,
for it perceives itself.
Your example though, of a blueness of lapis which assumes its blueness
without any other cause to help it do so, has to be incorrect. This is true
because the blueness of blue itself is not something which has not come about
through its own causes; blueness is not something that could ever make itself
something blue, all by itself.

Here is the refutation of our opponent's point. Suppose then that you say, "Even
though a lamp does not illuminate itself, a lamp is illumination itself"--and you
say, "The mind does know itself." If you talk this way then you are saying that
the mind is not something which illuminates itself; but rather, you are saying in
effect, it is illumination itself. And yet it is improper for you to talk this way,
for you have not told us what state of mind which was different from the mind
itself could perceive it.

And if it took yet another state of mind to perceive this one, the whole process
would become endless. In this case then the mind would be perceived neither
by itself nor by something else; and at this point then there would be no
perceiver at all that saw the mind. So it would become meaningless to talk of any
distinction between the mind's being illumination or not, since the very thing
that was supposed to have this quality or not would itself be something that
a valid perception could never establish as existing at all. It would be like
discussing the way that the daughter of a mule carried herself, when the daughter
of a mule is a complete impossibility in the first place.

The third point, [refuting proofs used to support the existence of the self-
perception of the mind,] covers two points of its own: an illustration to show
how, even though there is no self-perception of the mind, memory can still
occur; and a refutation of the idea that, if there is no self-perception of the
mind, then there can be no perception of the mind by something else.

Here is the first. [One might ask:] "If there were no such thing as self-perception
of the mind, then how could we ever remember the consciousness which was the
subject in an act of perception? We never could."

We are able though to deduce that, for the reason we do remember something,
then we must have had an initial experience of it. When for example we say
to ourselves, "I saw something blue, earlier," we are having a memory. A
memory is something that follows from an initial experience, and so when we
say "I saw something blue," and thereby remember the object of our
perception, we can establish the fact that there must have been an initial
experience of this object. And it is the thing which had this experience of the
object which we refer to as the perception of something blue.

One may make the following claim:
When you say "I saw," you remember the subject of the perception, and
it is based on this reason that you can say that there was an experience
of the subject. The experiencer of the subject in this case is a self-
perception of the mind. Moreover, this self-perception of the mind can
be established as true through the kind of logic where you eliminate
other possibilities, in investigating just what it is that experiences the
state of mind which is perceiving blue.

It is not the case though that, because we can remember the subject, some self-
perception of the mind is proven to be true. When the state of mind which
perceives blue experiences the object which is something other than it--that is,
blue--the memory of the subject is actually caused by remembering a relationship:
by remembering the connection between the object and the subject, when you
say the words, "I saw this blue thing before." It is not though that the memory
of the subject is caused by an experience of the subject; it is rather like the case
where, although [a hibernating animal] has no experience of the poison that
comes from being bitten by a rat at the time when the rat bites it, [the
hibernating animal] still remembers it later on.

,DPER NA DGUN GYI DUS SU BYI BAS LUS LA RMUGS PA NA BYI DUG ZHUGS YOD KYANG RMUGS PA MYONG GI DUG MA MYONG NGO, , DE LAS DUS PHYIS 'BRUG GI SGRA THOS PA NA RMUGS PA'I TSE DUG ZHUGS PAR 'DUG SNYAM DU DRAN KYANG SNGAR GYI TSE DUG MA MYONG BA BZHIN NO,
Think for example of a case where a rat bites the body [of a hibernating
animal] during the wintertime. Even though the poison that comes from the
rat bite has entered the body, the poison is not experienced--although the bite
itself is. At some later point in time, [the hibernating animal] hears the sound
of [springtime] thunder, [is awakened from hibernation,] and has a memory
wherein it thinks to itself, "The poison must have entered my body when I was
bitten." It is not the case though that the animal had an experience of the
poison prior to this time. The situation here is the same:

,DE LA BYI BAS RMUGS PA NI SNGO 'DZIN GYIS YUL MYONG BA BZHIN NO, , RMUGS PA DANG DUS GCIG TU DUG ZHUGS PA NI YUL BZUNG BA DANG DUS GCIG TU YOD PA'I YUL CAN GYI MYONG BA DANG 'DRA'O, , DE'I TSE YUL CAN RANG GIS RANG MA MYONG BA NI RMUGS PA'I TSE DUG MA MYONG BA DANG 'DRA'O, , PHYIS RMUGS PA DRAN PA NI YUL MYONG BA DRAN PA DANG 'DRA'O, , YUL MYONG DRAN PA NYID KYIS SNGAR GYI YUL CAN KHO RANG GIS KHO RANG MA MYONG YANG DRAN PA NI RMUGS PA DRAN PA NYID KYI MTHUS SNGAR ZHUGS PA'I DUG MA MYONG BA DRAN PA DANG 'DRA'O,
Being bitten by the rat is an analogy for the experience of the object by the
state of mind which perceives something blue. The fact that the poison has
entered the body at the same time as the bite occurred is an analogy for the
experience of a subject which exists at the same time that the object was
perceived. The fact that, at this particular moment, the subject does not
experience itself is represented by the way in which the poison has not been
experienced at the time when the bite occurred. Remembering the bite later
on is the same as remembering the experience of the object. The fact that we
remember the subject solely because we remember the object (even without the
previous subject ever experiencing itself) is similar to the fact that, solely
through the power of remembering the bite, we remember the poison which
entered the body but which was not experienced.

This line of reasoning, set out by the Lord of All Great Masters, explains how
memory can occur even without any self-perception of the mind, and is clearly
something which is completely amazing. It seems as though others who have
commented upon the Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life have been unable to
give their readers a full appreciation of these points.

How Buddhas Take Offerings

,MTSUNGS PA NYID DU BSHAD PHYIR RO,
"How can we gain a result
From making offerings to those
Who possess no state of mind?"
It is because of the explanation
That it's the same with those who are present
And those passed to nirvana.

Here is the second point, [which is refuting an attempted argument about the
demonstration of how it is correct to say that, even though the Buddhas have
no conceptualization, they can still fulfill all the hopes of their disciples].
Now some Listeners have made the following argument:
Buddhas possess no conceptual state of mind, and so neither do they have
that conceptual state of mind in which one accepts an offering. How then
can we gain a meritorious result from making offerings to them?

MDO LAS BSHAD PA'I PHYIR RO,
Isn't it though the case that, even though Buddhas have no conceptual state of
mind, we can still obtain merit through making offerings to them? You may
ask our reason for saying so; it is because of the explanation, found in the Sutra
on the Lion's Roar of Loving One, that whether a person makes an offering to a
Buddha who is actually present, or else makes the same offering to their tomb
after they have passed into nirvana, the merit from the act is exactly the same.

The Book on the Benefits of Circling an Offering Shrine states as well that:
There is no difference at all in the merit
Of those who with equal thoughts of faith
Make offerings to One still living, or to
The tomb of One passed to nirvana.

It doesn't matter whether

The result is in the Word.

As the result you'd obtain
From that to a Buddha in truth.

It is stated in the Word of the Buddha that it doesn't matter whether an act such
as making offerings to a Buddha exists deceptively or even in an ultimate way:
the result of making the offering still occurs. It's just the same, for example, as the
result that you yourselves believe would be obtained from making that same
offering to a Buddha who existed in truth. The point here is that, suppose we
leave for a moment any examination into the real nature of things. What we
are trying to say is that, regardless of whether the thing is true or false, we can
be satisfied simply with the fact that we obtain a result which corresponds
exactly to the object involved.

Course XII: Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life, Part III
Reading Four: Contemplations on the Perfection of Wisdom,
Part IV
The following contemplations are based on the Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way
of Life (Bodhisattvacharyavatara; Byang-chub-sems-dpa'i spyod-pa la 'jug-pa) of the
Buddhist master Shantideva (circa 700 AD), and the commentary upon it by
Gyaltsab Je Darma Rinchen (1364-1432) entitled Entry Point for Children of the
Victorious Buddhas (rGyal-sras 'jug-ngogs). The relevant sections are found at
folios 32A-33A and 128B-133B, respectively, in the ACIP electronic editions
TD3871 and S5436.
The content of the contemplations is translated directly from the root text and
commentary; the names of the contemplations are not a part of the original
text, but are based on the divisions of Gyaltsab Je's commentary and have been
supplied for reference. Each lesson is accompanied by the full detailed outline
for the section from Gyaltsab Je's commentary.

On the Need to See Emptiness

,BDEN PA MTHONG BAS GROL 'GYUR GYI,
,STONG NYID MTHONG BAS CI ZHIG BYA,
,GANG PHYIR LUNG LAS LAM 'DI NI,

"One achieves liberation by
Seeing the truth; what's though
The point of seeing emptiness?"

It's because scripture states that,
Without this path,
There is never enlightenment.

,GNYIS PA THAR PA TZAM THOB PAR 'DOD PAS KYANG STONG NYID RTOGS DGOS PAR BSGRUB PA LA, RTZOD PA DANG , LAN NO,
The second part--a proof that, even if all you hope to do is to reach freedom,
you must still realize emptiness--will proceed in two steps: the opponent's
argument and our own response.

DANG PO NI, NYAN THOS SDE PA KHA CIG NA RE BDEN PA BZHI'I RNAM PA MI RTAG SOGS BCU DRUG MNGON SUM DU MTHONG BA GOMS PAS GROL BA DGRA BCOM PA'I 'BRAS BU THOB PAR 'GYUR GYI, CHOS THAMS CAD BDEN PAS STONG PA NYID MTHONG BAS CI ZHIG BYA DGOS PA MED CING MI RIGS SO ZHE NA,
Here is the first. Some people from the Listener group make the following
claim:
One achieves liberation--the goal of becoming an enemy destroyer--by
habituating oneself to the experience of seeing, directly, the sixteen aspects
of the four truths: impermanence and the rest. What though would be the
point of seeing that all existing objects were empty of any true existence?
There would be no purpose served; it could never be right.

There are other Listener groups who say that you don't even need to realize
emptiness in order to achieve enlightenment. And not only that; they don't
even accept the term "lack of any self-nature to things." Neither do they accept
that the sutras of the greater way are the word of the Buddha. These kinds of
people are the primary opponent in the present case. We are by the way
though also refuting here those people who do consider the sutras of the
greater way to be authentic, but who assert that one need not realize the lack
of a self-nature to things in order to achieve the goal of becoming an enemy
destroyer. The root text at this point is put here with the idea of refuting these
parties, and then expressing the position that it is only wisdom which can be
proven as the path to liberate oneself from a suffering existence.

GNYIS PA LA GSUM, STONG NYID RTOGS PA'I SHES RAB DE NYID SRID PA LAS GROL BA'I LAM DU BSGRUB PA DANG , MI GNAS PA'I MYA NGAN LAS 'DAS PA'I LAM DU BSGRUB PA DANG , DES NA GROL BA DON GNYER GYIS STONG NYID BSGOM RIGS PAR GDAMS PA'O, , DANG PO LA THEG PA CHEN PO'I MDO SDE BKAR LUNG GIS SGRUB PA'I SGO NAS BSGRUB PA DANG , RIGS PAS BSGRUB PA'O,
The second step has three parts of its own: proving that it is only the wisdom
that realizes emptiness which is the path that can liberate one from a suffering
existence; proving that it is also only this wisdom which is the path for
reaching the nirvana where one no longer remains in the two extremes; and
advice to those who seek to attain liberation, that it is therefore very right that
they should meditate upon emptiness. The first of these has two sections:
proving this fact by using scripture to prove that the scriptures of the greater
way are the word of the Buddha; and proving the fact through logic.

DANG PO NI, NYAN RANG DGRA BCOM PA'I 'BRAS BU THOB PA LA YANG STONG NYID RTOGS PA NGES PAR DGOS PAR THAL, RGYU MTSAN GANG GI PHYIR NA SHES RAB KYI PHA ROL TU PHYIN PA'I MDO SDE'I LUNG LAS STONG NYID RTOGS PA'I LAM 'DI NI GOMS PA MED PAR BYANG CHUB GSUM GA THOB PA MED PAR GSUNGS PA'I PHYIR RO,
Here is the first. It is true though that one must definitely realize emptiness
even to achieve the goal of becoming an enemy destroyer. This is because of
the fact that scriptural authority, in the form of the body of sutras devoted to
the perfection of wisdom, states that--without habituating oneself to this path,

where you realize emptiness--one can never reach the three "states of
enlightenment."

The Great Commentary to the Guide quotes the Sutra of the Mother as saying that
"those who still conceive of [self-existent] things" can never reach freedom; and
that reaching total enlightenment--as well as everything from the level of a
stream-enterer up to the state of a self-made "Buddha"--all depends upon this
one thing: the perfection of wisdom. The intent of the root text at this point
is to reflect these statements; it is not meant to indicate that this perfection is
needed only for the matchless state of enlightenment.

GNYIS PA LA GNYIS, MGO MTSUNGS GIS BSGRUB PA DANG , RNAL MA'I RIGS PAS BSGRUB PA'O,
Here is the second point, [using logic to prove the fact that it is only the
wisdom that realizes emptiness which is the path that can liberate one from a
suffering existence]. We proceed in two steps: proving this fact through a
parallel argument; and proving it through specific reasoning.

Here is the first. What if someone says the following:
The group of sutras belonging to the greater way is not, according to my
belief, the word of the Buddha; nor do I accept that these sutras are
authoritative. Therefore they are not, for me, something which is true. If
you put these forth as evidence for proving your statement that realizing
emptiness is a path for the Listener and Self-Made Buddha groups as
well, then the thing you are using to prove your statement and the
statement you are trying to prove are just the same!

KHYOD KYI LUNG KHYOD RANG TSAD MAR 'DOD PA'I THEG DMAN GYI SDE SNOD 'DI RNAMS DKA' YIN PAR JI LTAR GRUB DRIS PAS DE DAG BKA' YIN TE, , GANG GI PHYIR NA 'U BU CAG GNYIS KA LA THEG PA DMAN PA'I MDO SDE 'DI BKAR GRUB BO ZHE NA,
We ask them then the following question: "Consider the scriptures which you
assert are authoritative: the collection of scriptures of the lower way. Just how
are they truly the word of the Buddha?"
And they answer: "They are truly the word of the Buddha because the scriptural
collection of the lower way is considered by the both of us--by both your group
and ours--as being the word of the Buddha."

RGYU MTSAN KUN NAS MTSUNGS TE KHYOD SKYES MA THAG PA DANG LUNG DON RIGS PAS GTAN LA MA PHEBS PA'I DANG PO KHYOD LA YANG DMAN PA'I SDE SNOD 'DI TSAD MAR MA GRUB LA, DUS PHYIS LUNG TSAD MAR KHAS LEN PA'I RKYEN TE THABS DAG GANG 'DUL BA LA GNANG , MDO SDE LA 'JUG, MNGON PA'I CHOS NYID DANG MI 'GAL BAR 'JUG PA'I CHEN PO BSTAN PA SOGS LUNG DON RIGS PAS GTAN LA 'BEBS PA'I THABS GANG GIS NI LUNG TSAD MA DER YID CHES PAR SGRUB PA'I SGRUB BYED DE NI THEG CHEN GYI MDO SDE LA YANG MTSUNGS PAR YOD PA'I PHYIR RO,
Then for the very same reason you should accept those of the greater way. At
first--meaning right after you were born, and also before you were able to
come to an understanding of their meaning through the use of reasoning--not
even the scriptural collection of the lower way was something that for you was
truly authoritative. Later on though you came to believe that the Teaching of
the Great was authoritative, because you applied those various methods which
establish it as being so, through both scriptural authority and through logic.
These are the different conditions or methods that allow one to accept scripture
as authoritative; that is, it should appear [reading snang for gnang, as do other
commentaries in the Tengyur, and as Gyaltsab Je's own commentary does later
on] in the scriptures on vowed morality; it should relate to the collection of
sutras; and it should not contradict the teachings of the "real Dharma,"
meaning the scriptures on higher knowledge--[in short, it should present the
three trainings, as found in the three collections of scripture]. These tests for
proving that a scripture is authoritative apply exactly the same to the scriptures
of the greater way as they do to those of the lower way.

If this were not the case, and if a scripture were truly authoritative whenever
any two people at all accepted that it was, then texts like the "Books of Knowledge"
[the Vedas of the non-Buddhists] and such would have to be true as well. Why
so? Because you could always find two people who believed they were
authoritative.

In the next moment after.

Here is the second point, [which is the absurd consequence that, if one could
reach the state of an enemy destroyer simply through the path of the sixteen
aspects of impermanence and the rest, then one would have to reach it through
nothing more than eliminating mental afflictions in their manifest form].
Someone may make the following claim:
It's not necessary that a person realize emptiness in order to achieve the
state of an enemy destroyer. It is rather through habituating oneself to
the path by which one realizes the sixteen aspects of impermanence and
so on that a person finally eliminates all their mental afflictions, and thus
attains liberation: the goal of becoming an enemy destroyer.

You must be saying then that a person who eliminates, temporarily, nothing
more than the manifest form of mental afflictions becomes--in the next moment
after they eliminate such manifest forms--this enemy destroyer. Why so?
Because, according to you, a person is able to finish off their mental afflictions,
and thus attain the state of an enemy destroyer, by habituating themselves to
nothing more than the path of the sixteen aspects of impermanence and the
rest. The logic is completely the same, in every way.

And yet you cannot accept that this could be the case. Consider the kinds of
people who, temporarily, lack any manifest mental afflictions: those who have
eliminated no more than the manifest forms. We can see though that they still
possess the karmic power that would cause them to cross the border into their
next rebirth.

The lines in the root text that say "If one were liberated by eliminating
afflictions..." are a statement of the opponent's position; their purpose is similar
to the lines before that went, "One achieves liberation by seeing the truth." The
former lines should be explained as saying, "If a person eliminated their mental
afflictions, and thereby attained liberation, by means of meditating upon the path
of the sixteen aspects of impermanence and the rest..." This is because the
debate at this point is about whether or not one can attain liberation from the
mental afflictions solely by using the path of the sixteen aspects of
impermanence and the rest. Moreover, the fact that they should be explained
this way is totally obvious from the debate about liberation occurring "through
seeing the truth," and so on. As such, it is not at all the point of these lines to
say that, "Although we accept that the path of the sixteen aspects of
impermanence and the rest has the power to eliminate your mental afflictions,
this doesn't mean you are liberated then from every kind of suffering."

,DE'I PHYIR LAM DES NYAN THOS SDE PA GNYIS DANG THUN MONG BA'I NYON MONGS SU BZHAG PA RNAMS SNGAR BSHAD PA LTAR GYI LAM RGYUD LA BSKYED PAS RE SHIG MNGON GYUR DU RGYU BA MED PA'I TSE, NYON MONGS ZAD PA'I GROL BA THOB PAR 'JOG NA NYON MONGS MNGON GYUR TZAM RE SHIG SPANGS PAS DE'I DE MA THAG TU ZAG PA THAMS CAD ZAD PA'I GROL BA THOB PAR 'GYUR RO ZHES 'GOG PA DGONGS PA YIN NO,
Suppose then that this path functions as follows: when one develops in their
mind the path described above, then it affects those thoughts which are
accepted by both the two Listener groups and by ourselves as being mental
afflictions--it stops them from operating in a manifest manner, temporarily.
If one were to posit that this constituted achieving a liberation wherein all
mental afflictions were finished off, then one would have to say that a person
had achieved a liberation where every impurity was finished off simply by
having eliminated, temporarily, the manifest form of the mental
afflictions--and this would have to happen in the very next moment after it.
The intent of the root text at this point is to refute this idea.

The fact that one cannot accept the position just stated is indicated in the lines
of the root text at this point which say, "They lack any mental afflictions; / We
can see though they still / Possess the karmic power." [If what you say is true,
then] these lines are saying that "even though a person may, temporarily, not
possess the manifest form of mental afflictions, we can see that they will not
be able to project him, through the power of karma, into another future life."

This is how one should explain the lines of the root text at this point. Some
commentaries though, and certain Tibetans, have explained them as saying:
Consider persons like Maudgalyayana and the realized being "String of
Fingers," who had no mental afflictions, but who still had karma that they
had collected earlier, when they were still ordinary beings. We can see
that this karma was still producing a result and giving them suffering, so
it is not true that they were liberated right after losing their mental
afflictions.
This interpretation of the lines though is not correct. The lines are not referring
to the ability of the karma to produce suffering in this present life, but rather
to its ability to project the person into another future life. The point is that,
because one has not yet stopped their ability to do this, then one has not yet
achieved liberation.

People who have not yet realized emptiness have failed to eliminate even the
slightest bit of that ignorance which consists of grasping to the true existence
of their feelings. As such, there will definitely grow within them the kinds of
craving brought about by their feelings; that is, the craving not to be separated
from feelings of pleasure, and the craving to be separated from feelings of
pain. Now those kinds of people that you say are enemy destroyers still
though possess the belief that feelings can exist by definition. But the fact is
that--so long as there remains in the continuum of any particular person a
manifest form of the state of mind which still possesses the tendency to look at
things as if they were true--then it is totally impossible that this person could
have put a stop to the manifest form of the craving which is instigated by this
tendency.

Here is the fourth point: [a demonstration of why, therefore, even those who
wish to achieve no more than freedom must still meditate upon emptiness].
Consider now the state of mind which still lacks the realization that the person
and his heaps are empty of any nature where they could exist by definition.
Even though people with this state of mind have succeeded temporarily in
stopping the manifest form of their mental afflictions, these manifest forms will
still come back again. It's just like staying in the deep meditation where you
[nearly] stop completely your tendency to draw any kind of distinctions. So
therefore one must definitely hold the position that anyone who might hope
to achieve the goal of becoming an enemy destroyer--much less an Omniscient
One--must still meditate upon the emptiness which refuses the subtle form of the
self-existent object, whose existence we deny.

,DE LTAR STONG PA NYID PHYOGS LA,

,STONG PA NYID NI BSGOM PAR BYA,
As such, overthrowing those
Who accept the idea of emptiness
Is completely incorrect.
And so it is that, beyond
A shadow of a doubt, they must
Meditate upon emptiness.

Here is the third point, [which is advice to those who seek to attain liberation,
that it is therefore very right that they should meditate upon emptiness]. As
such--that is, as we have just explained--the case is that all these attempts to
overthrow those who accept the idea of emptiness are completely incorrect. They will
also be disproved by the various kinds of reasoning which we will present
later on. And so it is that even those who wish no more than to achieve the
"enlightenment" which is the goal of the Listener and "Self-Made Buddha"
tracks must still, beyond a shadow of a doubt, meditate upon emptiness, for the
following reason. The tendency to hold things as existing truly is that form of
ignorance, involved with mental affliction, which is the root of the circle of
suffering. And it is completely impossible to attain freedom unless one can
overthrow the existence of the object which this ignorance thinks it sees.

The wisdom which realizes emptiness is, moreover, the antidote for the darkness
of both the mental-affliction obstacles and the obstacles to knowledge. How could it
ever be then that--if you hoped to achieve quickly the state of omniscience, the
state where you end finally both the obstacles--you would neglect to go and
meditate upon emptiness? Without this, you would never be able to eliminate
even the seeds of the mental-affliction obstacles.

The seed for the obstacles to omniscience is the ultimate subtle mental potential
for things which involve mental affliction, and their manifest form is the
condition of things appearing to exist truly, and so on. It is wrong though to
say things like, if something appears to exist truly, it is then necessarily an
obstacle to omniscience.

We will now summarize our discussion. Someone might come and say, "This
thing you call emptiness is something that frightens me; I don't think I can
meditate on it." This thing we call the tendency to grasp to things as existing
truly though is the thing which we have identified as the main cause that creates
every kind of pain in this cycle of suffering. This is the thing you should feel
frightened about, this is the thing that should strike terror into your heart. Why
is it then that you feel any fear for the wisdom which realizes emptiness, for the
thing it is that will put a final end to all the pain of the cycle of suffering? It is
wrong for you to feel afraid about that very thing that ends all fear.

Only if it were true that there were any self-nature of anything at all then would it
be right for you to feel fear towards any object at all, since this fear comes from
believing in a self-nature. But since it is not the case that anything has any
nature at all which exists by nature, how could there be anyone who is afraid in the
first place? Take this state of mind where you think that things have any
nature of their own, and turn it around: look inside, and think! You will come
to comprehend fully what it means when we say that nothing is itself at all, and
you will liberate yourself from every fear there could ever be.

The following contemplations are based on the Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way
of Life (Bodhisattvacharyavatara; Byang-chub-sems-dpa'i spyod-pa la 'jug-pa) of the
Buddhist master Shantideva (circa 700 AD), and the commentary upon it by
Gyaltsab Je Darma Rinchen (1364-1432) entitled Entry Point for Children of the
Victorious Buddhas (rGyal-sras 'jug-ngogs). The relevant sections are found at
folios 33A-33B and 133B-137B, respectively, in the ACIP electronic editions
TD3871 and S5436.
The content of the contemplations is translated directly from the root text and
commentary; the names of the contemplations are not a part of the original
text, but are based on the divisions of Gyaltsab Je's commentary and have been
supplied for reference. Each lesson is accompanied by the full detailed outline
for the section from Gyaltsab Je's commentary.

Contemplation Twenty-Two
The Two Kinds of Grasping to Self-Existence

The third major section is a detailed explanation of the different types of
reasoning used to prove emptiness. Here there are two divisions: a detailed
presentation of the types of reasoning used to prove that the person has no
self-nature; and a detailed presentation of the types of reasoning used to prove
that things have no self-nature.

DANG PO LA GSUM, LHAN SKYES KYI BDAG 'DZIN GYI ZHEN YUL DGAG PA DANG , KUN BRTAGS KYI BDAG DGAG PA DANG , BKAG PA LA RTZOD PA SPANG BA'O,
The first of these has two parts of its own: refuting the object believed in by
the innate tendency to grasp to some self-nature; refuting the self-nature
grasped to by the tendency which is learned; and disproving any attempted
argument concerning the refutations.

Here is the first. On this point, the difference between the learned and the
innate forms of the tendency to grasp things as true is as follows. What we
call the "innate" form of this grasping can focus either on the person or upon
the parts of the person. It is a state of mind that everyone has, whether their
opinions have been affected by any particular school of philosophy or not.
And it holds that things exist through some nature of their own--that they
exist by definition. It is not dependent on any logical examination of its object,
but rather comes up in the mind automatically.

   BDEN 'DZIN YIN YANG RIGS PA'I DPYAD PA ZHUGS PA LA LTOS NAS BDEN PAR GRUB PA 'THAD SNYAM PA DANG , BDEN PA GRUB SNYAM PA NI BDEN 'DZIN KUN BRTAGS YIN LA,
An intellectual grasping to things as being true is a type of grasping to true
existence, but one which does rely on engaging in a logical analysis, and which
then concludes that it is correct to say that things do exist in truth, and so
believes in this kind of existence.

Regarding the tendency to grasp to the person as having some self-nature,
there does also exist a type where one holds the person as being self-standing
and substantial; this is taken in by the innate type just mentioned. You should
understand though that the tendency of looking upon the person and his parts
as being like a master and his servants can only be an intellectual type. In the
same way, the tendency to hold that there exists an atomic particle which is
partless, as well as the tendency to hold that there exists a moment of
consciousness which is partless, can both only be an intellectual type of the
tendency to hold that objects [meaning the parts of a person] have some self-
nature.

In brief, the two forms of the kind of tendency to grasp to things as existing
truly which comes in the mind automatically, without relying on analysis
according to some philosophical school, are the innate type. All the other
tendencies to hold that things have some self-nature are the intellectual kind.
It should be understood that the principal object which we deny when we
speak of emptiness is the object that the former tendency believes in;
disproving the object believed in by the latter tendency is ancillary to
disproving that believed in by the former.

One may make the following objection:
Here you are attempting to disprove the fact that the teeth and nails and
so on could be a self. If you are doing so with the idea that it could
liberate someone, then you are mistaken, since living beings tend to hold
these things as being "mine," and not as being "me."

The point here is the same as in places where, for example, it's stated that the
physical body is not the self. As such, the things focused upon for the two
objects that are pictured in the mind during the innate form of the view of
destruction are the simple "me" which serves as the basis for the workings of
karma and its consequences, as well as the simple thing which is delineated as
"mine." The view of destruction focuses upon these things and believes them
to be a "me" and "mine" which exist by definition. Given all this, then if the
"me" were to exist by definition, it would also be true that the collection of the
heaps, and their continued existence, and all its components and parts, and
anything completely separate from these things at all, any of them, would have
to constitute what "me" refers to. The fact though is that none of these things
constitutes anything of the kind. This is what is being expressed at this point.

Here is our refutation that the individual members of the various heaps could
ever be what "myself" refers to. Neither my teeth nor nails are myself; the bones
and blood are not what "myself" refers to; neither is the snot, nor the phlegm; all
these are, rather, only something which the idea of a "me" is imposed upon,
and nothing more. Nor is the lymph, nor the pus, what "me" refers to; and the
fat and particles of the body are nothing that "myself" refers to either--for the
exact same reasons that we mentioned earlier.

Neither are the lungs or the liver what "myself" refers to, nor are any of the other
organs, like the intestines, what "myself" refers to either. I am not my feces,
nor my urine; I am neither the flesh nor skin; all I am is an idea imposed upon
all these, nothing more. Neither the warmth of the body nor the inner winds
are myself, and I am not the aperture in me, or anything of the kind--we must
decide, finally, that I am none of them.

These points may be summarized as follows. Those who belong to the
Functionalist group hold the heaps to be the thing which "person" refers to.
The non-Buddhists assert that the person is like the master, and the heaps like
the servants; that is, they accept a person which is substantially different from
the heaps.

,'DIR BSTAN PA 'DI DAG NI DBU MA RIN CHEN PHRENG BA LAS KHAMS DRUG GANG ZAG YIN PA BKAG PA DANG DON GCIG PAS SO, , BU GA MIN ZHES PA NI NAM MKHA'I KHAMS GANG ZAG YIN PA BKAG PA YIN NO,
The presentation here is making exactly the same point as the refutation, found
in the String of Precious Jewels for the Middle Way, where it is denied that the six
categories could ever be the person himself. The word "aperture" is used to
deny the idea that the category called "space" could be a person either.

Therefore it would be wrong to consider, even nominally, either the whole of
the parts of a person, or the stream of the mind, or any of the components or
parts of a person to be the thing we refer to as the "person." Neither is there
anything that can we decide is the person and which is essentially different
from these things. Therefore the simple fact of the matter is that the person is
something which is merely imposed upon all these.

Someone may make the following objection:
If that's the case, then we could never find any person at all!
Are you saying then that it's not all right to talk about a "John" or a "Joe" or
anything of the like without going into some analysis about their nature?
Suppose you do accept the existence of a person who was the object referred
to by the term "person," and who also existed by definition. It's important for
you to understand that you would then be falling into either the extreme of
believing that all things are unchanging, or that they have discontinued
completely. As such, there is not a single atom of any such person at all.

Karma and its Consequences, Despite No Self

GSUM PA LA GNYIS, LAS 'BRAS MI 'THAD PAR THAL BA SPANG BA DANG , SNYING RJE BSGOM PA MI 'THAD PAR THAL BA SPANG BA'O, , DANG PO LA GNYIS, RTZOD PA DANG , LAN NO,
The third part, [disproving any attempted argument concerning the refutations
just presented], has two steps of its own: disproving the idea that the principle
of karma and its consequences would have to be incorrect, and disproving the
idea that it would be incorrect to meditate upon compassion. The first of these
itself has two sections: the opponent's argument, and our response to this
argument.

,GAL TE BDAG NI YOD MIN NA,
,LAS 'BRAS 'BREL PA RIGS MIN TE,
,LAS BYAS NAS NI ZHIG PAS NA,
,SU YI LAS SU 'GYUR ZHE NA,
"Suppose there exists no self;
The relation then between karma
And consequences is wrong.
If they disappeared after they did
Some deed, then whose karma
Would it be?" they object.

DANG PO NI, GAL TE BCINGS GROL KUN GYI GZHIR GYUR PA'I BDAG NI YOD PA MIN PAR DNGOS PO THAMS CAD SKAD CIG GIS SKYE 'GAG BYED PA YIN NA, DGE MI DGE'I LAS DANG DE'I 'BRAS BU'I 'BREL PA RIGS PA MIN TE DGE MI DGE'I LAS BYAS NAS NI SKAD CIG GNYIS PAR ZHIG PAS NA PHYIS LAS DE BYED PA PO SU'I LAS SU 'GYUR TE 'BRAS BU MYONG DUS NA LAS BYED PA PO MED PA'I PHYIR, KHO BO CAG LTAR NA SKYES BU RTAG PA YOD PA YIN NO ZHE NA,
Here is the first. Someone may make the following objection:
Suppose that there exists no self which is the basis of all things, whether
they are part of the condition of bondage or part of the condition of
liberation. If it is true that each and every thing that does something
goes through a process of appearing and disappearing instant by instant,
then it is completely wrong to postulate some relationship between good
and bad karma and the corresponding consequences. This is because, if it
were true that a person disappeared in the instant after he or she had done
some good or bad deed, then later on it would be impossible to say whose
karma it would be--what person there was who had committed it. And
this is because, when it was time to experience the consequence of the
karma, there would be no person left who had committed it. This is
why, according to us, there must exist a person who is unchanging.

,BYA BA 'BRAS GZHI THA DAD DANG ,
,DE BDAG BYED PA MED PAR YANG ,
,YU BU GNYI GA LA GRUB PAS,
,'DIR BRTZAD DON MED MA YIN NAM,
The basis at commission and result
Is different; also this the self,
Who committed, is not.
Both of us accept
The fact; so isn't your argument
Something meaningless?

Here is the second. Both of us accept the fact that the basis, or the person, at the
time of the commission of a karma (meaning, in this context, at the time of the
cause) and at the time when the result is experienced is essentially different. We

both also accept that--at this time when the result is experienced--the "self," in
the sense of the person who committed the karma, is not something that exists
any longer. So isn't your argument here, at this point where we are discussing
the relationship between karma and its consequences, something which is
meaningless? Don't you also accept the fact that, at the time one is committing
the karma, the experience of the result does not yet exist, and--at that time
that one is experiencing the result--the one who committed the karma no
longer exists?

If there is any problem with this train of thought, then the same problem
applies to you. And if you say you can see that, when we have the cause (meaning
at the time of the cause or whatever) then we also have the experience of its
result, you are talking about something which is completely impossible.

"Well then," you may continue, "what is your own position in this regard?" We
can point to someone as--that is, name someone as--"the one who performs the
karma" and "the one who experiences the result" all with reference to a single
continuous stream of the parts or heaps to a person. The term "continuous
stream" here refers to a whole, the person to whom the various parts belong;
and these parts are the moments of them that exist earlier, later, and in
between, and which belong to the person. To summarize, it is entirely correct
to say that any one person has both committed a karma and experienced its
consequences; it's not the case though that cause and effect are then
simultaneous--no one could ever show that was the case.

A person's mind which is already past in time, and that which is future, cannot be
the self of the person; this is because--since one has disappeared already, and
the other is yet to begin--they cannot exist as a self. And if that state of mind
which has just begun were the self of the present time, it could never be the kind
of self which you assert exists, because it would disappear in the following
instant.

exactly the same: you use logic to try to find out whether things have any nature
of their own or not, and come to the conclusion that there is no "myself" that
you could ever correctly decide existed. The idea that such a self could exist is
disproved totally by the various reasonings used, as I will describe below, to
establish that nothing has any self-nature at all.

The following contemplations are based on the Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way
of Life (Bodhisattvacharyavatara; Byang-chub-sems-dpa'i spyod-pa la 'jug-pa) of the
Buddhist master Shantideva (circa 700 AD), and the commentary upon it by
Gyaltsab Je Darma Rinchen (1364-1432) entitled Entry Point for Children of the
Victorious Buddhas (rGyal-sras 'jug-ngogs). The relevant sections are found at
folios 33B-34A and 137B-140B, respectively, in the ACIP electronic editions
TD3871 and S5436.
The content of the contemplations is translated directly from the root text and
commentary; the names of the contemplations are not a part of the original
text, but are based on the divisions of Gyaltsab Je's commentary and have been
supplied for reference. Each lesson is accompanied by the full detailed outline
for the section from Gyaltsab Je's commentary.

Consequences and No-Self

,GAL TE SEMS CAN YOD MIN NA,
,SU LA SNYING RJE BYA ZHE NA,
,'BRAS BU'I DON DU KHAS BLANGS PA'I,
,RMONGS PAS BRTAGS PA GANG YIN PA'O,
One might ask, "If there's no
Such thing as a living being, then
Who do we have compassion for?"

It is those projected by dark
Ignorance, those asserted
For attaining the goal.

GNYIS PA NI, GAL TE SEMS CAN RANG BZHIN GYIS GRUB PA 'GA' YANG YOD PA MIN NA SU LA SNYING RJE BSGOM PAR BYA STE SNYING RJE'I DMIGS YUL MED PA'I PHYIR RO ZHE NA,
Here is the second point, [disproving the idea that it would be incorrect to
meditate upon compassion]. One might begin by asking the following question:
If there is no such thing as a living being who has any nature of their own,
then who are we supposed to think of when we meditate upon compassion?
The compassion would have no object upon which to focus.

SEMS CAN RANG BZHIN GYIS GRUB PA MED NA SNYING RJE'I DMIGS YUL MI 'THAD PA'I SKYON MED PAR THAL, 'BRAS BU THAR PA THOB PA'I DON DU KHAS BLANGS PA'I RMONGS PAS BTAGS PA GANG YIN PA'I SEMS CAN THA SNYAD DU YOD PA DE SNYING RJE'I DMIGS YUL DU 'THAD PA'I PHYIR, RMONGS PAS BTAGS PA GANG ZAG DANG CHOS KYI BDAG 'DZIN LA BYAS NA DES SEMS CAN BDEN PAR BTAGS PA YIN PAS DES BTAGS PA LTAR DU GRUB PA BKAG PAS SEMS CAN MI KHEGS TE DE BKAG PAS SEMS CAN BTAGS YOD MING RKYANG DU GRUB PA'I PHYIR RO,
But there is no such problem: it's not true that compassion would have no
object to focus upon if there were no living being who had any nature of their
own. This is because it is completely proper, for the purposes of attaining the
goal of freedom, to assert the existence of those living beings who exist
nominally--that is, living beings who are projected by dark ignorance.
Suppose now that we interpret the words "projected by dark ignorance" as
referring to the tendencies to believe that the person and that things have some
self-nature. These tendencies project onto living beings a quality of true
existence; we deny that they actually exist in the way that they are projected
to be, and so we are not denying the idea of a living being itself. Thus too it
is that we can establish the existence of a living being, one which is only a
projection, one which exists only in name.

,YANG NA RMONGS PA MA RIG PA TZAM LA BYAS NAS DES BTAGS PAR GYUR PA'I SEMS CAN SNYING 
RJE'I DMIGS YUL DU YOD CES PA'O,
The phrase "projected by dark ignorance" can also be read as referring to
ignorance alone, in which case the words are saying, "It is living beings
projected by this state of mind which are the object upon which compassion
focuses."

,SEMS CAN MED 'BRAS SU YI YIN,

One may continue with the following question:
If there is no such thing as a living being, then what person is it who could
ever consider enlightenment--that is, the result of meditating upon
compassion--to be something you could ever achieve? The meditation
then would become something pointless.
It's true that this cause and effect have no true existence; but there's no
contradiction when we say that one may still meditate upon compassion, and
anything of the like, in a nominal way, in a way where one is unaware of the
real nature of things.

,DE LAS KYANG BZLOG MED CE NA,
,BDAG MED BSGOM PA MCHOG YIN NO,
That egotism which is the
Cause of pain then feeds it,
For it's ignorant about the self.
Suppose you object, "That doesn't
Mean you could stop it"; meditation
On lack of a self is supreme.

One may ask the following question: "Why is it that you said, before, that both
dark ignorance and the object it thinks it sees can be stopped?" There was a
section earlier on in the text where we spoke of "that which is the cause of all
pain." As we did there, we are here speaking of that "egotism"--meaning the
state of ignorance involved with mental affliction--which is the cause of all the
pain of this suffering existence. This state of mind is in a condition of dark
ignorance about the nature of the self, and this is what allows it to feed our pain
in the cycle of suffering. This is the reason why we must stop it, and also the
reason why it is no contradiction to say that we can stop it.

,KHO NA RE DE 'DRA BA'I RMONGS PA LDOG PA DE LAS KYANG BDEN 'DZIN LDOG PA MED PA STE, LDOG MI NUS LA LAN CIG LDOG KYANG 'KHOR BA'I PHUNG PO LTAR SLAR YANG 'BYUNG BAS GTAN ZAD DU 
'GYUR BA MED DO ZHE NA,
Suppose you make the following objection:
Even if you could stop this kind of dark ignorance, that doesn't mean that
you could stop the tendency to see things as existing truly. In fact you
couldn't; and even if you did stop it once, it would never be ended
forever: the tendency would come back again, the way that the heaps of
a person come back in this suffering cycle.

And yet it's not true that you cannot put an end to the tendency of seeing
things as existing truly. Remember that this tendency is a misperception of the
true nature of things. As such it is weak, and inferior; whereas meditating upon
the lack of a self-nature to things is, by comparison, supreme. Since this
meditation is a completely unmistaken realization into the true suchness of all
things, it has the power to rip the other perception out from the very roots.

Here is the second major division of the discussion: a detailed presentation of
the types of reasoning used to prove that things [meaning here the parts of a
person, as opposed to the person themselves,] have no self-nature. We proceed
in three steps: an explanation of the fact that things have no self-nature,
utilizing the four different forms of deep awareness; disproving any contention
that the two truths would be incorrect; and setting forth logical proofs to
demonstrate that there is no self-nature.

DANG PO LA BZHI, LUS DRAN PA NYE BAR GZHAG PA BSGOM PA DANG , TSOR BA DRAN PA NYE BAR GZHAG PA DANG , SEMS DRAN PA NYE BAR GZHAG PA DANG , CHOS DRAN PA NYE BAR GZHAG PA BSGOM PA'O,
The first of these has four parts of its own: meditating on deep awareness of
one's body; meditating on deep awareness of one's feelings; meditating on deep
awareness of one's mind; and meditating on deep awareness of objects.

The first of these as well has four sections: establishing the fact that the body
as a whole has no nature; establishing the fact that its parts, its components,
have no nature; why it is therefore completely wrong to feel attachment for the
body, something which has no nature, and which is like a dream; and how this
also proves that the person has no nature either.

Here is the first. It is not the case that the body has any nature of its own.
This is because, if it did, then when we looked for the thing we refer to as "the
body" we would have to find it to be one of the following: either the individual
components of the body, or the sum total of these parts, or something
essentially different from these. And yet we cannot find it to be any of these.

One might make the following objection:
We would rather concede that the sum total of all its components is the
body. What problem could you ever have about this?
The body is a concept formed upon the basis of the collection of the parts; as
such, it would be incorrect to say that this collection of the parts of the body
were the body itself. If you say otherwise, then ultimately you would have to
accept the idea of an ultimate in the form of atoms that were partless.

Suppose then that we seek the thing it is that we refer to with the word
"body," looking for something which exists from its own side. Neither the foot
nor the calf of a person is the body of the person, nor is the thigh or the waist.
Neither as well is the front or the back of the body the body, for "body" is a
concept applied to these things. The chest and the shoulders are not the body, nor
are the ribcage or the arms. The side under the arm is not the body, and the

shoulder above the arm is not the body. Nor are the inner organs the person's
body. Nor finally is the head or the neck this person's body. Where then in any
of these components would the body ever be? It is none of them. Neither is it
the sum of these parts, nor is it something which is essentially separate from
them. And so therefore the body is nothing that has any nature of its own.

So how could it ever be?

The joints into parts, and then

And then divide these into

Here is the second point, [establishing the fact that the body's parts, the
components, have no nature]. Think of the way in which the body of a person
is just a concept applied to the collection of its components. The hand too then

is just the same: a concept applied to the collection of its various pieces, to its
fingers. So how then could it ever be something that had some nature of its own?
It would be a complete impossibility.

Each finger, in turn, is a concept applied to the collection of the joints that make
it up--and so they too have no nature of their own. And if you examine each
of the joints as well, if you divide the joints each into their various parts, you find
they have no nature of their own either. And then you can take each of the
parts of these wholes and divide them all the way down to their atoms, and find
that none of them has any nature of its own.

And even these atoms can be divided then into their own parts: into their eastern
side, and so on. They too then are a concept applied to the collection of the
multiple sides that face in the different directions, and so they have no nature of
their own either. You can even divide the directions themselves, which have
no nature of their own either. Things then are devoid of any parts that have any
nature of their own; and so they are just like, for example, empty space.

And thus it is that atoms themselves have no nature of their own; for if they
did, then we would be forced to accept the existence of atoms that were
partless. This concept though is disproved by the logic expressed in the lines
that begin with "Suppose the six [sides in the six directions] were stuck
together."

Part VII
The following contemplations are based on the Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way
of Life (Bodhisattvacharyavatara; Byang-chub-sems-dpa'i spyod-pa la 'jug-pa) of the
Buddhist master Shantideva (circa 700 AD), and the commentary upon it by
Gyaltsab Je Darma Rinchen (1364-1432) entitled Entry Point for Children of the
Victorious Buddhas (rGyal-sras 'jug-ngogs). The relevant sections are found at
folios 34A-34B and 140B-143B, respectively, in the ACIP electronic editions
TD3871 and S5436.
The content of the contemplations is translated directly from the root text and
commentary; the names of the contemplations are not a part of the original
text, but are based on the divisions of Gyaltsab Je's commentary and have been
supplied for reference. Each lesson is accompanied by the full detailed outline
for the section from Gyaltsab Je's commentary.

The Emptiness of Feelings

The second section, meditating on deep awareness of one's feelings, covers four
different points: refuting the idea that the very essence of feeling could be
something that existed by nature; refuting the idea that the cause of feeling

could exist by nature; refuting the idea that the object upon which feeling
focuses could exist by nature; and refuting the idea that the subject state of
mind in an act of feeling could exist by nature.

The first of these points includes four sections of its own: the fact that feelings
of suffering could never exist by nature; the fact that feelings of pleasure could
never exist by nature; and advice that one should, therefore, maintain the
practice in which one meditates upon the fact that feeling has no nature.

,SDUG BSNGAL DE NYID DU YOD NA,
,CI STE RAB DGA' LA MI GNOD,
,BDE NA MYA NGAN GDUNG SOGS LA,
,ZHIM SOGS CI STE DGA' MI BYED,
Suppose that pain existed
In and of itself;
Why wouldn't it inhibit joy?
Suppose pleasure did; why then wouldn't
Something like the delicious give joy
To those stricken by grief or the like?

Here is the first. Now we will show how feelings, in the same way as the
body, are devoid of any nature of their own. Suppose that the object to be

experienced (that is, some kind of pain) and the object which experiences it (the
capacity of feeling) existed in and of themselves. Consider now the feeling of
pain, a pain which has some nature of its own, and which accompanies a
single example of the awareness of the mind. Wouldn't it be true that this
feeling could never change? And then what reason could you ever give that
it wouldn't inhibit any feeling of joy, or pleasure? Of course it would do so,
and one would never again have a feeling of pleasure. But we can see with
our own eyes that these feelings do come again, and so we would have to say
that the former feeling of pain is not something that has any nature of its own.
 GNYIS PA NI, BDE BA YANG RANG BZHIN GYIS YOD NA BU SHI BA SOGS KYI MYA NGAN GYIS GDUNG BA SOGS LA KHA ZAS ZHIM PO SOGS ZOS PAS DE'I YID CI STE DGA' MI BYED DE BDE BAR BYED PAR THAL, BZA' BTUNG ZHIM PO SOGS KYIS BDE BA RANG BZHIN GYIS GRUB PA BSKYED PA'I PHYIR,
Here is the second. Suppose on the other hand that pleasure itself did have some
nature of its own. Consider then a person whose son had died, or someone
similar: someone stricken by feelings of grief or the like. If your position were
true, then why wouldn't it fill their heart with joy, why wouldn't it give them
pleasure, when they had something like a delicious meal? It would have to do
so, since delicious food or drink would give one a feeling of pleasure that had
its own nature.

,STOBS DANG LDAN PAS ZIL MNAN PHYIR,

,GANG ZHIG NYAMS MYONG BDAG NYID MIN,
,DE NI TSOR BA JI LTAR YIN,
"Because it was overcome by the strength,
Then in this case it would not
Be something experienced."
How could anything that wasn't
Something you had an experience of
Ever be a feeling?

One might raise the following objection:
It is true that these things would give one pleasure even while you were
being tormented by grief. The pleasure though would be overcome by the
strength of the pain, and in this case the pleasure would not be something
that was experienced.
But how could anything that was not something that you had an experience of ever
be a feeling of pleasure? The fact is that it never would be, because it was never
felt. [We read here a ma before the myong in the Tibetan, as also suggested by
Khen Rinpoche.] You can apply this same response to a case where some
strong feeling of pleasure was said to overcome a feeling of pain that had its
own nature.

,SDUG BSNGAL PHRA MO NYID DU YOD,
,'DI YI RAGS PA BSAL MIN NAM,
,DE NI DE LAS GZHAN DGA' TZAM,
,ZHE NA PHRA NYID DE YANG DE'I,
And if you say, "The pain
Is something extremely subtle;
Isn't the gross what's removed?
It's something which is different,
Nothing but a happiness."
But the subtle is still the same.

,GAL TE BDE BA STOBS LDAN SKYES PA'I TSE TSOR BA SDUG BSNGAL PHRA MO NYID DU YOD PA MYONG BAS CUNG ZAD KYANG MA MYONG BA MA YIN NO ZHE NA, TSOR BA SDUG BSNGAL PHRA MO YOD NA BDE BA STOBS LDAN 'DIS SDUG BSNGAL LA GNOD PA CI ZHIG BYAS NAS BDE BA STOBS LDAN MYONG BAR 
And what if you say now the following:
When someone has a strong feeling of pleasure, they experience a kind
of pain which is something extremely subtle--so it's not the case that you
fail to experience even the slightest form of pain.
If one were experiencing some subtle form of pain, then how could it ever be
the case that the strong feeling of pleasure inhibited it? How could you ever
establish that the strong feeling of pleasure was even being felt?

Someone may reply with the following:
Isn't it the case that the strong feeling of pleasure removes a gross form of
the pain? This is what we would say. The subtle form of the pain is
something which is completely different from the great feeling of
pleasure--it is, in a sense, nothing but a more subtle form of happiness.
But even if something is no more than a subtle form of pleasure we could still
never escape the fact that it would have to possess the defining characteristics
of pleasure. As such, anything which is a subtle form of pleasure must still be
this same pleasure.

,GAL TE 'GAL RKYEN SKYES PAS NA,
,SDUG BSNGAL SKYES PA MIN NA NI,
,TSOR BAR RTOG PA MNGON ZHEN NYID,
,YIN ZHES BYA BAR GRUB MIN NAM,
Suppose you claim, "This creates
An incompatible condition, and so
You have no feeling of pain."
Isn't it though true
That we can say that you
Simply believe in conceptions?

,BDE NA MYA NGAN GDUNG SOGS LA ZHES PA'I SKYON SPONG BAR 'DOD NAS GAL TE BZA' BTUNG ZHIM PA SOGS LAS BDE BA SKYES PA'I TSE SDUG BSNGAL DANG 'GAL BA BDE BA'I RKYEN SKYES PAS NA DE'I TSE SDUG BSNGAL SKYES PA MIN NO ZHE NA, BDE SDUG GI TSOR BA RTOG PAS MNGON PAR ZHEN CING BTAGS PA TZAM NYID YIN ZHES BYA BAR GRUB PA MIN NAM STE GRUB PAR THAL, BZA' BTUNG GCIG NYID RTOG PA'I DBANG GIS BDE SDUG GNYIS KA'I RGYUR BTAGS PA'I PHYIR,
Suppose that yet another person, hoping to avoid the problems raised in the
verse that talks about "Suppose pleasure did...to those stricken by grief or the
like," makes this claim:
Consider the point at which something like delicious food or drink gives
you a feeling of pleasure. This creates a condition for pleasure which is
incompatible with the pain, and so, at this particular point, you have no
feeling of pain.
Isn't it though true that we can say that feelings of pleasure and pain are simply
conceptions in whose existence you believe? That they are mere projections? It
is true, because one and the same food or drink can be projected onto as being
a cause of two different things: pleasure, and pain.

,DE NYID PHYIR NA 'DI YI NI,
,GNYEN PO RNAM DPYOD 'DI BSGOM STE,
,RNAM BRTAGS ZHING LAS BYUNG BA YI,
,BSAM GTAN RNAL 'BYOR PA YI ZAS,
Thus it is that one should
Meditate upon this analysis
As an antidote for that.
The deep meditation that grows from
The fertile field of careful examination
Is food for the serious practitioner.

GSUM PA NI, TSOR BA RANG BZHIN GYIS MA GRUB PA DE NYID KYI PHYIR NA TSOR BA BDEN 'DZIN 'DI YI GNYEN POR TSOR BA RANG BZHIN MED PAR RTOGS PA'I RNAM PAR DPYOD PA 'DI BSGOM PAR BYA

Here is the third section. Feelings are not something which have any nature
of their own; and thus it is that one should meditate upon this analysis wherein--as
an antidote for that tendency to see feelings as having some true existence of
their own--you come to realize that they actually have no such nature.
This is because the special vision of emptiness, focused as it is upon the way
things really are, grows from the fertile field of this careful examination and
analysis. And the "body," in the sense of the realizations, of a serious
practitioner grows ever stronger and farther by becoming completely
accustomed to the deep meditation wherein one practices this special vision
based upon meditative quietude. And this is why that deep meditation can be
called a kind of "food," for it is just like the ordinary food that makes the body
grow further.
This state of single-pointed concentration, incidentally, also helps the ordinary
body grow more and more. For all these reasons, we must make great efforts
to reach that deep, balanced state of meditation where we remain one-
pointedly in the realization of emptiness.

Contemplation Thirty
The Emptiness of the Mind

,YID NI DBANG RNAMS LA MI GNAS,
,GZUGS SOGS LA MIN BAR NA'ANG MIN,
The mind doesn't reside in the faculties,
Nor in the visual or the rest,
Nor somewhere in between.

,GSUM PA SEMS DRAN PA NYER BZHAG BSGOM PA LA GNYIS, YID KYI SHES PA RANG BZHIN GYIS MED PAR BSTAN PA DANG , RNAM SHES LNGA RANG BZHIN GYIS MED PAR BSTAN PA'O,
Here is the third section, which is meditating on deep awareness of one's mind.
We proceed in two steps: demonstrating the fact that consciousness of the
mind cannot exist by nature; and demonstrating the fact that the other five
kinds of consciousness cannot exist by nature.

DANG PO NI, YID NI RANG BZHIN GYIS GRUB PA MED DE DBANG PO DRUG PO RNAMS LA YANG RANG BZHIN GYIS MI GNAS, GZUGS SOGS YUL DRUG LA RANG BZHIN GYIS GNAS PA MIN LA DE DAG GI BAR NA'ANG STE DE GNYIS TSOGS PA LA'ANG GNAS PA MIN TE DBU MA LA 'JUG PA LAS GSUNGS PA LTAR GYI SHING RTA'I DPYAD PA BDUN DRAN PAR BYA'O,
Here is the first. The mind is not something which has any nature of its own,
and this is because of the following reasons:
(1) It does not reside, through any nature of its own, within the six faculties;
(2) It is not something which resides, through any nature of its own, within
the six objects of visual matter or the rest; and
(3) It is not something which resides "somewhere in between" these
two--meaning in the combination of the two.

For this point one should recall the seven points in the analysis of a wagon, as
found in Entering the Middle Way. [These are examining a wagon to see
whether it is self-existently:
(1) its parts (in which case it would have to be as many as its parts);
(2) something unrelated to its parts (in which case it would be some
externally existing "self," and no longer be a changing thing);
(3) something that depends upon its parts (in which case their relationship
would have to be that of two completely separate things, like a bowl and
the yogurt in the bowl--since the thing dependent was a self-existent
other);
(4) something that its parts depend upon (similar problem);
(5) something that possesses its parts (again, something completely other
than its parts, if it "possesses" them);
(6) the sum of its parts (independent of our projections, which cannot be);
or
(7) some special visual outline of the wagon (if this were true, then the
mental heaps, since they are not physical matter and cannot have shape
or color, could not be included in the "person" or his "mind").]

The inside is not the mind,
Nor the outside, and neither
Can it be found somewhere else.
There exists none that's neither the body
Nor other; neither mixed nor an isolated,
Independent thing.

Because it lacks even the
Slightest bit, the one with the
Mind is natural nirvana.

Consider the so-called "inner agent," the "inner person" that the non-Buddhist
schools say exists. The mind cannot, through some nature of its own, reside in
this sense "inside," nor can it reside somewhere outside--in the hand or the like.
Neither can it be found, through some nature of its own, to be somewhere else
than the inside or the outside.
Think of a mind that had some nature of its own: one that was neither the body
nor truly something other than the body: think of a mind that was neither mixed
with the body nor an independent thing, isolated from the body. No such thing
exists. And because it lacks even the slightest bit of any natural way of being, the
mind is completely empty of any nature of its own: and this itself is what we
refer to as the "natural state of nirvana."

The third part, setting forth logical proofs to demonstrate that there is no self-

refuting that neither a thing which does, nor does not, exist could ever grow.

grow without a cause; refuting the idea that things could grow from something
other than themselves which was also unchanging; refuting the idea that things
could grow from a primal One which was unchanging; a summary of the
refutation of the idea that things could grow without a cause; and a refutation
of the idea that things could grow from both themselves and things other than
themselves.

Most often we can see,
With that which is shared throughout
The world, all the causes.
The great variety, things like the
Stem of a lotus, are caused
By a variety of causes.
If you ask what causes the variety
Of causes--they come from none other
Than a previous variety of causes.

Here is the first. The non-Buddhist school known as "Those who Reject the
World," and other such groups as well, note the fact that there are things--like
the patterns on a peacock--which don't seem as if anyone at all has made
them; they say:
Consider the roughness of a lotus petal, and its texture or other such
qualities; think as well of the sharpness of a thorn, or the like. They just
happen by their own nature; it's not as if someone made them that way.
Your idea though is incorrect. This is because we can most often see--even with
that direct perception which is shared throughout the world--all the causes that
create the vast majority of inner and outer working things, such as crops and
the like. And the great variety of results--that is, things like the colors of the
stem of a lotus, or the number of petals it has--are all caused by a great variety
of different causes. If you ask what it is then that causes all the different varieties
of causes themselves; the answer is that they come from none other than a previous
set of a great variety of causes.

,CI PHYIR RGYU YIS 'BRAS SKYED NUS,

SKYE BAR DMIGS PA'I PHYIR RO,
One may ask the following question:
Just how is it that a variety of causes can create a variety of results?
There's no problem though with the idea: it's not as though they have no such
power. It is precisely due to the power of the causes that came before them that a
variety of causes is able to create a variety of individual results. This allows
us then to state the following proof:
(1) Consider all these working things.
(2) It is not the case that they have no causes, because
(3) We can observe that they grow intermittently, in time and space.
[Please note that the mi 'dra na of the Tibetan should almost surely be read as
mi 'dra ba, although both editions of the text available to us repeat this spelling.
The meaning remains the same in either case.]

What Emptiness is Empty Of

One may make the following objection:
For this very reason, it is wrong to say that the meditation upon emptiness
which you propose is perfectly correct; the valid perception which
perceives it is, after all, "deceptive."
We answer with a logical proof--
(1) Consider the entire body of existing phenomena.
(2) It is absolutely correct for us to assert both that the valid perception
which perceives emptiness is itself deceptive, and that the emptiness
which it establishes as existing is also deceptive, because
(3) When you understand, through the process of conceptualization,
the refutation wherein we deny the existence of a working thing
which exists in truth, you rely upon forming a mental image of the
object whose existence we deny.

One would never be able to

For this reason, the fact that the
Deceptive thing is not a thing
Is something clearly deceptive.

And this really is the case, because one would never be able to grasp, through the
process of conceptualization, how something was devoid of being a thing (how it
lacked any true existence) unless one was first able to "encounter" (or
conceptualize) that thing it was which one "imagined it to be" (meaning true
existence); that is, unless one was first able to form a mental picture of what
it was like to exist in truth. And for this reason--which means, because of the
fact that the "deceptive thing" or object we deny is totally impossible--then the
condition that remains when we have denied the existence of this object
(meaning the fact that this object is not a thing) is itself something which is
clearly deceptive.

,SNGA MA'I DPE NI RTOG PA LA MO SHAM BU'I RNAM PA MA SHAR BAR MO SHAM BU SHI BA'I RNAM PA MI 'CHAR BA BZHIN NO,
Here is an example to illustrate what we have just been talking about. Until
such time as you are able to form a mental picture of the child of a barren
woman, you can never form a picture of this same child dying.

Consider the condition that remains after you have disproved the object that
we deny: that is, the fact that there is no true existence. If this itself existed
truly, then the image of the emptiness of true existence which presents itself
to the mind working in a logical mode would itself have to exist in truth. It's
moreover the case (1) that it is impossible for a collection of parts to be there
when any one of its parts has been disproved; and (2) that, since the object we
deny appears to exist in truth, this appearance of true existence would itself
have to exist truly. And if this were all true, then true existence itself would
have to be something that existed. But since it doesn't exist, then the voidness
of true existence which remains after it has been disproved is itself something
which is deceptive, rather than being something which exists in truth. This is
the point being made in lines from Root Wisdom like the one which says, "If
there were the least thing that were not empty, then..."
[The full popularized form of the lines being referred to by Gyaltsab Je reads:
If there were the least thing that were not empty,
Then how could emptiness itself exist?
The point is that, if emptiness itself were not empty, then nothing else could
be either.]

,DES NA RMI LAM BU SHI LA,
,DE MED SNYAM PA'I RNAM RTOG NI,
,DE YOD RNAM PAR RTOG PA YI,
,GEGS YIN DE YANG BRDZUN PA YIN,
Therefore when a child dies
In a dream, the state of mind which
Imagines that he's gone blocks out
The state of mind imagining that
He is still there, despite the fact
That it's all deceptive.

Unless one is able to form a mental image of what it would be like for
something to exist in truth, one can never understand the emptiness of this
true existence well. Therefore those who hope to understand emptiness must
become masters of the art of defining for themselves just what the object we
deny is.
Therefore, for this reason, think of the example of a dream in which you see your
child die. The state of mind where you imagine that the child is gone blocks out the
state of mind where you imagine that the child is still there, despite the fact that the
state of mind being eliminated and the state of mind that works against it are
both just deceptive, just a dream.
Here our case is the same. It is absolutely no contradiction to say that a
corrective state of mind which is deceptive can destroy an undesirable state of
mind which is also deceptive, or that a valid perception which is deceptive can
perceive an object which is also deceptive.
Those of the non-Buddhist school called the "Numerists," on the other hand,
assert that all knowable objects exist in truth; and so they don't understand
how to establish the existence of a valid perception which is deceptive. The
problems you have raised therefore don't apply equally to us.

Contemplation Thirty-Three
Things are Empty Because They are Dependent

An illusion, and that object which
Dark ignorance imagines true?

Here secondly is the proof which uses dependent origination. Consider now
that object which ignorance, the dark ignorance which relates to mental affliction,
imagines has some true existence; consider a working thing that exists
nominally. What difference is there between this thing and an illusion, or a dream,
or a reflection in a mirror, or anything of the like? This is because, despite the
fact they are empty of any nature of their own, they still appear to have such
a nature.

Consider next something like an illusory horse or an elephant, or anything of
the sort, created by a magician. And think too of the working things that are
created by causes and conditions. Suppose that these things had some nature of
their own. When they started then they would have to be something that comes
from somewhere else, and when they stopped they would have to go to
somewhere else.
Try to examine though where it is that they came from, and where it is they are
going. The coming and going have no nature of their own, and so we can state
the following proof:
Consider the person and the heaps that are his parts.
They have no nature of their own, because
They are examples of dependent origination.
They are, for example, like a reflection in a mirror.

Consider "factors" [referring to immature karma, the second of the twelve links
in the chain of dependent origination], and various results such as sprouts or
the like--things which we see grow because of their proximity to certain causes;
that is, ignorance [referring to the first link] and seeds. These things are
artificial: they cannot grow without their causes, and thus they are just the same
as a reflection in a mirror. [That is, they look like the real thing, but they are
not.] How then could we ever say that they have any true existence? They never
would.

The four lines [in Tibetan, six in the English] of the root text which speak of
a magician function to express the truth of the "element of necessity" in the
proof of emptiness using the principle of dependent origination. [This is one
part of a syllogism in Buddhist logic; in this case, it would be expressed as, "If
something is an example of dependent origination, it cannot exist in truth."]
The next two and a half lines [in the Tibetan, four and a half in the English]
express the "element of the reason." [Which in this case would be "they are
examples of dependent origination."]

The following half of a line [in the Tibetan, two halves in the English]
expresses the "element of a concordant example." [Meaning, here, something
other than the object under discussion which is--like this object itself--both
something which does not exist in truth and which is an example of dependent
origination.]
The final line [in the Tibetan, one and a half in the English] then expresses the
assertion. [That is, "All inner and outer working things lack any true
existence."]

The following contemplations are based on the Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way
of Life (Bodhisattvacharyavatara; Byang-chub-sems-dpa'i spyod-pa la 'jug-pa) of the
Buddhist master Shantideva (circa 700 AD), and the commentary upon it by
Gyaltsab Je Darma Rinchen (1364-1432) entitled Entry Point for Children of the
Victorious Buddhas (rGyal-sras 'jug-ngogs). The relevant sections are found at
folios 36B-36B and 151B-153A, respectively, in the ACIP electronic editions
TD3871 and S5436.
The content of the contemplations is translated directly from the root text and
commentary; the names of the contemplations are not a part of the original
text, but are based on the divisions of Gyaltsab Je's commentary and have been
supplied for reference. Each lesson is accompanied by the full detailed outline
for the section from Gyaltsab Je's commentary.

Contemplation Thirty-Four
The Emptiness of Becoming and Ending

Here is the third section, the proof based on refuting that neither a thing which
does nor does not exist could ever grow. This section itself has three steps:
making the proof, and thus refuting the idea that the arising of things could
exist by nature; using this same proof to disprove that the ending of things
could exist by nature; and showing how this proves that suffering existence
and the state of peace have one quality which is totally equivalent.

,DNGOS PO YOD PAR GYUR PA LA,

Suppose that working things
Did have some; what need
Would there be for causes?
And even if these didn't
Exist, what need again
Would there be for causes?

Here is the first. Suppose that working things had some nature of their own.
What need then would there be for causes? They wouldn't have to make anything
grow. And even if these results didn't exist, then what need again would there be
for causes? They would never be able to make anything grow either.
Incidentally, the fact is that no result at all ever exists at the time that its cause
is present, and this is invariably the way that things grow; so this is not what
we are denying in the present case. Rather, we are denying that something
that could never exist at all could grow.

And suppose next that we are denying that a result which did exist could
grow. What we deny in this case is the kind of result that the Numerists
posit--one that could exist at the time of its cause; as well as the result which
the majority of schools accept, which is one that could have any nature of its
own. To say though that "Because something has already grown, it is not
necessary for the cause to make it grow," would be beyond all logic. The point
then is that we are asserting that cause and effect are empty of any nature of
their own; that they are like an illusion, or the reflection of an image in the
mirror.

You could have billions of causes,
But still never turn
A thing that didn't function.
How can the condition become
A functioning thing? To become so
It could be no other one.

What follows next is a proof that a thing without any function could never be
the object of the functioning of a cause. In this regard, someone might make
the following claim:
Since a result that already existed would already have occurred, there
would be no need for its cause to produce it. Why though is it that you
say a result which does not exist cannot occur?
The fact though is that you could have literally billions of causes involved, but you
could still never turn something that was not a functioning thing into something

that was: there is nothing at all that could ever make something that was not
a functioning thing into something that was.

And if you say it is possible, then let us ask you a question. When this
happens, then which of the following is the case: does the thing which is not
functioning not lose its condition of being something which does not function,
or does it? If you say it does not, then how can you claim that the condition of
not functioning could become a thing that did function? After all, the condition
of being able to perform a function is something completely inconsistent with
the condition of being unable to perform a function.

,GNYIS PA LTAR NA DNGOS PO DANG DNGOS MED LAS DNGOS POR 'GYUR RGYU GNYIS LAS GZHAN YANG GANG ZHIG YIN MI SRID PA'I PHYIR RO,
And suppose you say the latter, [that it does lose its condition, and becomes
something else;] this is impossible, because there are only two ways that
something could become a functioning thing: either from being a functioning
thing, or from being a thing which doesn't function. No other one is possible.

It's impossible for it to be
Functioning while it does not;
When could it become functioning?
Until such time as the functioning
Was produced, it could never
Lose its not functioning.

Until such time as it did lose
Not functioning, the condition
Of doing so would be impossible.

Suppose moreover that the thing which doesn't function does not lose its
condition of being a thing which doesn't function when it is the object of a
cause. It is completely impossible for anything to be a functioning thing while it
is a thing which does not function. When then do you imagine it could be that
this became a functioning thing? A functioning thing could never grow so long
as the thing was something that didn't function.

Suppose again that it became a functioning thing after it did lose its condition
of being a thing which didn't function. Until such time as the functioning thing
was produced, it could never lose its condition of being a thing which didn't
function; but until such time as it did lose the condition of not functioning, it is an
impossibility that it could take on the condition of having a function--for the two
conditions are mutually exclusive.

,DNGOS PO'ANG MED PAR 'GYUR MIN TE,

A thing that does function could never
Be what didn't either:
It would have to have two natures.

A thing that doesn't function could never become a thing that did; just so, a
thing that does function could never become a thing that didn't either. If a thing
were half something that functioned and half something that didn't function,
then a single thing would have to have two different natures, and this again is
impossible.
This same kind of reasoning can be used for disproving both the idea that
something which didn't exist at all could grow, and the idea that any of the
things which have no function could ever grow.

Consider then a sprout.
It cannot grow through any nature of its own, because
Neither can a thing which exists and which has a nature of its own ever
grow, nor can a thing which does not exist and which has a nature of its
own ever grow.
It is like, for example, the child of a barren woman.

Disproving the idea that something which does not exist at the time of its
cause could ever grow also serves to disprove the idea that something which
does not exist at the time of its cause, but which then grows into something
which has a nature of its own, could ever grow either. Learn to make the
distinction between the two ideas being refuted here.

,DE LTAR 'GAG PA YOD MIN ZHING ,

It's equally true that the ending
Has none, neither does
A functioning thing have any.

Here is the second point, [which is using this same proof to disprove that the
ending of things could exist by nature]. With the foregoing we have explained
how the arising of things could never have any nature of its own. It is equally
true that the ending of things is not something which has any nature of its own.
Neither is any functioning thing anything which has any nature of its own. And
for this reason we can say that all of the events of the world are things that have
never either begun or ended through any nature of their own; they are nothing but
peace--that is, what we call "nirvana by nature."

,'GRO BA RMI LAM LTA BU STE,

They are just like cane.

Here is the third point, [which is showing how all this proves that our
suffering existence and the state of peace have one quality which is totally
equivalent]. The events of this suffering life are like a dream; this is because they
lack the slightest bit of any nature of their own, and yet still exhibit all the
workings of actions and the objects of actions, without any confusion of the
two. If you analyze these events with the logic that examines suchness, then you
find that they are just like a hollow piece of cane: although they appear to have
some substantial existence, they lack even the tiniest bit of any essence, any
nature of their own.

Here is the milepost for checking whether or not what you are doing qualifies
as an examination into suchness. Suppose you decide not to be satisfied just
with an object which is no more than something created by concepts,
something that exists only nominally. If you resolve then to go and seek the
thing which your concept or term applies to, then what you are doing qualifies
as an examination into suchness. And suppose that you proceed in the other
way--that is, suppose you decide to simply remain satisfied with the fact that
something is no more than a creation of terms or projections. If you then
proceed to examine how it is that John goes, or stays, or anything of the like,
then you are performing what we would call an analysis into terms or
projections.

Consider now the condition of reaching nirvana, where you are freed from the
shackles of suffering life--from desire and the rest, and the condition of failing
to reach nirvana--that is, of being thrust into the prison of cyclic existence.
From the point of view of their suchness, there is no difference between these two.
This is because a suffering existence and peace itself are totally equivalent in
being empty of any nature of their own.

This same point is made in lines like the following, from the King of
Concentration:
Those who live in cyclic existence
Are similar to a dream;
No one here is ever born,
And no one ever dies.
There are also words such as those found in the Sutra Requested by the Realized
Being Upali:
For anyone who attempts to judge
The various natures of things,
There are no goals at all, and neither
Achieving any goals.

Here is the first point, [which is a description of the way things really are].
Suppose that you do, in this way (meaning in the manner described above),
consider all these working things, empty as they are of any nature of their own.
And you judge them to see if they have any nature that comes from their own
side. How then could there be any gain that you would feel attracted to; how
could you ever obtain anything? And how too could there ever be any loss
that would make you feel angry; how could you ever lose anything? Neither
one exists in the slightest.

Do you any honor then,
Or any insult either?

Who feels the craving,
And what is it they crave for?

How could anyone ever do you any honor then, or any insult either? How could
they ever help you, or hurt you? What would there be to strive to get? What
would there be to work to get rid of? Where would pleasure or pain ever come
from? What could ever cause them? How could there ever be the things you
don't want, or the things you do want? How could there ever be anything with
its own nature that made you happy, or made you unhappy?
Use the logic where you examine the true nature of things. If you look at it from
this point of view, you see that none of the three elements in a situation has any
nature of its own: When you crave something, where is the fact of craving?
And who is it that is feeling the craving? And what is it that they feel the craving
for?

You should in this same way analyze karma, the person collecting the karma,
and so on. When you look at all these beings, all those who are alive in the
world, who is it then that dies here in this suffering existence? Death itself is
nothing that has any nature of its own.
Who is it that is going to come and take the future life? Who is it that went and
took the last life? Who is the relative that is helping you so much? Who is the
friend you feel so attracted to? None of them has the least nature of their own.
You must thus come to comprehend the real nature of things, and make great
efforts to neutralize the eight worldly thoughts within you.
[The eight worldly thoughts consist of having the following emotions, based on
a misperception of reality:
1) Being happy when we acquire some thing,
2) And unhappy when we don't.
3) Being happy when we feel good,
4) And unhappy when we don't.
5) Being happy when we become well known,
6) And unhappy when we don't.
7) Being happy when someone speaks well of us,
8) And unhappy when someone speaks ill of us.]

The following contemplations are based on the Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way
of Life (Bodhisattvacharyavatara; Byang-chub-sems-dpa'i spyod-pa la 'jug-pa) of the
Buddhist master Shantideva (circa 700 AD), and the commentary upon it by
Gyaltsab Je Darma Rinchen (1364-1432) entitled Entry Point for Children of the
Victorious Buddhas (rGyal-sras 'jug-ngogs). The relevant sections are found at
folios 37A-40A and 155A-163A, respectively, in the ACIP electronic editions
TD3871 and S5436.
The content of the contemplations is translated directly from the root text and
commentary; the names of the contemplations are not a part of the original
text, but are based on the divisions of Gyaltsab Je's commentary and have been

The Final End
(The following is the last contemplation in the "Chapter on Wisdom")

,DE LTAR SDUG BSNGAL MES GDUNGS LA,

When is it then I'll be able
To put an end to suffering
With a rain of every goodness,

Of all that's kept me well,
From clouds of my good deeds to those
Who are caught in the fire of suffering?

Here is the third point, [which is a description of the way in which great
compassion thinks of its object]. Consider then how, in the way described
above, merciless suffering comes to the minds of all these beings; think well
upon the way of torment, the way in which they are tortured by pain.
Focusing upon those beings who are caught in the fire of this suffering, think to
yourself this way:
When is it that I will be able to help put an end to the suffering they all feel
in the lower realms? When will the clouds of my good deeds, my acts of
giving and the rest, send down upon them a great rain of every goodness:
all the things I have that keep me well in life--medicine, food, and all the
rest?
[Please note that the texts available to us seem to read here 'tsogs chas
kyis, an ancient word for "with the necessities of life," rather than the tsogs
char gyis, of the root text, meaning "with the rain of my collection of
good karma." The translation reflects both readings.]
Meditate on great compassion, by thinking this way too:
What if it were true that everyone in the lower realms could be freed
from all their pain? May they be freed! May I free them myself!

,NAM ZHIG DMIGS PA MED TSUL DU,

,STONG PA NYID NI STON PAR 'GYUR,
When is it I will, with respect,
Accumulate masses of merit
With the wisdom that has no focus?
When is it I will teach emptiness
To all those devastated
By their tendency to focus?

Here is a prayer that we become the cause for their liberation from suffering:
When is it that I will come to realize that every single object which exists
is completely devoid of any nature of its own? When will I come to have
the wisdom that has no focus [towards things as self-existent]? And when
will I, with great respect, go about the task of accumulating infinite masses
of merit, acts of giving and the rest, using this wisdom as a method to
achieve the goals?
Living beings are all devastated here in the cycle of suffering by their
tendency to focus on things and believe that they have some true existence.
When is it that I will be able to teach them the concept of emptiness, in
order to help them put a stop to all the sufferings of the cycle?

Meditate thus on great compassion, think to yourself:
What if it were true that every living being could be freed from the
sufferings of this cycle of life? May I free them myself!

For the love and compassion which is a part of the path of the greater way to
be complete in every respect, you must have the desire that you could move
every living being to the state of enlightenment itself: that you could assure
their coming to possess every kind of happiness, and avoiding every kind of
pain.

To summarize, we must undertake to meditate upon the real nature of things,
basing this analysis upon the practice of meditative quietude. The "me" you
think of when you say "it's mine" is nothing more than a projection that you
lay on the heaps or parts that make you up. It has not the slightest bit of any
natural existence, of any definitive existence, of any independent way of being.
The existence of a person is something which happens only by virtue of an
idea; the person exists only through projections, only in dependence on other
things, and nothing more. Practice thinking of things this way: see that they
have no nature of their own. Continue in your meditation, applying this same
concept to every existing object: to the parts of a person, and everything else
as well.

Here is the fourth major section, which is an explanation of how to train
oneself in the perfection of giving, where you give away your body,
possessions, and all your collected virtue; this explanation is accomplished
through presenting the part [of the seven parts for collecting virtue and
purifying negativities] known as "dedication." Here there are two steps: an
explanation of the text of the chapter, and an explanation of its name.

The first of these comes in three parts of its own: a brief presentation,
accomplished by making a dedication that every living being should be led
into the way of life of a bodhisattva; a more detailed explanation of the act of
dedication; and an act of obeisance, inspired by recalling kindness.

Here is the first. "I," meaning the author of this commentarial classic, "have
thus finished composing a very thorough guide to the way of life followed by
bodhisattvas. It expresses the entire contents of the highest of all spoken words:
it incorporates a description of the entire path for reaching Buddhahood,
including an explanation of this result itself; that is, it shows how to actually
put into practice every one of the steps of the path designed for people of three
different scopes. I hereby dedicate all the virtue that I have achieved through
this act, as well as all the virtue that anyone may ever obtain through teaching,
or learning, or thinking about the meaning of this book. Through this virtue,
may every living being engage in--that is actually practice, properly--the
bodhisattva's way of life."

The Sutra Requested by Ocean of Wisdom states,

Think of drops of water as they fall into the great salt sea;
Until the ocean itself dries up, the drops never disappear.
Virtuous acts that are dedicated in whole to enlightenment
Are the same, and never finish until Buddhahood is attained.
As we pointed out above, dedication has the further benefit that virtues which
would have produced only a minor result give forth instead effects which are
immense. And virtues that would have at some point worn out if they had not
been dedicated become never-ending, and ever-increasing. Think well on these
fine qualities of dedication; take even the very smallest good deeds that you
ever do, and make great efforts to dedicate them to reaching matchless
enlightenment for the sake of every living being.

The sutras on the perfection of wisdom are making this same point when they
say,
Your entire core of virtue should be dedicated exclusively to the state of
All Knowing alone; never engage in making dedication of them to the
levels of a Listener, or a Self-Made Buddha.

DGE BA DE YANG LE'U DGU PA NAS BSHAD PA LTAR GYI 'KHOR GSUM BDEN MED DU RTOGS PA'I SHES RAB KYI RTZIS ZIN PA'I NGANG NAS BYA LA, BSNGO BA DANG SMON LAM KHYAD PAR CHER MED MOD KYI 'DOD BYA'I 'BRAS BU DON GNYER GYI 'DUN PAS KHYAD PAR DU BYAS PA SMON LAM DANG , RGYU'I DGE BA RNAMS 'BRAS BU DE'I RGYUR 'GYUR BA'I 'DUN PAS KHYAD PAR DU BYAS PA BSNGO BA'O,
Moreover this virtue, as explained in the ninth chapter, must be performed in
such a manner that it is imbued with the wisdom which perceives the fact that
none of the three elements has any true existence. Admittedly there is no great
difference between the act of dedication and that of prayer. Nonetheless, an
act of prayer can be described as something characterized by a kind of
aspiration in which you hope for some goal, something that you wish to
happen. Dedication, on the other hand, is something characterized by a kind
of aspiration in which you hope that virtues, from their causal point of view,
might become a cause for some particular result to occur.

Here is the third point, [which is a dedication for the goal that the teachings,
which are the source of every happiness, should spread in the world]:
Consider the teachings of the Victorious Ones, the Buddhas: they are first
of all, due to the power of the amount of virtue involved, the single
medicine, and a matchless medicine, for curing every pain of living kind.
And they are as well the ultimate source of every happiness that living kind
ever experiences. I pray that they may remain, with prosperity and glory, far
into the future; that is, for as long as the cycle of suffering may last itself.

And here is the third more general point: an act of obeisance, inspired by

virtuous state of mind through which I have been able to meditate upon
the Wish for enlightenment, and to train myself in the activities of a
bodhisattva, and to compose this classical commentary which takes these
activities as its subject matter. In short, I bow down to the personal cause
of these; that is, to Gentle Voice (Manjushri) himself.

This final chapter is characterized by the act of dedication, in which virtues are
transformed by fierce feelings of aspiration expressed in prayers for temporal
and ultimate goals. As such, it represents a detailed explanation of how we
train ourselves in that type of generosity where we give away our bodies,
possessions, and the virtues we have collected, all in order to help others.
Earlier on in the text too there were occasional explanations of how to train
oneself in the perfection of giving. We can say therefore that there is no single
entire chapter which covers how to train oneself in giving.

*************
(1) Thus have I completed writing
A Guide to the Bodhisattva's
Way of Life.
And I pray that by this goodness
Every living being
May take up this way of life.
(2) By the power of this good deed too
May any single living creature
In sickness or in pain,
Of body or of mind,
In any corner of this universe,
Be thrown into a sea of bliss.

(3) And for as long as they may wander
In the circle of suffering life,
May they never lose this bliss.
May every one of them one day reach
The bliss beyond all other,
And stay there never-ending.
(4) I don't know how many
Realms of hell there are
Hidden in our world;
But by this power may every person
Trapped in one instead find joy
In the joy of the Heaven of Joy.
(5) May those who freeze in the cold of hell
Be covered in warmth.
May infinite showers of gentle rain
Fall from vast bodhisattva clouds
To cool the searing pain
Of those who live there in fire.
(6) May the forest of falling leaves of knives
Turn for those who live there into
A pleasure grove of shady bowers.
May the daggers of the trunks
Of the trees of Shalmali
Sprout as the Wish-Giving Tree instead.

(7) May the caverns of hell suddenly echo forth
With the soft sweet song of the dove and nightingale,
Ruby-throated sparrow, graceful swans, birds
Of every kind, drawn to the gentle waters
That spring up instantly there, covered with lotuses
Whose delicate fragrance fills the air.
(8) May the heaps of burning embers of fire become piles
Of precious jewels, and the red-hot glowing iron floor
The ground of a new world, sparkling in crystal light.
May the mountains that slam together, crushing the crowds
Of helpless people between them, turn to the palace
Temples of heaven, filled with bliss-filled Buddhas.
(9) In the moment that I speak may the great rain of putrid
Filth, and stones of solid fire, knives, and spears,
Transform into a soft steady shower of fragrant flower petals.
And in the hells of anger, where people snatch up rocks
And sticks to gash one another open, may they instead
Gather up armfuls of petals, laughing, tossing over each other.
(10) I send the awesome power of the good deed that I've done
As well to all those trapped within the river that cannot
Be crossed, wrapped within the hell-flame there, with all
The skin and flesh ripped away from their bodies, the bones
Jutting out in the glistening white of freshly fallen snow;
May this power grow their bodies back, in the form of divine Angels.

(11) And then may the beings in hell take pause,
and wonder suddenly to themselves,
"Why now do the henchmen
Of the Lord of Death, and his vicious
ravens, and the birds of prey,
Why do they turn and run from us?"
What glorious power has turned the night of hell
to golden day, and smothered us within
this happiness, this strength, this bliss?
Who could have such power?" And may they raise
their eyes and see the blue
of sky, and seated in it
The One Who Holds the Diamond in His Hand.
And then may joy spread
in their hearts, so powerful that
It tears away every wrong they ever did,
and so then they can rise
and fly--fly away with him.
(12) May a rain of lovely flower petals
mixed with cool and perfumed water
Descend in a song and extinguish the flames
of the fires that burn in hell.
May the beings who live there look upon
this sight, and suddenly
Be overcome by happiness. And then
may they think to themselves,
"Who could have done this thing?"
And may they turn and see
Before them the One who holds
the Lotus in His Hand.

(13) And then may the hell beings
hear a voice that
calls to them and says:
"Come my friends, so far away,
cast away your fears now,
and come be at my side;
Come to the one whose power
has stripped away your agony
and thrown you into joy."
And when they lay their eyes on this one,
on Gentle Voice himself,
may every miserable creature there
Burst forth in a song, a song
that roars throughout the hells,
a song that sings:
"You are the bodhisattva who protects
every single living being,
overcome by your love for them;
(14) "You are the youth divine,
with your flowing locks,
body blazing in light;
How could it be
that you have come to us,
and smashed the terrors here?
Are you not the one
to whom a thousand gods
would run, to touch
The tips of their crowns
at your lotus feet?
The one whose eyes glisten
In tears of compassion for us?
The one on whom
A constant shower of petals falls?
See him now--surrounded by palaces
filled with crowds of celestial maidens
singing out his praises!"

(15) Oh thus may it come to pass,
through the power of the goodness
that I've done:
Every suffering being in hell,
wrapped now deep in happiness,
standing staring up
At clouds as they gather overhead,
and the reality
of the bodhisattvas--
The one whose name is
Sheer Excellence,
and all the rest--
Uncovered fully in the light,
sending down upon them
showers of the rain
That brings them bliss,
cool soft rain,
rain of finest fragrance.
(16) And by this power may every being
Who lives in the animal realm be freed
From the terror of feeding off each other.
May those who live as craving spirits
Enjoy a life of peace and plenty,
Like humans of the isle of Haunting Voice.
(17) May a stream of milk descend from the hand
Of the Lord of Power, the Realized One,
The One Who Looks with Loving Eyes,
And may it fill the spirits who crave,
Washing them too in a gentle bath,
Leaving them cool and refreshed.

(18) And by this power may the blind
Open their eyes and see the beauty;
May the deaf hear the song of sound.
May every woman with child give birth
As Maya, the Buddha's angel mother,
Did him--without a hint of pain.
(19) May those without sufficient clothing
Be suddenly clothed; may the hungry
Be instantly filled with food.
May those who suffer now from thirst
Drink fine fresh water
And other delicious beverages.
(20) May every poor person there is
Find all the money they need;
May those who grieve be comforted.
May those who've lost hope
Find hope anew, and security
That will never leave them.
(21) May every single being who's sick
Within this entire universe
Be suddenly, totally, cured.
May every kind of disease
Ever known to living kind
Vanish now, forever.

(22) May all those in any kind of fear
Be suddenly freed from it.
May those imprisoned be released.
May those downtrodden come to power,
All of us living then as family,
In harmony with each other.
(23) May all of those who are on the road,
To anywhere at all, be safe
And comfortable, wherever they are now.
And may they without the slightest trouble
Find at the end of their journey the thing
They left their home to find.
(24) May all those who've left dry land
To travel in boats or ships
Accomplish all they set out to do.
May they cross the dangers of the waters
And then return safe to their homes,
And the arms of friends and family.
(25) May those who travel a barren waste,
Or mistake their way, who wander lost,
Suddenly come upon new companions
And find their way easily, free of fatigue,
Without the slightest danger of things
Like thieves or wild beasts.

(26) May holy angels come and protect
All those who live in fear, with nowhere
To go, no path to follow:
Small children, the elderly, those with on one
To help them; those who cannot sleep,
Those who are troubled, and the insane.
(27) May they spend every life they still have to live
Free of every obstacle to a spiritual life:
May they find firm feelings of faith,
And wisdom, and a perfect capacity
For love; may their physical needs
Be filled, may they lead good lives.
(28) May they have all they need to live, forever,
Without a moment's pause, as if they possessed
The treasure of the magic sky.
May they live together without ever quarreling,
Without ever hurting each other, enjoying instead
The freedom to live as they choose to.
(29) May every person who is small or shy,
Who has no confidence, become
Strong and full of grace.
May those who've lived a life of need
And suffered from it physically
Recover in resplendent health.

(30) May all who live in a place in society
Where they're not treated right transform
Forever to a position ideal.
May those who are looked down upon
Be raised up high, and their arrogant friends
Be tumbled to the ground.
(31) And by this goodness I have done
May every single suffering being
Give up every single harmful
Thought or word or deed;
Taking up always in its stead
Thoughts and words and deeds of virtue.
(32) May these beings never cease to strive
To reach the ultimate goal, for others;
And may their hearts be swept away
By the stream of loving conduct.
May they abandon every sort of dark behavior,
Remaining in the care of every Holy Being.
(33) May every living soul enjoy
A life immeasurably long,
Living thus forever in
A state of constant bliss,
So that even the very word "death"
Is never heard spoken again.

(34) May all the places that exist, in every world there is,
Turn instantly into gardens of elegant design,
Filled with trees that grant your every wish.
And may the Enlightened Ones, along with their daughters
And their sons, walk amidst the trees,
Singing out the sweet song of the Dharma.
(35) And in each one of these places
May the very foundation, the earth itself,
Be transformed, from sharp stones and the like,
Into the heavenly ground of lapis lazuli--
As smooth as the palm of your hand,
And soft to walk upon.
(36) And like a precious jewel
Adorning this same ground,
May all the secret worlds that exist
And all the goodness in them
Abide atop these newfound lands,
Crowded with Warrior Angels.
(37) And too, may all who live and breathe
Hear the song of birds,
The wind in the trees,
The light of the sun, and the sky itself,
Singing aloud to them an endless
Rhapsody of holy teachings.

(38) And wherever they go may they always meet
The Enlightened Ones, and their children
Who strive for enlightenment.
May they honor these Lamas--
The highest of beings--
With endless showers of offerings.
(39) May the lords of the sky
Send down the rains on time,
So to bring forth plentiful harvests.
May all existing governments
Make their decisions based on the teachings,
And thus may the whole world prosper.
(40) May every medicine come to have
The power to cure; may the secret words
Fulfil all hopes. May the minds
Of gods and spirits of sickness alike
Be overcome with thoughts of compassion.
(41) May no single living being
Ever again feel a single pain.
May they never again feel afraid,
Never again be hurt by another,
Never again be unhappy.
(42) May places of spiritual learning thrive,
Filled with people reading sacred books,
And singing them out loud as well.
May communities of spiritual practitioners
Live always in harmony, and may they achieve
The high goals for which they live together.

(43) May all those who have ever taken
The vows of a monk come to master
The arts of solitude,
Throwing off every kind of distraction,
Gradually refining their minds,
Learning perfect meditation.
(44) May nuns forever find support
For their physical needs, and live lives free
Of conflict or any outside threat.
May every person who's ever become
Ordained conduct themselves
Perfectly in their moral code.
(45) And may any of those who may have ever
Broken this code regret what they've done,
And always work to clean the karma.
May they then return to a higher birth,
And in their new life never see
Their spiritual discipline fail again.
(46) May every sage who lives in this world
Find the honor due to them, and always be offered
The food and other needs they request.
May they always take care that their hearts are pure,
And may they earn a good name that spreads
Throughout the entire world.

(47) May none of these people ever again
Undergo the pain of the lower realms;
In strength beyond the strength of gods
May they quickly win the state
Of a fully Enlightened One
Without the slightest hardship.
(48) May every suffering being there is
Make offerings over and over again
To every Enlightened Being there is.
And may the Enlightened Ones enjoy
Forever what we have offered them,
In infinite waves of bliss.
(49) May every plan there is in the heart
Of every bodhisattva to help
Every living being come true.
May everyone get every single thing
That the Enlightened Ones who shelter us
Have in mind for us to get.
(50) May those who follow the lower paths
Of self-made awakened ones, and listeners,
Attain the happiness they seek.

(51) And may we, through the kindness
Of Gentle Voice, remember in life after life
Who we are and what we practice,
Rejecting the worldly way of life
Again and again, until the day
We reach the level called Intense Joy.
(52) May we gain the mystic ability
To live off even the poorest of food,
Growing ever more strong and healthy.
In all our lives may we win the wealth
Of learning to live in solitude
With nothing more than barest needs.
(53) And when anyone ever longs to see him,
Or ask him even the slightest question,
May the shroud which covers their eyes
Be torn away, so that the High Protector,
Lord Gentle Voice Himself,
Instantly appears.
(54) We are working to achieve the goals
Of all the living things there are
In every corner of this universe;
And so by this power may we learn to do
Every single one of the things
That Gentle Voice is able to do.

(55) And may we decide that we will stay
To work to clear away the pain
Of every living being there is
Until the last day of this
Universe; until the very last
Suffering creature is changed.
(56) May every single pain that is coming
To any single being there is
Ripen now upon me instead.
May the great community of bodhisattvas
Go forth and spread through all the world,
To work for the happiness of all.
(57) The teachings of the Enlightened Ones
Are the one medicine that can cure
The great sickness of living kind.
They are the one ultimate source
Of every form of happiness.
And so by this power may the teachings remain
Long upon this planet, with all the support
They require, and all the respect they deserve.
(58) And lastly do I bow myself
Down to the One with a Gentle Voice,
The One who has been kind enough
To teach me the ways of virtue;
Thus last do I bow myself down
To the One who was kind enough
To raise me up from childhood:
I bow to You,
My Spiritual Guide.
