Here is the third division, [on the purpose served by the reasoning where one
proves the non-existence of something which does not appear]. A sutra states
the following:
I or someone like myself can judge a person, but no
normal person should judge another, for he will fall.

This statement itself expresses the purpose of the reasoning. What the Buddha
is saying here is that:
Without being able to see the real condition, you
should never say anything even close to "This person
has such and such faults. This person hasn't the least
good quality"--or "He or she has some good qualities,
but nothing more than that."

We never know who might be a holy being, and every open and secret
scripture there is says that the very finest way to end up in an unbearable birth
within the realms of misery is to speak badly about a holy being. Every
person who has any intelligence should therefore act with extreme caution in
this regard; treat such matters as though you were walking on the edge of a
great pit of glowing embers, innocently covered with powder of ash.

The implication suggested by the sutra above, and by the great treatises which
comment upon it, is that we must try to keep an attitude of wanting to help
all living creatures, of wanting to assure their happiness. So try to remain in
that pure vision where you see only pure good in other people. If you are not
capable of this, then at least it would be nice if you could try to speak badly
of others a little less than you do now.

Course IV: The Proof of Future Lives
Reading 1B: English Introduction to Geshe Yeshe Wangchuk's
Jewel of the True Thought
ENGLISH INTRODUCTION
Jewel of the True Thought is an important new treatise on the concept of valid
perception (prama¯n¸a or tsad-ma) in Buddhist philosophy. Its author is the
venerable Geshe Yeshe Wangchuk, an eminent scholar from the Sera Mey
college of Sera Tibetan Monastic University. The work has already taken its
place in the commentarial tradition of Buddhist literature.
Subject of the Work
The study of valid perception is of vital importance in Buddhist philosophy,
for it is this perception which allows us to determine the real nature of the
world around us and thereby escape pain, whether it be in the form of a mild
headache, or anxiety, or any undesirable object at all, on up to death itself.
This real nature of the world must be perceived not only with our direct
physical and mental senses, but by indirect methods such as reasoning, which
allows our minds to see important concepts such as the benefit of being moral.
Therefore the study of perception is tied to the study of reasoning, or
logic--and these form the core of the subject matter of the Commentary on Valid
Perception, the classical text which this book explains.
The Commentarial Tradition
The Commentary on Valid Perception (Prama¯n¸ava¯rttika, or Tsad-ma rnam-'grel) is
a work in four chapters by the Indian Buddhist master, Dharmakrti. As with
many early Buddhist sages, we know little of his life or even the dates that he
lived; Western scholars place him at around 630 AD, although even this is
uncertain. The "valid perception" in the title of his masterwork refers to

another treatise, the Compendium on Valid Perception (Prama¯n¸asamuccaya, or Tsad-
ma kun-btus), and Master Dharmakrti's text is actually a defense of this piece.
The Compendium was itself composed by Master Dignga, who is considered
the father of the Buddhist logic traditions and is dated by Western scholars at
around 440 AD, although again there is considerable uncertainty, and
according to tradition he was a direct teacher of Master varasena, who is said
to have been the direct teacher of Master Dharmakrti.
The philosopher Dignga was for his part commenting upon the concepts of
perception and logic presented in the teachings of kyamuni Buddha, who
lived 500 BC. And so the lineage goes from the Buddha, to Master Dignga,
to Master Dharmakrti, and then on to the early Indian explanations of Master
Dharmakrti, including his own autocommentary.
Looking backwards from our present time, it is typical for a modern Tibetan
commentator of the Gelukpa tradition to base his work on one of the monastic
textbooks, typically written in the 17th or 18th century for the curriculum of
a specific monastic college. These textbooks are themselves based on a
preceding generation of commentaries composed in the 15th century by
Tsongkapa the Great (1357-1419) or by one of the scholars of his immediate
school.
Here two important works are the Jewel of Reasoning (Tsad-ma rigs-rgyan) of the
First Dalai Lama, Gyalwa Gendun Drup (1391-1474), and Light on the Path to
Freedom (Thar-lam gsal-byed) by Gyaltsab Je (1362-1432), who was the great first
regent of Je Tsongkapa's school. These texts are based on the Indian
commentaries to Master Dharmakrti's work, and thus the entire commentarial
tradition stretches through 25 centuries, from kyamuni Buddha up to the
great Tibetan philosophical masters of our own time.
About the Author
Very few people alive today are capable of even reading and comprehending
the Commentary on Valid Perception, so we are fortunate to have in Geshe Yeshe
Wangchuk a scholar who is moreover qualified to write a commentary that
gives us a door to travel back into the increasingly more difficult earlier
explanations.
Gyaltsab Je's Light on the Path, for example, is so deep and packed with
analysis that only a handful of students in the traditional monastic curriculum
ever get further than the second of its four chapters, despite the fact that a
month of intense debate is devoted to the book every year in course of a
monk's philosophical studies, which take up to two decades. And without

understanding this generation of commentaries, it is difficult to grasp
accurately the Indian commentaries, without which the original stras can
hardly be appreciated in depth.
Geshe Yeshe Wangchuk was born in 1928 in the Tarlam region of Kham,
eastern Tibet, and entered the monastic life at the age of eight. When he was
fifteen he travelled to Lhasa, the national capital, and entered the Sera Mey
college of Sera Monastic University, considered one of the greatest educational
institutions of the country.
For seventeen years he devoted himself to an intense study of the classical texts
of Buddhism, winning honors in every area of the traditional curriculum. He
became an accomplished debater, and gave successful defenses of his
knowledge in public oral examinations at every one of the great Gelukpa
colleges. At an early point in his scholastic career he had already taken on
students of his own.
His knowledge was not gained without great effort. He would devote long
and tireless hours to the college debate ground, where student monks meet to
review their daily lessons in heated philosophical debates. His free time was
given almost entirely to memorization of the great philosophical texts, a
traditional requirement of a monk's training. He would recite his texts from
memory late into the night, and to keep himself from falling asleep would
perch high in a tree, or on a large boulder, where the self-imposed punishment
for dozing off would be a nasty fall. In this manner Geshe Wangchuk was able
to commit to memory literally thousands of pages of the original works, and
became something of a walking encyclopedia.
As a result of his philosophical acumen and vast store of knowledge, he
received highest honors in the final examinations that mark the end of the long
course to become a Geshe, or master of Buddhist philosophy.
In the difficult period following the loss of Tibet, Geshe Wangchuk suffered
greatly. He was imprisoned for some time and then, during the "Cultural"
Revolution, assigned to hard labor. In 1977 he was appointed to the Bureau
of Cultural Preservation, where he devoted himself to a research of written and
physical antiquities. He has travelled to China on various occasions and, with
the relaxation of some of the previous restrictions, has visited Japan and India.
In recent years Geshe Wangchuk has made exceptional efforts to help preserve
the Buddhist religion in Tibet. He has played a leading role in the restoration
of the literary classics of the country, and has served in Beijing as a university
professor of Buddhist philosophy, as well as performing the duties of a
traditional lama by teaching many students in Lhasa and other parts of Tibet.

He also assisted the late Panchen Lama in his efforts to gain the release of the
many monks imprisoned during demonstrations for a free Tibet.
Among the notable events of his life, Geshe Wangchuk includes the traditional
acts of generosity he has performed for monks and monasteries during his
trips to India. Despite his limited means, he has made donations to help build
new temples and support needy refugee monks. The most important part of
any Buddhist's life is the success of his relationship with his spiritual
instructors, and in his autobiography Geshe Wangchuk describes his studies
under some thirty great religious teachers. In his usual modest way he
concludes that "On the good side, I have never once in my life deprecated one
of my lamas; and yet, on the bad side, I don't feel that I was able to pay proper
service to any one of them either."
Geshe Wangchuk has composed a great many original works. In his student
days he wrote a eulogy of Je Tsongkapa and essays on difficult points of the
Madhyamika and Vaibh ika schools of Buddhist thought; all these papers
were destroyed in the upheaval during the loss of Tibet.
Throughout the 1960's he continued writing on various subjects, but again
these manuscripts were all burned during the chaotic "Cultural" Revolution.
Since this time he has been a prolific writer, publishing works on the
comparative study of the classical philosophical schools of Buddhism; an
historical essay of 21 great Tibetan monasteries; numerous articles in Buddhist
journals; versed petitions and prayers to eminent lamas; and a summary of the
500-year history of Sera Mey College.
In the past few years, Geshe Wangchuk has been allowed to travel outside of
Tibet for extended teaching tours, and has greatly benefitted the students and
teachers of the Tibetan refugee community in India. Within the last year he
has given an extensive public discourse on the entire text of Liberation in Our
Hands, an immense description of the lam-rim or steps on the path to
enlightenment, composed by the illustrious Pabongka Rinpoche, Dechen
Nyingpo. He has also found time to give public teachings on the subjects of
logic and valid perception set forth in the present book. It is greatly hoped
that he will enjoy the freedom and health to continue this great work.
The details of Geshe Wangchuk's life mentioned here have been summarized
from a brief autobiographical work currently under publication by the press
of Sera Mey College. The final pages of this text contain exquisite verses that
describe his own life and practice, and it would not be inappropriate to include
a few of these lines here, to show the value of modesty in the thinking of a
great man:

It is an excellent thing
That I have imparted to others
The power to learn and become
The mystical worlds and beings;
It's though a thing that makes me sad
That I myself have never
Seen the slightest vision
Of an angel's face.
It is a thing of goodness
That I have paid my visits
To very holy places
And spared no effort there;
It's though a thing that makes me sad
That they could not affect me
And here I am exactly
As I was before.
It is a thing of goodness
That I have had the chance
To meet and seek the blessings
Of many thousand lamas;
It's though a thing that makes me sad
That I remain no more
Than a hollow log of wood
That never could be blessed.
It is a thing of goodness
That in society
I've dressed up in the handsome
Robes of a Buddhist monk;
It's though a thing that makes me sad
That on my inside rains
A steady shower of sins,
Of evil thoughts, of wrong.
It is a thing of goodness
That I've donned the ritual robes
And taken in my hands
The holy bell and scepter;

It's though a thing that makes me sad
That still I'm stuck in seeing
The world as ordinary,
And as no paradise.
It is a nice thing people speak
Of me in flattering terms
And give me all those titles
I really don't deserve;
It's though a thing that makes me sad
That actually I've not
The moral strength to watch
What I do and say.
It is a true thing, that if you
Don't look very closely
I seem to you a monk
With the cleanest vows.
It's though a thing that makes me sad
That if you really check
You'll find I've not the slightest
Thing to show you now.
But of course he does, and in the present work Geshe Wangchuk shows
himself one of the greatest living scholars of the Buddhist logic tradition.
About the Text
Geshe Wangchuk has completed a commentary to all four chapters of the
Commentary on Valid Perception, a formidable accomplishment since each
chapter is practically a separate philosophical classic in its own right; this is
borne out by the fact that numerous commentators on the work over the
centuries have, for various reasons, written explanations of only one or a few
of its chapters--Master Dharmakrti himself was unable to complete the entire
autocommentary during his lifetime.
The first two chapters of the present commentary have been published in Tibet
and also at the new Sera Mey College in south India. These books contain
some printing errors that are serious enough to justify a new edition, and the
galleys to a companion first volume of the present book are currently under
correction by the author himself, after which they will be published.

This is the first printing of the commentary to the third and fourth chapters,
and due to the difficulty of the text a considerable amount of editing work was
required. The editing was performed by a team under the direction of the
venerable Geshe Thupten Rinchen, a student of Geshe Wangchuk's from the
Tsangpa House of Sera Mey College, and himself one of the most capable
scholars of Buddhist philosophy alive.
Fortunately, Geshe Wangchuk himself received permission to visit India just
before the publication deadline, and was able to review the work in its entirety
and make his own final corrections.
The book was typeset at the Sera Mey Computer Center, under the auspices
of the Asian Classics Input Project. ACIP is a non-profit effort to preserve the
important literature of Asia in digital format and distribute it throughout the
world on computer diskettes. The editor-in-chief and founder of ACIP is the
venerable Khen Rinpoche Geshe Lobsang Tharchin, a former abbot of Sera
Mey.
ACIP was begun through a grant from the Packard Humanities Institute, and
the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. It currently receives funding from
various institutions, including the National Endowment for the Humanities
(NEH) and the Buddhist Cultural Exchange Research of Yuisho Ji, Japan.
Please refer to the statement of details of NEH support for ACIP on the
copyright page of this publication.
The actual printing of the book has been completed under the able direction
of Mr. Praveen Sareen of Classics of India Publications, Delhi, India.
Dedication
The majority of the cost of this publication (for 500 copies) has been borne by
the venerable Lhatsun Rinpoche, a young monk scholar and reincarnated lama
from the Shungpa House of Sera Mey College, on the occasion of his standing
for his Rikchung degree examination in June of 1992 (Tibetan Royal year 2119).
He dedicates the virtuous power of this good deed first to his ability to
preserve and uphold the great works of his previous incarnations.
He secondly prays that this goodness will help his father, Jampa Sopa, and his
mother, Tsewang Drolma, and all the members of his family of disciples and
dependents to achieve success in any virtuous task they may undertake.
Finally he would like to acknowledge and express his appreciation for the
efforts of Michael Roach in preparing this work for publication, and prays for
the ultimate accomplishment of his wishes.

An additional 200 copies of this work have been sponsored by the venerable
Lhundrup Lekden, upon the occasion of his standing for his Lharampa Geshe
examinations. He dedicates the virtuous power of this good deed to the long
and fruitful life of his spiritual teachers. He prays that it may help clear away
any and all of the past bad deeds and spiritual obstacles of those dear to him
who have passed away, beginning with his own mother, Sonam Kyipa; and he
prays it may bring them to final enlightenment. He prays lastly that this good
work may keep his father, Tenzin, and all others of their friends and family
who are still in this world from any harm, and bring them each a long and
deeply religious life.

Reading Three: The Definition of Correct Perception

The following is a selection from the Jewel of the True Thought, by the great
scholar Geshe Yeshe Wangchuk, in explanation of the Commentary on Correct
Perception by Master Dharmakirti.

,THUB PA TSAD MAR BSGRUB PA LA GNYIS, LUGS 'BYUNG GI SGO NAS STON PA LAM GANG NAS BYON PA'I TSUL BSTAN PA DANG , LUGS LDOG GI SGO NAS DE LTAR BYON PA'I SHES BYED BSTAN PA'O,
Proving that the Able One is totally correct has two parts. The first is to show
what path it was that He came by; this involves the forward order. The second
is to show the evidence to establish that he did come this way; this involves
the reverse order.

,DANG PO LA, TSAD MAR GYUR PA'I DON BSHAD PA'I SGO NAS TSAD MA'I SKYES BU'I MTSAN GZHI NGOS GZUNG BA DANG , LHAG MA BZHI BSHAD PA'I SGO NAS TSAD MA'I SKYES BU'I MTSAN NYID DANG , DER BGROD PA'I LAM NGOS GZUNG BA'O,
The first of these has three parts of its own. The first is identifying a typical
example of a person who is totally correct, by explaining the meaning of the
words "Who turned correct." The second is to identify the definition of a
person who is totally correct, which is done by explaining the remaining four

elements of the statement. And the third is to identify the path by which one
travels to this state.

,DANG PO LA, TSAD MA SPYI'I MTSAN NYID DANG , THUB PA'ANG MTSAN NYID DE DANG LDAN PAR BSTAN PA'O, , DANG PO LA, MTSAN NYID KYI NGO BO DANG , KHYAD PAR RO,
The first of these has as well two sections. The first is the definition of correct
perception in general. The second is a demonstration that this definition does
moreover apply to the Able One. Our discussion of the definition itself will
proceed in two steps: the essence of the definition, and a detail of the
definition.

,DANG PO LA, MTSAN NYID DANG , MTSAN GZHI DANG MTSAN GZHI LA MTSAN NYID NGES BYED DO, DANG PO LA, MI SLU BA NGOS GZUNG BA DANG , DE LA MA KHYAB PA SPANG BA DANG , KHYAB CHES PA SPANG BA'O,
The essence of the definition is itself divided into the definition, a typical
example, and establishing that the definition applies to this example. For the
definition we will first have to identify what it means to be "unerring," then
refute that it might not be comprehensive, and finally refute that it could be
too comprehensive.

,MI SLU BA NGOS GZUNG BA LA, RTZA BA LAS,
,TSAD MA BSLU MED CAN SHES PA,
,DON BYED NUS PAR GNAS PA NI,
,MI SLU   
The identification of what it means to be "unerring" is found in two and a half
lines of the root text:
Correct perception is a state of mind unerring;
To be in a condition able to perform a function
Is what "unerring" means.

ZHES PA'I TSIG PHYED DANG GSUM STE, SKYES BU'I MNGON MTHO DANG NGES LEGS BSGRUB PA'I THABS DANG BCAS PA NI TSAD MA'I GZHAL BYA YIN ZHING , DE DAG THAMS CAD LA THUB PA NYID MI SLU BA YIN PAS SPYIR TSAD MA'I MTSAN NYID DE GANG ZHE NA, GSAR DU BSLU BA MED PA CAN GYI SHES PA DE, TSAD MA'I MTSAN NYID DANG ,
The thing that correct perception undertakes to perceive is the existence of and
the means for a person to attain a birth in the higher realms, as well as definite
good. The Able One is the one being who is unerring with regard to all of
these things; and so, if you should wonder how correct perception is defined,
we can state that "a fresh state of mind which is unerring" is the definition of
correct perception.

MI SLU BA'I DON YANG , BTZO BSREG LA SOGS PA'I DON BYED NUS PAR SHES PA DES JI LTAR RTOGS PA LTAR DON LA GNAS PA DE'O,
And what is the meaning of "unerring"? Suppose you perceive something as
being able to perform the function of cooking or burning something else.
Your perception is "unerring" when this thing does actually exist in the
condition you have perceived it to be.

,SHES PA GANG YIN ZHES DGONGS PHYIR,
,RANG GI MTSAN NYID DPYAD PHYIR RO,
Here secondly is a detail of the definition, which is indicated in six lines from
the root text:
It must also illuminate something not perceived.
Subsequent to perceiving the thing in its very essence,
You have a more general type of experience.
It's because the intent when they mention a perception
Is one that has not perceived a definitive object.
Because it discerns its own definitive object.

,ZHES TSIG DRUG GONG DU BSHAD PA'I MI SLU BA TZAM GYIS TSAD MA'I MTSAN NYID YONGS SU MI RDZOGS TE, SNGAR MA SHES PA'I DON GYI GSAL BYED DE DANG PO'AM GSAR DU SHES PAS KYANG MTSAN NYID KYI ZUR DU SMOS DGOS PA'I PHYIR, DES NA, GSAR DU MI SLU BA'I SHES PA, TSAD MA'I MTSAN NYID YIN NO,
What this is saying is that the requirement described above, that a perception
be "unerring," is not by itself enough to complete the entire definition of correct
perception. This is because the perception must be one which illuminates
something that was not perceived previously; and so we must also mention
at some point in the definition that the object is known "for the first time," or
"freshly." As such, the standard definition for correct perception is "a fresh and
unerring perception."

,DON GSAR DU GSAL BYED TSAD MA YIN NA, SNGON PO NGES PA'I BCAD SHES CHOS CAN, TSAD MA YIN PAR THAL, GSAR DU RTOGS PA'I SHES PA YIN PA'I PHYIR, DER THAL, SNGON PO'I DON SPYI GSAR DU RTOGS PA'I SHES PA YIN PA'I PHYIR ZHE NA,
Someone might make the following objection. "Suppose we allow you to
define correct perception as a fresh illumination of an object. Consider then
a recollection in which you perceive the color blue. According to you,
wouldn't this have to be a correct perception? Because isn't it a state of mind
which realizes its object and is fresh? And it is just that, for it is a state of
mind which is a fresh perception of the mental image of the color blue."

SKYON MED DE, SNGON 'DZIN MNGON SUM GYIS SNGON PO RANG GI NGO BO THUN MONG MA YIN PA

Yet there is no such problem. What happens is that the state of mind which
grasps the color blue directly perceives that very essence of blueness which is
unique to it. Subsequent to this perception you have a more general
experience, where your mind grasps to a mental image of the color blue. This
latter state of mind though does not have the ability to discern the object on
its own power alone. If something is correct perception, it must be a fresh
perception of a definitive object that it has not perceived before, or else must
be directly dependent upon such a perception. Incidentally, you should
understand the phrase "definitive object" here as referring to an object as it
exists in its own essence.

Reading Four: Showing that the Buddha has the Qualities
of Correct Perception

Showing that the Qualities of Correct Perception
Are as well Possessed by the Victorious Buddha

,, SER SMAD SPOM RA DGE BSHES YE SHES DBANG PHYUG GI TSAD MA RNAM 'GREL GYI DGONGS PA'I RGYAN LAS,
From Jewel of the True Thought of the Commentary on Correct Perception, by Geshe
Yeshe Wangchuk, of the Pomra College of Sera Mey Tibetan Monastery:

,GNYIS PA THUB PA'ANG MTSAN NYID DE DANG LDAN PAR BSTAN PA LA GNYIS, TSAD MA'I DON BSHAD ZIN DANG SBYAR BA DANG , GYUR PA'I DON BSHAD PA'O, , DANG PO NI, RTZA BAR,
,DE LDAN BCOM LDAN TSAD MA NYID,
CES TSIG GCIG,
Here secondly we show that the qualities of correct perception are as well
possessed by the victorious Buddha. We proceed in two steps: bridging this
explanation to the meaning of correct perception already presented, and
explaining the meaning of the words "who turned." The first of the two is
conveyed in the root text with the line,
The one who has it is the Victorious One;
Perfectly correct itself.

,THUB PA BCOM LDAN 'DAS CHOS CAN, CHOS THAMS CAD LA TSAD MA YIN TE, DE THAMS CAD LA GSAR DU MI SLU BA'I SHES PA DE DANG LDAN ZHING DE YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Consider the Victorious One, the able Buddha. He is perfectly correct
towards each and every existing object, for He is the one who has "it": that is,
who has a fresh and unerring perception of all these objects, and who is that
itself.

GTZO BO NI, RNAM MKHYEN DES JI LTA JI SNYED KYI CHOS RNAMS RANG DBANG DU MNGON SUM GYIS GZIGS PA'I TSAD MA YIN LA, THUB PA'ANG RNAM MKHYEN DE DANG LDAN PAR BSTAN PA'O, , DE NI, SANGS 'PHAGS KYI RGYUD LA YE SHES MED PAR 'DOD PA'ANG KHEGS SO,
The main point here is to show that omniscience is a correct perception which
sees directly, and on its own power, each and every existing object: the nature
of all things, and the totality of all things. And the Buddha is as well a being
who possesses this omniscience. Incidentally, this fact also disproves the belief
that realized persons who are Buddhas do not possess the mental function of
wisdom.

,SKABS 'DIR, THAR LAM GSAL BYED DANG YIG CHA 'GA' ZHIG LAS, RNAM MKHYEN SKAD CIG DANG POS MA GZIGS SHING , RNAM MKHYEN SKAD CIG GNYIS PAS GSAR DU GZIGS PA'I CHOS SHIG YOD PAR GSUNG ZIN LA 'KHOD 'DUG PAS DE LTAR KHAS LEN NA, DE 'DRA'I CHOS DE CHOS CAN, RNAM MKHYEN SKAD CIG DANG POS GZIGS PAR THAL, GZHI GRUB PA'I PHYIR, DER THAL, RNAM MKHYEN SKAD CIG DANG PO CHOS THAMS CAD MNGON SUM DU RTOGS PA'I YE SHES YIN PA'I PHYIR, DER THAL, RNAM MKHYEN YIN PA'I PHYIR, MA KHYAB NA, RNAM PA THAMS CAD MKHYEN NYID LAM ZHES GSUNG ,
At this juncture, Light on the Path to Freedom and a number of monastic
textbooks present the following argument. The wording of the root text
implies that there exists some object which is not seen by the first moment of
omniscience, but which is seen fresh by the second moment of omniscience.

Suppose that one therefore accepts such an object. Consider this object. Isn't
it true that it must be seen by the first moment of omniscience? Because isn't
it something that is? And isn't this necessarily so, since the first moment of
omniscience is a kind of wisdom which perceives, directly, each and every
existing object? And isn't this so, since it is omniscience? And suppose you
say that just because something is omniscience doesn't mean it perceives
directly each and every object. What then about the quotation [from the Jewel
of Realizations by Master Asanga] which states, "It is the path which is the one
knowledge of each and every kind of object"?

,RTZA BAR MA GRUB NA, DE CHOS CAN, GZHI GRUB PAR THAL, RNAM MKHYEN SKAD CIG GNYIS PAS GSAR DU RTOGS PA'I CHOS YIN PA'I PHYIR, MA GRUB NA, KHAS BLANG DANG 'GAL,
Suppose now you disagree to our original statement, [where we said that the
object is something which is.] Consider again this object [which is supposedly
not seen by the first moment of omniscience but is seen by the second
moment]. It is true that it is, for it is an object which is perceived fresh by
omniscience of the second moment. If you say it is not, then you contradict
your own position.

,RANG RE'I YIG CHA BLO RIG LAS, RTOGS ZIN RTOGS PA'I RIG PA, BCAD SHES KYI MTSAN NYID DU BZHAG, YIG CHA GZHAN RNAMS, RTOGS ZIN RTOGS PA'I TSAD MIN GYI RIG PA, BCAS SHES KYI MTSAN NYID DU 'JOG, THAR LAM GSAL BYED LAS, KHO BO NI KHA NANG DU PHYOGS NAS JI TZAM BSAMS KYANG , TSAD MA MA YIN PA'I KUN MKHYEN DANG , TSAD MA LA GSAR RTOGS KYIS MA KHYAB PA MA TSOR RO, , ZHES PA BSAM NA RNAM MKHYEN SKAD CIG GNYIS PA PHAN CHAD RANG YUL GSAR RTOGS YOD PAR GSUNG ,
Our own textbooks, in the section on the study of the mind, define recollection
as "A state of mind where you perceive what you have already perceived
before." The textbooks of certain other monasteries say that the definition of
recollection is "A state of mind which is not correct perception, and where you
perceive what you have already perceived before." Light on the Path to Freedom
says,

No matter how much we look within ourselves and
think it over, we cannot detect any case where
omniscience could be anything other than correct
perception, or where there could be any case of correct
perception that were not a fresh perception.
If you consider this quotation carefully, you can see that it is stating that the
second and following moments of omniscience are fresh perceptions towards
their objects.

,RNAM MKHYEN SKAD CIG DANG POS DUS GSUM CIG CAR DU MA GZIGS NA, DUS GSUM CIG CAR DU GZIGS PA'I YE SHES MED PAR 'GYUR RO, , GZIGS NA 'BYUNG 'GYUR GYI CHOS RNAMS GZIGS DGOS PAS SKAD CIG GNYIS PA PHAN CHAD RTOGS ZIN CING MA GZIGS PA'I CHOS MED PA'I PHYIR, KHO BOS RNAM MKHYEN SKAD CIG DANG PO DANG , DE'I SKAD CIG GNYIS PA GNYIS KYI GZHAL BYA YIN KHYAB MNYAM TU 'DOD DO,
If the first moment of omniscience does not see the past, present, and future
all at once, then there could be no wisdom which sees all these three times at
once. If it does see these three, then it would have to see all objects which are
going to occur in the future. As such there could be no object which the
second and following moments perceived which had not already been
perceived before, or which the first moment had not perceived. Therefore our
own position is that the group of things which are discerned by the first
moment of omniscience and the group of things which are discerned by the
second moment of omniscience are completely identical.

,'O NA RNAM MKHYEN SKAD CIG GNYIS PA CHOS CAN, RTOGS ZIN RTOGS PA'I RIG PA YIN PAR THAL, RNAM MKHYEN SKAD CIG DANG POS RTOGS ZIN PA'I DON KHO NA RTOGS PA'I PHYIR ZER NA MA KHYAB, RNAM MKHYEN SKAD CIG GNYIS PA DES, DE LTAR RTOGS KYANG , SKAD CIG DANG PO'I STOBS KYIS MI 'JUG PAR RANG STOBS KYIS YUL RTOGS PA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
One may then make the following objection:
If that's the case, then let's consider the second
moment of omniscience. Isn't it then a state of mind
which perceives something which it has already
perceived before? Because isn't the only thing it
perceives then exactly the same thing which has
already been perceived by the first moment of
omniscience?
Our answer is that it doesn't necessarily follow. Although it is true that the
second moment of omniscience does perceive what it does in the way
described, it does not engage in its object by force of the first moment of
omniscience, but rather perceives its object on its own power.

,SGRUB BYED LA LTOS TSAD YIN RIGS,
ZHES TSIGS GSUM,
Here secondly is our explanation of the meaning of the words "who turned."
First we will describe the necessity for mentioning "who turned," and then after
that discuss some objections to this description. The first point here is covered
in the following three lines of the root text:
The phrase that goes "who turned"
Is spoken in the sense
Of the opposite of something
Which wasn't ever developed.
This as well is why it's right
That correctness depends on achieving.

,SLOB DPON PHYOGS GLANG GIS, TSAD MA KUN BTUS KYI MCHOD BRJOD DU TSAD MAR GYUR PA ZHES SMOS PA LA, RNAM BCAD KYI DGOS PA NI, TSAD MA'I SKYES BU DE RANG GI RGYU LAS MA SKYES PA LDOG PA'I DON DU GYUR PA GSUNG PA'I PHYIR,
There are two reason why Master Dignaga, in the verse of the offering of
praise at the beginning of his work, the Compendium on Correct Perception,
mentions the phrase "who turned." The first purpose for these words is the
kind that is meant to exclude something. Here they are spoken in the sense
of the opposite: they are meant to indicate that a person who is totally correct
could never be something that didn't ever develop from its proper cause.

,YONGS GCOD KYI DGOS PA NI, THABS SHES KYI SGRUB BYED GOMS PA MTHAR PHYIN PA LA BLTOS NAS TSAD MAR 'KHRUNGS PA GO BA'I CHED YIN PA'I PHYIR,
The second purpose for these words is the kind that is meant to imply
something. Here the point we are supposed to grasp is that one develops into
a person of total correctness only by depending on reaching the final
perfection of a gradual practice of all the various methods used for achieving
this state.

Reading 5A: Disproving Wrong Ideas on the Nature of
Omniscience

,SER SMAD DGE BSHES YE SHES DBANG PHYUG MCHOG GIS BRTZOM PA'I RNAM 'GREL 'GREL PA TSAD MA DGONGS RGYAN LAS,
The following is a selection from the Jewel of the True Thought, a commentary
on Master Dharmakirti's Commentary on Valid Perception by Geshe Yeshe
Wangchuk of Sera Mey Tibetan Monastery.

GNYIS PA DE LA RTZOD SPANG BA LA, SHES BYA THAMS CAD BZO SHES PA KUN MKHYEN YIN PA DGAG PA DANG , THAMS CAD KYI GNAS LUGS JI LTAR GNAS PA MNGON SUM DU SHES PA KUN MKHYEN DU BSGRUB PA'O,
Here secondly is our refutation of arguments against our position. We will
proceed in two steps: disproving the idea that someone who created every
knowable thing could be an omniscient being, and proving that someone who
could perceive directly the actual way in which each and every knowable thing
exists is an omniscient being.

DANG PO LA, THAMS CAD KYI BYED PO'I DBANG PHYUG GI NGO BO DGAG PA DANG , SGRUB BYED DGAG PA'O,
The first of these two has two steps itself: disproving the very nature of some
Lord of Power who created every knowable thing, and disproving the
attempted proofs for his existence.

DANG PO LA, RTAG PA DGAG PA DANG , MI RTAG PA YIN PA DGAG PA'O, , RTAG PA YIN PA DGAG PA LA,
The first of these has two parts: disproving a Lord of Power who is
unchanging, and disproving one who is changing.
Disproving a Lord of Power who is unchanging is presented in the following
seven lines of the root text by Master Dharmakirti:

RTZA BAR, , TSAD MA RTAG PA NYID YOD MIN,
,DNGOS YOD RTOGS PA TSAD PHYIR DANG ,
,SHES BYA MI RTAG PA NYID KYIS,

,BLTOS PA MI RUNG BA YI PHYIR,
,ZHES TSIG BDUN,
A correct perception which exists
as unchanging could never be;
This is because it's a correct perception
towards something that's a working thing.
And since the thing it knows
is something which is changing,
It too can only be something
which has no stability.

It's true as well since things that arise
in stages gradually
Could never be something that arises
from a thing that is unchanging,
And neither could they properly be
things which must depend.

GZHAN SDES THAMS CAD KYI BYED PA PO DBANG PHYUG RTAG PA RANG BYUNG GI TSAD MA'I SKYES BU YIN NO ZHE NA, LHA DBANG PHYUG DE THAMS CAD LA TSAD MAR KHAS LEN PAS, YUL DNGOS POR YOD PA RTOGS PA'I TSAD MA YIN DGOS,
Some other groups say that there is a being who created every existing thing:
the Lord of Power, who is unchanging. He, they say, is a being who is totally
correct, and who just came that way from the beginning. Now since these
groups assert that this powerful deity is a being with correct perception
towards every existing thing, they must agree that he has correct perception
towards objects of his mind which are working things.

DE YIN NA, TSAD MA RTAG PA NYID DU YOD PA MIN TE, YUL MI RTAG PA RTOGS PA'I PHYIR, KHYAB STE, YUL SHES BYA MI RTAG PA NYID YIN NA, , DE 'JAL GYI TSAD MA DE MI BRTAN PA NYID YIN DGOS PA'I PHYIR,
Suppose he did have such a perception. This correct perception--which exists
as something unchanging--could never be, because it perceives an object of
the mind which is changing. This is always the case, for if the thing it
knows--the object of the mind--is something which is changing, then it too
(the correct perception which engages in this object) can only be something
which has no stability.

BSKYED PA MA YIN TE, RTAG PA RKYEN LA BLTOS PA MI RUNG BA YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Now suppose you say that this Lord of Power is himself unchanging. Since
you agree that the mind of this Lord is changing, you must agree that his mind
arises. And yet this mind could never arise from a Lord of Power who was
unchanging, because it arises in stages, gradually. Neither could the mind
arise through dependence on certain conditions, for nothing which is
unchanging can properly be a thing which must depend on something else.

The Great Commentary, Ocean of Reasoning, presents some additional points
here. It is a contradiction for the subject mind to be unchanging if the object
it perceives is changing; but on the other hand it is not necessarily the case
that, just because the object the mind perceives is unchanging, the subject mind
itself must be unchanging.

YUL CAN DES, YUL RTOGS PA DE DUS RTAG TU 'JAL LAM RES 'GA' 'JAL, RTAG TU 'JAL NA, YUL DE'ANG RTAG TU YOD PAR 'GYUR BAS MI RTAG PA YIN PA 'GAL,
This is because of the following. When the subject mind perceives its object,
does it engage in the object all the time, or does it engage in the object
intermittently? If it engages all the time, then the object would have to be
there all the time, which is a contradiction, since the object is changing.

RE 'GA' 'JAL NA, YUL RTOGS PA DE RGYU RKYEN LA BLTOS PAR 'GYUR BAS MI RTAG PA YIN DGOS SO, , YUL RTAG PA YIN NA'ANG YUL CAN RTAG PA YIN MI DGOS TE, YUL CAN GYIS YUL RTOGS PA RGYU RKYEN LA BLTOS PA'I PHYIR,
If you answer that the subject engages the object intermittently, then the
perception of the object must depend on certain factors, and so it would have
to be changing.
It is true that, even it the object is unchanging, the subject mind that perceives

it need not be unchanging. This is because the perception of the object by the
subject depends on certain causes and conditions.

'GA' ZHIG GIS SKABS 'DIR THA SNYAD PA'I TSAD MA RTAG PA BKAG PA YIN ZER, 'O NA, DON DAM PA'I TSAD MA CHOS CAN, KHYOD KYI YUL DU MI RTAG PA MED PAR THAL LO, , GANGS CAN GYI ZHING DU RNAM MKHYEN RTAG PAR KHAS LEN PA'I GRUB MTHA' RNAMS NI, RIGS PA'I DBANG PHYUG GI GZHUNG DE DANG RGYAB 'GAL DU SONG BA YIN NO,
Some people claim that what's being disproved at this point is a conventional
correct perception that was unchanging. Consider then ultimate perception.
According to you then there cannot be any changing thing which acts as its
object. Those schools here in the Land of Snow which assert that omniscience
is unchanging have come to a point of direct contradiction against the great
work of this Lord of Reasoning.

,RNAM 'AGS PHAN GDAGS BYA MIN PHYIR,
,MI RTAG NA YANG TSAD MED NYID,
,CES TSIG GNYIS,
Here secondly is how we deny a Lord of Power who is something that
changes. The root text presents the point in two lines:
Because there are not things at all
which help him any way,
There is no correct perception at all
even if he were changing.

GONG GI RIGS PA DE DAG MI BZOD NAS, DBANG PHYUG MI RTAG PA YIN YANG , 'KHOR BA'I DUS SU CHAGS SOGS NYAMS SU MYONG NAS, DE'I GNYEN PO GOMS PA'I SGRUB BYED 
LA BLTOS PA MIN PAR, THOG MA NAS CHAGS BRAL DANG KUN MKHYEN YIN NO ZER,
Suppose even that someone were unable to bear the above reasoning, and
claimed instead that the Lord of Power were changing. They would say that
he was from the very beginning a person free of all desire, and omniscient,
without having to go through the process of experiencing desire and all the
rest during his time in the circle of rebirth, and then depending on practices
wherein he meditated on the antidotes.

DBANG PHYUG RIGS 'DRA SNGA MA LAS SKYES PA'I KUN MKHYEN YIN PA LA SGRUB BYED KYI TSAD MA NYID MED PAR THAL, DBANG PHYUG 'KHOR BA'I GNAS SKABS SU KUN NAS NYON MONGS PAS GNOD PA DANG , RNAM BYANG GI CHOS KYIS PHAN GDAGS PAR BYA BA RNAM PA 'AGS KYANG MIN PA'I PHYIR,
But isn't it true that there is no correct perception at all that can establish the
existence of a state of omniscience which has arisen from a Lord of Power of
the past who is of the same type? Because isn't it true that this Lord of Power
is someone who has never been harmed by the afflicted side of existence
during a period when he was living in the circle of rebirth; and someone who
has never been helped by the pure side of existence? Isn't it true that there are
no things at all that have affected him in any such way?

On these two lines, the Great Commentary starts from the reason that it is
incorrect to say that an unchanging thing could arise from certain conditions,
and proceeds to saying that, as far as the denial of being changing, the Lord
of Power is admittedly changing; but that it is incorrect to assert that he is
omniscient. Based on this presentation it seems a little delicate to call this
section the "denial of something that changes."

The following is a selection from the Jewel of the True Thought, a commentary
on Master Dharmakirti's Commentary on Valid Perception by Geshe Yeshe
Wangchuk of Sera Mey Tibetan Monastery.

Here thirdly is the section on identifying what it is to be omniscient. The root
text of Master Chandrakirti says:
The thing that we agree to be
totally correct
Is the one who has knowledge of
the fact of what it is
That we should take up and give up,
and the method too;
It's not though one who knows
everything there is.
Whether or not He can see
to some so very great distance,
He is a person who has seen
the one goal that we wish.
If what it takes to qualify
is how far he can see,
Come then over here and take
the vulture as your Teacher.

Consider now the Able One, the Victorious Buddha, the One Gone Beyond.
It is right that all those who aspire for liberation should agree that He is totally
correct. This is because He has reached the ultimate point of knowledge where
He sees directly the causes for our getting trapped and for escaping: He sees
everything that we should take up (the end of suffering, and the path to it)
and everything we should give up (suffering and its source); and He sees the
method to follow here too.

It's not though that knowing every kind of thing there is, all the rocks and
tiny creatures at the bottom of the ocean, is all it takes to fulfill the wishes of
those who seek liberation.
It doesn't matter whether or not He can see to some so very great distance;
either way, the Teacher, the Transcendent Buddha, is the right one to take as
a teacher, for He is a person who has seen that one goal that those who seek
for freedom wish.

If what it takes to qualify as a person who is totally correct is nothing more
than how far one can see, then it would be proper to give the following advice
to people who are wishing to reach liberation:
Come then over here. It's true that a vulture is
nothing but a bird, but he does see to a very great
distance; and so you should take vultures or other
such beings as your Teacher.

In everyday life, people talk about how it is some being that was able to make
the world who is the omniscient one. This verse though serves to identify the
real nature of an omniscient being, which is one who understands in totality
all the details of what one should take up, and what you should give up.

TSE 'DIR MA CHAGS PAR PHYI MA PHAN CHAD DON DU GNYER BA ZHIG YIN NA 
Here is some advice for those of you who have no attachment to this present
life, and who aspire to goals of the next life, and beyond.

The one thing which is important, beyond all else, is to follow properly, in
your mind and in your deeds, a spiritual Guide who possesses the necessary
qualifications. And the way to find the Guide is to look for one who can teach
you, in exactly the right way, how to reach the goal that you desire. This
key--that is, what you really need to look for--is described with absolute
perfection by the Lord of Reasoning in the verse above.

We turn now to the point in the text which treats the lines from the "Sutra" on
Correct Perception which include "The One who turned correct, who helps all
beings." Here two steps are presented towards proving that the Teacher is a
person who is totally correct: using the forward order to show what path the
Teacher came from; and using the reverse order, putting forth evidence that He
could have come this way.

Here is the first.
[First: the "Reasoning of the Protector," which proves turning totally correct:]
Consider our Teacher.
He is someone who turned correct,
Because He possesses the quality of being an unsurpassed
Protector, who by teaching the four noble truths protects each and
every living being from suffering.

[Second: the "Reasoning of Eliminating Undesirable Qualities--the One who
Went to Bliss," which proves being the Protector:]
Consider the same One.
It is true that He possesses the quality of being an unsurpassed
Protector;
Because he has eliminated undesirable qualities, totally.

[Third: the "Reasoning of the Teacher," which proves having gone to bliss:]
Consider the same One.
It is true that He has previously eliminated all undesirable
qualities;
Because during His time on the paths of learning He has for the
sake of others acted in every way to practice continually on the
subjects of selflessness and so on, and because He has reached the
final perfection of this same practice.

DE CHOS CAN, DE LTAR GZHAN DON DU GOMS PA'I RGYU MTSAN YOD DE, THUGS RJE NI MTHAR PHYIN PA'I PHYIR,
[Fourth: the "Reasoning of Great Compassion," which proves being the
Teacher:]
Consider the same One.
There is a reason why He has practiced this way for the sake of
others;
Because He has reached the final perfection of compassion.

DE CHOS CAN, RTAG PA RANG BYUNG GI TSAD MA'I SKYES BU MA YIN TE, KHYOD KYIS SNGAR SNYING RJE'I STOBS KYIS SKYE BA RNAM PA DU MA BLANGS PA'I SGO NAS 'KHOR 'DAS KYI THABS MANG PO YUN RING DU GOMS PA LAS DE LTAR GYUR PA'I PHYIR,
[In summary,]
Consider this same One.
He is not a person who is totally correct and who is also
unchanging, who just came that way from the beginning;
Because He has turned this way by practicing, for a long period of
time, a great many methods that were both a part of the cycle of
life and also beyond it; and He did so over the course of many
different kinds of lives He has taken--driven all the while by His
compassion.

GNYIS PA LHAG MA BZHI BSHAD PA'I SGO NAS TSAD MA'I SKYES BU'I MTSAN NYID DANG DER BGROD PA'I LAM NGOS GZUNG BA LA,
Here secondly is how we identify the definition of a person who is totally
correct, and then the path for reaching this state, all by explaining the
remaining four parts of the quotation.

We will proceed in two steps: proving the four exceptional qualities, and then
showing how turning correct comes from them. The first of these two itself
has three parts, which are (1) identifying the perfected thought, (2) explaining
how the perfected action comes from it, and (3) showing how the perfected
result comes from these two.

,DANG PO LA, BSAM PA PHUN TSOGS DANG PO'I SGRUB BYED DU BSTAN PA DANG , DE MA GRUB PA SPANG BA'O, , DANG PO NI,
The first here also has two steps, which are showing that the perfected thought
is the first thing which helps bring about a person who is totally correct, and
then disproving arguments that it does not exist. Here now is the first.

The root text of Master Dharmakirti says--
It comes from practicing perfectly
what helps bring Him about: holy compassion.
As for the things that help bring about a person who is totally correct, holy
great compassion comes first: that is, before. This is because you must become
the Teacher first by giving birth within yourself to the compassion which
wants to liberate every living being from suffering, and then by practicing
perfectly the method for liberating them from suffering.

DE 'DRA THUGS RJE CHEN PO'ANG RANG GI RIGS 'DRA SNGA MA GOMS PA LAS GRUB PA'I PHYIR, SKABS 'DIR THUGS RJE CHEN PO DANG SNYING RJE CHEN PO GCIG TU BSHAD,
This kind of holy great compassion, moreover, comes about through constant
practice of earlier and similar forms. The two phrases terms "holy great
compassion" and "great compassion" are explained as being the same in this
particular instance.

The autocommentary to Entering the Middle Way says:

They do not possess the great masses of merit and of
wisdom, nor holy great compassion, nor omniscience
or the like. Therefore they are less than totally
enlightened Buddhas, and so are said to be "medium."
The Analysis of the Middle Way from our monastery quotes this passage and
says that therefore not even bodhisattvas have holy great compassion in their
mind streams.

In the seventh chapter of the Treasure House of Knowledge (the Abhidharmakosha),
eight distinctions between great compassion and holy great compassion are set
forth. This text states that holy great compassion is found only in the mental
stream of a realized being who is a Buddha. As the root text of the Treasure
says,
The Buddha's great compassion, deceptive mind.
Because of collection, aspect, activity object,
Evenness, for greatness in the extreme.
Distinctions between them of eight different types.

According to all this then, the difference between holy great compassion and
great compassion is vast, and holy great compassion is no path which is
practiced at the outset of the path of the greater way.

In this same vein, the majority of the textbooks of the great monasteries state
that there is no great compassion in the mind stream of a practitioner of the
lesser way. Our own textbooks though establish that enemy destroyers of the
Listener type do possess great compassion in their mind-streams; they do so
by using a quotation from the Dar commentary to the Higher Line.

DE YANG , SEMS CAN SDUG BSNGAL LAS SKYOB 'DOD KYI SNYING RJE MED KYANG , SDUG BSNGAL LAS 'BRAL 'DOD KYI SNYING RJE CHEN PO YOD PA GSUNGS,
They state moreover that, although these enemy destroyers lack the kind of
compassion where they wish to protect living beings from suffering, they do
have the kind where they wish to see them free of suffering.

RNAM BSHAD THAR LAM GSAL BYED LAS, SNYING RJE CHEN PO DE NYID THEG PA CHEN PO'I LAM SGOM PA'I THOG MA'I SGRUB BYED YIN PA DANG , ZHES DANG ,
The text called The Explication which is a Light on the Path to Freedom says that
"This great compassion is the one thing that allows one to reach the start of the
practice of the path of the greater way."

The Great Commentary, the Ocean of Reasoning, also says:
Any person who is able to develop in the stream of
his mind this one thing, the great compassion that
wishes to free each and every living creature from
suffering, has thereby become someone whom we can
speak of with the name "bodhisattva."

SNYING RJE CHEN PO NYID LUGS 'BYUNG GI SKABS SU THEG CHEN THUN MONG MA YIN PA'I LAM GYI 
THOG MAR BSHAD PA YIN NO,
It states as well that:
This one thing, great compassion, is explained in the
section on the forward order as being the beginning of
the path for the unique path of the greater way.

In addition, this same work states:
A certain attitude grows up in the bottom of one's
heart; a totally genuine state of mind where you wish
to free every living being from suffering. This very
state of mind is what we call "holy great compassion,"
or "great compassion."
As soon as this one thing has grown in your heart,
then we speak of you with the words "greater way."
This state of mind is moreover the starting point of
the unique path, and a special cause for achieving
omniscience.

SNYING RJE CHEN PO THEG PA CHEN PO'I LAM GYI THOG MA YIN PA DANG , THUGS RJE CHEN PO DANG SNYING RJE CHEN PO GNYIS MING GI RNAM GRANGS SU BSHAD DO,
Great compassion therefore is explained as being the starting point for the path
of the greater way; and holy great compassion and great compassion are said
to be two different words for the same thing.

In the Greater Steps of the Path, the Sutra Requested by Ocean of Understanding is
first quoted. Then Lord Tsongkapa goes on to describe the example of a
family person with an especially beloved son who suddenly falls into a great
pit of filth. Even practitioners of the Listener and Self-Made Buddha types
possess a kind of compassion which is similar to the one that the boy's mother
and different relations feel, where they wish to pull him out of the pit. Only
a bodhisattva though, he says, possesses the kind of compassion which is like
the concern felt by the boy's father.

Judging from this description, our own monastery's textbooks appear to be
correct on this point. This is because compassion which is like the mother's
love for his son is had by Listeners and Self-Made Buddhas as well, and that
in itself satisfies entirely the definition of great compassion.

'ON KYANG , SNYING RJE'I SNGON DU GCES SHING PHANGS PA'I YID DU 'ONG BA'I BYAMS PA DANG , DRIN GZO DRIN DRAN, MAR SHES SOGS 'GRO DGOS PAS,
We should note though that prior to developing compassion one must go
through the steps of "beautiful" love, which cherishes and values its object; as
well as wanting to repay kindness, recalling kindness, realizing that they have
been your mother, and so on.

NYAN RANG LA DE DAG SGOM PA YOD MED DPYAD DGOS,
Whether or not Listeners and Self-Made Buddhas meditate on these various
steps is something we would have to investigate.

Here secondly is the part where we disprove arguments that the perfected
thought even exists. First we will present the arguments themselves, and then
show how we disprove them.

DANG PO NI, RTZA BAR, BLO NI LUS LA BRTEN PA'I PHYIR, GOMS PAS GRUB PA MED CE NA ZHES TSIG GNYIS TE,
The first of these two is indicated in two lines of the root text:
Suppose you say that,
because of the fact that the mind
Is something that relies on the body,
there is no achieving by practice.

Those of the Charvaka School say:
Your statement that a person practices compassion
over the length of many lifetimes, and then turns into
a person who is totally correct, is wrong. This is
because there are no past or future lives, and
awareness in the mind is something that relies on the
body.

They say that there are three ways in which the mind relies on the body. First
of all they say the mind is a quality of the body, similar to alcohol and the
ability to make someone drunk. Secondly mind is part of the nature of the
body, as with a wall and a design on the wall. Lastly the mind is a result of
the body, in the way of a lamp and its light.
And they say that, because the mind relies on the body, the awareness in the
mind dies when the body dies.

The Great Commentary states that "It is explained through similes, and the way
one thing stops when another does [?]." The Jewel of Valid Perception says,
They believe there is no achieving through practice,
Due to the fact of three different ways:
The mind is an integral part of the body,
A result of the body, and one of its qualities.

[From A Number of Necessities, which Those Who Seek for Freedom should Cherish
like the Heart in their Breast:]

MKHAS GRUB KYI TSAD MA SDE BDUN YID KYI MUN SEL LAS,
The following excerpt is taken from Clearing Away Darkness of the Mind about
the Seven Books of Valid Perception, a text composed by Kedrup Je.

SKYES BU SKYES MA THAG GI RIG PA DE LA RGYU MED NA, RES 'GA' YIN PAS GNOD LA,
Suppose you say that the mind of a person who was just born has no cause.
You are disproven by the fact that this mind is variable.

Suppose thus that this mind does have a cause. Is this cause unchanging or
changing? If it were an unchanging thing that could perform some function,
then there would be no possibility that it did not apply in every place and at
every time; and so there would be no possibility of its having a fixed
relationship where it came and went according to its result.

PHYI MA LTAR NA, BEM RIG GANG RUNG LAS GZHAN PA'I DNGOS PO LAS SKYE BAR MI 'THAD 
PAS, GANG RUNG LAS SKYE DGOS LA,
Suppose then that the latter were true, [and that the cause of this mind were
changing.] It would be incorrect to say that this mind could arise from any
working thing other than matter or mind, and so it must come from one or the
other of these two.

BEM POS NYER LEN BYED NA, DBANG PO DANG BCAS PA'AM, PHYI ROL GYI BEM POS YIN,
Suppose you say that matter provides the material cause for this mind. Is it
the kind of matter which involves the powers of sense, or is it matter outside
of them?

Suppose you say it's the first of the two. Is this cause one where all the
various sense powers must come together, or is any one or combination of
them enough? If the first is the case, then mental consciousness would fail to
arise if the sense power of the eye were absent. If the latter is the case, then
one's thoughts would have to be able to capture visible objects with the same
kind of clarity that the consciousness of the eye does.

PHYI ROL GYI BEM POS NYER LEN BYED NA, YAN LAG CAN GYI RDZAS KYIS SAM, RDUL PHRAN GYIS BYED, DANG PO LTAR NA, YAN LAG CAN GYI RDZAS CHA BCAS CHA MED GNYIS LAS,
Suppose you say that it's outer matter which provides the material cause. Is
it matter in the sense of some substance which is a whole, or is it atoms?
Suppose you say it's the first. The substance which is a whole can only be
something with parts or something without parts.

CHA BCAS KYIS NYER LEN BYED PA NI, CHA THAMS CAD TSOGS PA RGYUR DGOS SAM, GANG RUNG RES CHOG CES PA GONG GI RIGS PA'I TSUL GYIS KHEGS LA,
Suppose you say it's a whole with parts that provides the material cause. We
deny you then with the same reasoning we used before: Is this cause one
where all the various parts must come together, or is any one or combination
enough?

YAN LAG RNAMS LAS RDZAS THA DAD PA'I YAN LAG CAN CHA MED KYIS NYER LEN BYED NA, GDONG GOS KYIS BSGRIBS NA, YAN LAG GZHAN RNAMS KYANG GOS KYIS BSGRIBS PA DANG , GZHAN MA BSGRIBS NA BSGRIBS MA BSGRIBS CHA GNYIS SU YOD PAR 'GYUR BA DANG , BSGRIBS MA BSGRIBS CHA GNYIS YAN LAG RNAMS LA YOD KYI YAN LAG CAN LA MED NA, GDONG GOS KYIS BSGRIBS PA'I TSE YAN LAG CAN GYI GDONG GSAL BAR MTHONG BAR THAL LA,
Suppose you say that it's a substance which is a whole, and which has no
parts, and which exists distinct from its details, which provides the material
cause for the mind. Then when you covered your face with a piece of cloth all
the other details of your body would have to be covered as well. If the other
details didn't get covered then there would come to be two parts: one that was
covered and one that wasn't. These two parts, the covered one and the
uncovered one, would be something that applied to the details but not to the
whole that had the details. This being the case, you would have to be able to
see clearly the face of the whole even when the face as a detail was covered
with the cloth.

DE BZHIN DU G-YO MI G-YO DANG , KHA BSGYUR MA BSGYUR SOGS LA SBYAR BA'I RIGS PA RNAMS KYIS GNOD DO, ,
This position is equally disproven by reasoning that treats other distinctions,
such as moving one of your limbs or not, and turning to one side or not.

BAR 'GYUR RO, ,
Suppose you say that atoms provide the material cause for the mind. If it's
that the mind arises through each of the atoms, acting independently of each
other, then many different mental consciousnesses would have to arise at the
same time. If it's that the atoms must act all together in a group, then the
mind could never arise if even a single atom were absent.

This reasoning, where we use the process of eliminating all other possibilities,
brings us to the conclusion that the material cause for mind is mind itself.

The mind that acts as the cause must moreover either be one which is part of
yourself or one which is part of someone else. Suppose you say that a mind
which is part of someone else, of someone like your father or mother, acts as
the direct material cause for this mind. The problem then arises that--where
the father is a skilled artisan, or say foolish, or whatever--the son must always
be this way as well.

RANG RGYUD KYI RIG PA SNGA MA KHO NAS NYER LEN BYED PAR 'GYUR LA,
This leads us to conclude that it can only be a former mind which is part of
our own stream of consciousness that provides the material cause [for our

As for the former of these two, we first present the proofs, and then eliminate
objections to them. The root text covering the proofs for the existence of past
and future lives goes from the line "When a person goes to take his birth" up
to the line "Must only see them at every single time." The refutation of

attempted proofs that these lives do not exist is explained in the root text from
the line "The final state of mind, to another mind" through to the line "We
assert such proofs to be unsure."

The section on presenting the proofs is explained in the root text from "When
a person goes to take his birth" up to "Later too it will become the same." The
root text for eliminating objections to these proofs goes from the root text line
"Because of the fact that its consciousness gives assistance" up to the line "Must
only see them at every single time."

Given this text, consider now an infant who has just taken birth: consider his
breathing in and out, the clarity of his powers, the feeling of anxiety in his mind,
and so forth. When a person goes to take his birth, these are nothing such that
they are not dependent on something of their own type which has come before,
because the infant is now possessed of this in-out breath, and the clarity of his
powers, anxiety in his mind, and so on.

Then too there would never be any part of earth and "such" (meaning any one of

So if the powers and the mind and such could ever occur just from the elements,
without depending each upon something of their own type which came before

Even if you hurt each one of all the powers, it isn't always the case that the mind
is also hurt. But suppose it, the mind, changes because it is hurt by feelings of
grief or the like. It is something we can see then that they--the powers--change
too. Therefore the mind is a very special basis for these powers; and it is
something which depends on the mind itself, meaning former instances of its
same type. Moreover, a number of cases of mental action, or karma, from one's
past life are now the basis for the mind to stay. For these reasons then the mind
is not something which has no basis of its own.

These powers are something then that comes from mind, since they--a number of
previous instances of mind--are the cause that projects the future occurrence of
all the various powers. And later on, things like the mind at the moment of
death too will become the same as these previous cases, crossing the line into
later states of a similar type. This is because the same (meaning the same type
of) projecting ones (that is, causes) are there.

The root text and its commentary just given present different reasonings to
prove the existence of past and future lives. This is because when you prove
that the passing in and out of breath with an infant who has just been born (or
any of the other examples) comes from something of the same type which
occurred previously, one can understand that the "same type" refers to the
inhaling and exhaling of the past life, and so on.

Suppose you say that the powers and so forth of someone who has just now
taken birth could occur only from the various elements. We can see that in
one glass of water there grows one bug with a red head and a yellow body,
and then another with a yellow head and a red body. Some creatures come
out smaller, and others come out larger.

Among humans as well some come with larger bodies, and then some with
smaller ones. Certain people come with a very sharp intellect, and others with
one which is dull. Some children display a great amount of understanding and
love and the like, while others show a tendency towards attachment and other
bad thoughts. According to you, these and similar cases should be impossible,
because beings take birth only through the elements, without having to depend
on any earlier instance of a similar type.

Suppose again that creatures were born only from the elements. Then when
any one element turned into a creature, all the elements would have to turn
into creatures. This is because there would be no cause or condition that
would make one of the two occur, and the other not occur.

Our own position is that a number of instances of mind in the past act as
projecting causes, and from them occur our present powers and so on, which
are such that they result from karma, through a time-lag. And since a number
of instances of mind in the form of the mind at the moment of death will also
provide a cause, for the powers and so forth that come later, we are able to

establish that future lives exist.

For this reason, it is not always the case that the mind is affected when you
hurt any one of the five sense powers. On the other hand, it is invariably the
case that when the mind is affected by strong emotions of grief, or by various
harmful influences, then it does hurt the physical powers. When for example
the mind is affected by powerful feelings of fear, the sense power of the tongue
can no longer taste something as delicious.

One may present the following argument:
What about a case where the power of the eye is
damaged, and because of this the consciousness of the
eye loses its ability to see its object? Isn't it common
knowledge that you then undergo some feelings of
distress, and that these affect the mind?

This though is no problem. It is true that such cases are possible, but it is not
that mind is affected by the damage to the sense power. Rather, the damage
to the eye power provides a general condition for a separate occurrence, the

distress. The distress itself increases to a point to where the mind as well is
affected.

It is not though the case that the mind is affected solely by the damage to the
sense power of the eye. This is because there are instances where certain great
beings have given away their very eyes, and yet still felt emotions of great
happiness within their minds.

As such, the mind provides a very unique cause, a sine qua non, for a
corresponding result: the sense powers and so on. The powers and the rest
though do not provide this same kind of cause for any state of mind resulting
from them.

To summarize, let us consider the mind of someone who has just taken birth.
A previous state of mind has come before it, because it (the one at birth) is a
state of mind. It is, for example, like one's current state of mind. This is the
reasoning for proving the existence of former lives.

THA MAL PA'I 'CHI KHA'I RIG PA CHOS CAN, RIG PA PHYI MA MTSAMS SBYOR TE, CHAGS BCAS KYI RIG PA YIN PA'I PHYIR, DPER NA, KHA SANG GI RIG PA BZHIN ZHES PA DE SKYE BA PHYI MA SGRUB PA'I RIGS PA'O,
Consider further the mind at the moment of death, for an ordinary person. It
will cross the line into a later state of mind, because it is a state of mind where
attachment is present. It is, for example, like one's state of mind from the day
before. This is the reasoning for proving existence of future lives.

If one gets caught up in the wording, it might seem that we are asking you to
consider a former state of mind, and arguing that a former state of mind has
preceded it, since it is a state of mind. Or else it sounds like we are saying one
should consider a later state of mind, and arguing that it will cross the line into
a later state of mind, because it is state of mind where attachment is present.
It would seem that we had accepted that all these reasons were true, and that
all the necessities held. And it would seem as though one could never accept
these arguments, for in each case elements were the same.

These proofs are similar to where Master Kamalashila proves past and future
lives in his Concise Commentary on Suchness, for there he states:
A state of mind such that desire is present in it does
have the ability to give birth to yet another state of
mind, the one that we take on at birth. This is

because the state of mind at death for an ordinary
person is similar to states of mind on previous
occasions where desire was present: it too has desire.
The text goes on to state that these are types of reasoning where the quality
asserted and the quality accepted share a nature.

With both the reasonings presented above, you would have to perceive past
and future lives if you perceived what the reasonings are trying to prove.
Therefore it will be necessary for us to examine what object we can utilize as
a starting point for perceiving past and future lives.

Reading Ten: Selections on How Ignorant Desire Triggers
Another Life

`, MKHAS GRUB BSTAN PA DAR RGYAS KYIS BRTZAMS PA'I RTEN 'BREL SPYI DON NAS,
The first selection is from the Overview of Dependent Origination by Kedrup
Tenpa Dargye (1493-1568).

.
The definition of that ignorance which constitutes the first of the twelve links
in the chain of dependent origination is: "That view of the perishable
assemblage [view of a "me" or "mine" which has its own nature] which inspires
one to commit fresh cases of the relevant second link--that of immature karma."

The definition of that immature karma which constitutes the second link in the
chain of dependent origination is: "That impure movement of the mind which
is of the type that is inspired freshly by the relevant first link, of ignorance."

This particular immature karma can be divided into three types: merit, non-
meritorious karma, and unshifting karma. Meritorious karma and unshifting
karma are not mutually exclusive, for there does exist something which can be
both basic virtue which is consistent with merit and also the causal form of
balanced concentration.

There are various typical examples of these three. The first would be the
karma which projects as a karmic result the parts of a person who takes birth
in one of the better forms of life in the desire realm. The second would be a
karma which projects as a karmic result the parts of a person who takes birth
in one of the three lives of misery. The third would be a karma which projects
as a karmic result the parts of a person who takes birth in one of the higher
two realms.

The definition of that craving which constitutes the eighth link in the chain of

This particular craving can be divided into three types: desire craving, fear
craving, and existence craving. Each of these three can be described in the
following typical examples. The first is that craving where you desire not to
be separated from an attractive object. The second is that craving where you
desire to be separated from an unattractive object. The third is that craving
wherein you crave the parts of your being at the time of your death, out of fear
that you think you are going to stop.

The definition of that grasping which constitutes the ninth link in the chain of

This particular grasping may be divided into four types: grasping to the
desirable, grasping to views, grasping where you profess the existence of a self-

practices to be supreme.

The first of these is a kind of desire which is strongly attached to an attractive
object. The second is a kind of desire which is strongly attached to bad views.
The third is a kind of desire which is strongly attached to professing that a
self-nature of a person exists. The fourth is a kind of desire which is strongly

These two links possess certain typical characteristics. Among the three
categories of being virtuous and so on, they are invariably ethically neutral.
There are types of each which are eliminated by the path of seeing, and types

possible. These links are found with both normal beings and with realized
beings, and are had by beings in all three realms.

The definition of that ripened karma which constitutes the tenth link of the
chain of dependent origination is: "The movement of the mind which is in its
essence an impure ripening where karma has become extremely potent due to
its being triggered by the relevant links of craving and grasping."

Suppose because he's free of the perishable view
He would stop rebirth at the beginning of the path.
Because the innate one's not yet eliminated.
If it were, then how could there ever be a rebirth?

Suppose someone makes the following argument: "Let's say that you are right,
and that the view of the perishable assemblage [seeing some "me" or "mine"
with a self-nature] is the very root of the cycle of rebirth. Well then, just after
a person had been able to develop the beginning moments of the path of
seeing, he would have stopped himself from ever crossing again the line into
a new rebirth. Why? Because he's free then of the perishable view."

Our answer then would be as follows: "Consider a stream enterer [a person
who has reached the path of seeing, and seen emptiness directly.] Isn't it
rather the case that he has not yet reached a point where, because he has
eliminated the perishable view, he need not take another rebirth? Because isn't
it true that the innate one, the inborn perishable view, is not yet eliminated?
And if it were eliminated, then how could there ever be a rebirth? In that
case then he could of course never take another rebirth."

You could also answer: "Consider then a stream enterer who sees peace in that
same life [that is, who reaches nirvana in the same life in which he reached the
path of seeing]. How could there ever be a rebirth for someone like this? He
is one of those people who is certain to eliminate the perishable view
completely, and thereby achieve nirvana, in the same life that he reaches the
path of seeing.

That state of mind where a person thinks of "me,"
Where he wishes to himself "May I be happy,"
Or "May I never suffer any pain,"
This viewpoint of a person is the innate.

And suppose you say, "Perishable view only comes in one kind: the type
where you consciously believe [in a "me" or "mine" which has its own nature].
Therefore it is not the cause for suffering existence." It is not true though that
there exists no innate form of the perishable view. Think of that case where
a person wishes a certain object, where he thinks to himself, "May I be
happy," or "May I never suffer any pain." Without being influenced by any
kind of intellectual belief, he holds to a "me," he thinks of a "me" who is
independent, and who is not just a label applied to the various parts of
himself. That particular state of mind is the viewpoint of a person which is
the innate one.

And are you saying then that people like stream enterers [those who have seen
emptiness directly but have not yet reached nirvana] have no attachment at all
to some kind of "self"? You must be, because [according to you] they never
think they see any kind of "me." If you agree, then you must be saying that
they could never be the kind of people who race on to the next life through
a desire for happiness [for a self-existent "me," and yet they are.] This would
have to be the case, because they would be free of this craving to a self-

nature.

The Great Commentary says: "Wherever a person never thinks they see any
kind of "me," then they have no attachment at all to some kind of "self."
And because they are free of this craving to a self-nature, then they can never
race on again to a next life through a desire for "my-self's" happiness."

We should note at this point that it is incorrect to assert, as some have done,
that the simple awareness of oneself constitutes the perishable view. This is
proven by the fact that enemy destroyers and Buddhas do possess states of
mind in which they think to themselves, "These are my robes," or "This is my
wisdom bowl."

If you disagree that this could ever be the case, then you would have to say as
well that there could never exist that failure in one's monastic vows where you
steal the robes or bowl or any similar article belonging to one of these beings.
This would have to be the case, for these beings would according to you lack
any state of mind where they considered something "mine." A lack of such a
state should always mean that one could not steal from such beings, for the
following distinction is correctly made: So long as the Teacher is still blessing

the world with His presence, there can occur the failure of one's vows where
he steals what rightfully belongs to the Teacher; and yet, after He pretends to
pass into His final nirvana, such a failure can no longer occur.

There are moreover those lines in Entering [the Middle Way], which talk about
being
Like the case where Buddhas, who are
free of the view
Of the perishable assemblage, still speak of
'me' and 'my teaching'."

From the one cause of being attached to some self-nature,
They conceive of what's not happiness as happiness,
And as a result they dive into everything;
Therefore craving's a basis for rebirth.

   SRED PA CHOS CAN, RKYEN GYI RNAM PA YIN TE, RANG 'BRAS YANG SRID PHYI MA'I LHAN CIG BYED PA'I RTEN YIN PA'I PHYIR,
Consider now craving. It is the [aspect of the truth of the source of suffering
we call] "factor." This is because it is a basis which contributes to a
corresponding result; ie, another rebirth.

It is true that craving is this way, because those who have been brought down
by the tendency to conceive of what's not happiness as being happiness dive
as a result of this into "everything," which refers to unworthy things and
goals. Neither is it true that this totally mistaken backwards conception of
things is without its proper cause, for all this occurs from the one cause of
being attached to some self-nature.

Because of the fact that the Masters have said
"Those free of attachment will never see birth."

It is true that craving is a cause for a future rebirth, because of the fact that
Masters of the past have said that "Enemy destroyers, those who are free of
attachment, never again see a birth in some future life; this is due to the fact
that they have eliminated craving in its entirety."
